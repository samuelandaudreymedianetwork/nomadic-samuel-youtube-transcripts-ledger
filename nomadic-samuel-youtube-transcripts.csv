and i decided to embark upon a weight loss challenge this past summer and fall to improve our health by eating clean exercising and eliminating bad habits with the father and son challenge of losing a combined 50 pounds we gave ourselves a target that would inspire us to make some necessary changes in our lives we're in no way shape or form health professionals so consult with your doctor or nutritionist if you want to try something similar in this video we show everything from the food we ate the exercises that help us to shed unwanted pounds and the challenges we encountered along the way turning this into a challenge kept us both accountable and our message to you is simple and clear we're just regular guys that love to eat so if we can do it anyone can do it now on to the challenge hey hey guys greetings from fredericton new brunswick canada i'm with my dad right now how you doing well i'm doing great yeah it's great to see you again it's been it's been too long yeah it's almost uh not quite a year but it's it's getting pretty close yeah vancouver island was the last time so it's great to be back home and unlike most episodes where we're filming travel and food videos we've got a special challenge we're actually going to be doing a father and son weight loss challenge we want to shed a combined 50 pounds that's right yeah and like father's day just passed and yeah we uh we normally exchange gifts or or i usually get together so we decided to have a unique uh present and what the present is they're present to each other right which is we're gonna try to lose 25 pounds each yeah or combine 50 uh within two months yeah we're really excited about it we're looking forward to uh to the challenge we're going to show the entire process like the behind the scenes the cooking the exercise the weigh-ins ups and downs basically everything i'm really enthusiastic about it and let's go let's do it well moments of truth we had our very first weigh-ins this morning and what did you start off at i started off at 206 which is five pounds less than what i started tracking with i started tracking on june the 12th yeah and i was 211 so i get five pounds in the bank yeah we're giving you credit because you've been a good boy lately so yeah you already get five pounds of credit i don't i'll explain why and for me my very first morning weigh-in was 190 pounds exactly wow and it's not bad but you know what i had gone down a little bit lower and i've been kind of trending in the other direction unlike you so i get zero credit and the other thing i'd like to mention is that we are in no way shape or form health experts we're not doctors we're not nutritionists so if you're thinking of doing like a weight loss protocol yourself you should definitely consult your own physician and nutritionist before starting we're not going to tell you anything you don't already know right so there you go that's true that's true well good morning good morning how are you feeling this morning a little uh tired but uh not too bad normal i guess i haven't had my coffee yet so yeah we're kind of like bears without our coffee that's right so anyways we thought we'd show a complete day in the life including what we have for breakfast lunch and dinner also what we do for exercise and yeah we're gonna get started with a bit of coffee and a bit of fruit okay let's get going oh breakfast of champions yeah so i normally just have fruit now in in the morning just a small plate two varieties of grapes and some cherries and that's uh they'll that'll do me till uh until noon till noon yeah and i've already had a about a 13 to 14 hour fast from uh from last night's supper so right you usually have supper between five and six yeah and we're trying not to have a single morsel after that yeah and then breakfast typically maybe between eight and nine yeah on an average day yeah along with with some coffee as well yeah dark coffee like nothing nothing had nothing in it yeah nothing added no sugar no milk no no fun stuff in there it's called black coffee yeah yeah yeah just straight up and my breakfast is just as simple as yours you have two items of fruit same with me i basically take a banana granny smith apple typically and that's all i'm having as well we're trying to keep breakfast nice and light so that we can burn a lot of calories like especially if you think of the fasting window we've had between dinner and breakfast and then having a fairly low calorie breakfast hi i'm just by the st john river on my bike i just i just got off my bike and uh i just came across the uh the old train bridge which is probably the most important recreational spot in the whole city okay yeah really it is it's a link that links the north and south but it also just it's just a meeting place for everybody even for tourists on on a warm summer night when it's humid that's the best place to be right in the middle of that bridge because you always get a breeze okay probably the only other city in canada that has the trails that fredericton has is ottawa okay so we're they have one up on us but we're probably number two the network of uh trails goes runs east-west north-south and it connects up to highways my most favorite ride is to the north which is along the nashua river that's a beautiful ride yeah you get out there you can go as far as uh the bottom of mountain hope which is uh there's a brand new bridge there from downtown and back it's about 50k ride so it's just an excellent ride so biking is definitely your preferred exercise oh definitely riding riding my bike really allows me to do uh you know more than an hour or two exercises like to do the 50k ride it's about maybe two and a quarter hours so yeah that's a good workout and have you found that the riding your bike has helped you with your weight loss as well definitely like if if i'm doing the uh the 50k ride i always leave a pound behind on the trail wow that's that's what i call it that's amazing so what's going to happen now is i'm going to walk back home and you're going to do your real bike ride i'm going to continue with my real bike ride yeah that's excellent i'll see you back at the ranch there in about an hour bud yeah and we're going to have lunch together okay see ya see ya all right guys so we got our exercise in this morning we've worked up a bit of an appetite and i'm going to show you i call this the wheel of fortune platter and basically it starts off with fermented vegetables i'm going to be adding a little bit of kimchi okay and then i'm going to be adding sauerkraut we also have pickled beets so those are the first three items then we're going to be putting some chopped up vegetables we've got cucumber celery a little bit of tomato lettuce and carrot so lots of fresh veggies okay then what we'll have to dip those into a little bit of hummus and then we're going to move on in the platter to a little bit of fruit we've got cherries two different kinds of grapes green and red and then we move on to uh healthy protein and fats so we're gonna have there's some brazil nuts and some cashews in here we'll be adding salted almonds and because we're on our diet protocol we're not going to be putting too much of this on the plate some raw pumpkin seeds we also have some peanuts with sea salt and cracked pepper black pepper and walnuts wow so what what i normally do for for for my mom's plate is i give her a tiny treat at the end that's why i call it the wheel of fortune platter so she's going to have like a mint or a piece of licorice because we're on our protocol we're not going to have that so our wheel of fortune is probably our fruit and our nuts so you get a prize right at the end of the plate right yeah yeah yeah it's uh just i i don't know why i thought of that as a healthy way of having uh having lunch so you kind of work your way around here to the little treat at the end you gotta sell you gotta sell the plate yeah so i'm gonna prepare it and i'll show you what it looks like when it's all done your wheel of fortune platter food platter has been served wow that looks awesome sam does that look good it's uh we kind of went all out we put a little bit more vegetables and we also have the special ingredient of mackerel which you requested i can't remember the last time i had mackerel never never from a can wow i we caught some fresh mackerel like a long long time ago go ahead and dig in wow well just wait i just wanted to add one more thing all right okay just a little bit of pepper ground pepper for the for the veggies do you have any favorite items on the plate that you that you enjoy the most well i'll tell you what i love i love anything pickled yep okay so i like that love hummus i like everything super healthy lots of variety and also easy to prepare it just took me maybe five ten minutes to whip the sauce that's awesome and look at the variety on that plate so yeah this is what our typical lunch has been looking like um the only time we don't eat this is if we have leftovers from uh from the supper from the night before but i'd be i'd say we have platters between between four to six times a week yeah depending on on that situation right all right and it's time for supper and so we're going to be making a chicken stir fry as we had mentioned earlier my mom's already done all the prep for us which is amazing so basically i have a bowl of mushrooms yellow peppers chives and onions so i'm going to be cooking those up but before i do that i'm going to be making a stir-fry sauce that calls for a bit of peanut butter it also costs calls for sesame oil soy sauce beef broth crushed red pepper flakes and garlic and ginger so i'm going to go ahead and prepare that sauce and we'll pick it up from there all right so we have made the sauce smells so good but this is actually going to be one of the last stages first what we're going to do is we're going to cook up the vegetables i'm going to pour a little olive oil in the pan cook them up the chicken's already been pre-cooked and throwing the sauce on will be the last stage okay so we're at the final stages i have added the sauce i've throw i threw in a couple handfuls of cashews it is smelling good guys this is gonna be our dinner we're gonna we're gonna end things right here but what we're gonna be doing is just putting a little bit on our bowl very good everything blends really well together nice all right so that is a full day of eating we showed you breakfast lunch and dinner and we will uh we'll pick it up with uh with something else a few days later all right guys so the whole point of this challenge we still haven't talked about the why why we're doing it yeah and um yeah there's some very specific reasons so uh i guess i'll go first so basically in my early 30s i gained quite a bit of weight i put on 20 30 even sometimes like when when i was at my heaviest even more than 40 pounds from what my ideal set point was in my 20s yeah and i've had a lot of unsuccessful attempts to to try to lose that weight so when audrey and i have been in between trips i've often tried some extreme protocols that have involved like really serious calorie restriction yeah along with heavy duty exercise and i found that to be my breaking point that's almost never worked for me you just didn't balance out it yeah the reason being is that when i when i do a lot of jogging or weight lifting like like heavy duty exercise it really increases my appetite and when i when i keep my calories really low for three or four days i'm sore i'm tired i'm irritable and eventually i kind of reach a breaking point and i go out and have a cheat day have a binge day and then basically yeah i basically reverse almost all of the all the weight loss i've had kind of the classic yo-yo dies so maybe i'll take two steps forward one step back two steps forward two steps back so the the results haven't haven't always been there so this time around what i'm doing is i'm focusing more on lower calorie restriction with very light impact and exercise okay so instead of doing jogging and weightlifting and things like that i'm just doing low impact walking and stretching and things that that are just that don't really increase my my appetite as much and i'm finding so far that it's been a lot easier yeah and i just eventually once i do reach my target weight like once we're done this challenge i will do the the the exercising again yeah but i want to save that until until i reach my goal you can also do some strengthening exercises as well right so i wanted to mention um in the past that in my early 20s i did put on some weight in university and i successfully lost it probably about 20 to 25 pounds at the time and i kept that weight off for almost eight nine years so i i reached that i reached that goal and i had my my new set point and i kept it off so a big part of this challenge for me is not just going to be the challenge itself but wanting to maintain this new set point and i'm also just very much looking forward to the the health benefits that come with this just to feel to feel slimmer to feel trimmer to feel more fit and to hopefully have more energy for me the reason why i want to do this weight challenge is that i have a diabetes 2 condition and i've had since i've been 50 years old and now i'm 68 anything i can do to help my uh my intake and my exercise puts a lot a lot less uh stress or pressure on my diabetes and right it's very helpful yeah we've we've heard information that like weight loss can can very much help it also i think the like with my challenge of not binge eating you're you've been working on a different lifestyle change i used to just have like a carb and and fruit in the morning so i cut out the carb i just have fruit now and i have a light lunch yeah whatever whatever is there sometimes leftovers but we've also included the wheel of fortune tray i think one of the biggest changes though has been for you has been you haven't been snacking at night anymore yeah exactly i've had a normal sized uh supper and then from there on uh i i've i've cut out the snacking at night which was my biggest nemesis i think so i've been successful since june 12th uh to do that and uh my results have been surprisingly good so yeah you've you've been amazingly disciplined and i gotta give you huge credit for that well it's uh for me if i get on the right track and i track myself and if i stay on that right track that's when the results start showing up and uh if i can do that then i'll be okay what the other thing i wanted to talk to you about was um almost 10 years ago you did something really inspiring you had your your high school was it your 40th high school reunion yeah it was happening ontario the high school reunion in in kappa ontario and what i did was again i i set up a tracking program for myself and i made a a blog site and it took a lot of pictures put some music on the blog site and i also put in brackets what my weight loss or what my weight was during that time right so yeah i went from about 2 12 down to 185 wow 185 was the reason why i wanted to get to 185 was uh that was my my weight when i graduated from high school so oh that's amazing i was able to i was able to do it yeah i remember you told me that some of your uh some of the people who hadn't seen you in almost 40 years thought i thought you look great look why you look the only campus yeah i i i wish i had a stayed that way but unfortunately i got back to the same old habits that it did it is what it is yeah i mean this is why we're doing this challenge again and i think what's been helping us for this particular challenge is just the fact we're doing it together we can we can help each other we can uh humor each other we can yeah we can provide encouragement and track each other attract each other too so uh the fact that we're doing it together the fact it's a father-son project has made it um not only more enjoyable but i think it's going to ultimately lead to the successes so one of the first things that we're going to show you in the kitchen is a drink we've been having at night it really is helpful for digestion yeah and uh it's been working for us now we've been doing this for almost two and a half years wow so a family friend introduced this to you yeah that's right yeah so we're going to show you the whole process in case you're not familiar with kefir it's basically there's kefir greens we're going to be making a water kefir you can also do milk kefir but um yeah basically it's fermented greens and it's supposed to give you aid in digestion i think it increases your probiotics so yeah we're going to show the whole process because my dad makes it himself this is a lineup that we use to make the kefir we have pure water that's filtered we have organic raisins organic apricots we have organic molasses and we have organic sugar that we use everything organic amazing now we use about three quarters of a cup of sugar this is the key for seeds that have been in the fridge from the last batch okay so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to pour those in there okay that's that's a nice big jar that's how we start it yeah okay okay then the next thing we do put in the sugar it doesn't matter which order you do it in as long as you get it all the way okay you got to make sure you eat it and then when it gets in there what i'm going to do is i'm going to put in some water okay right now pour that in so this process takes a couple of days is that right uh it takes three or four days depending on how long you want the fermentation this is it's going to be a fermentation process okay take some raisins this helps the fermentation process okay yep and then you take a few dried apricots organic put those in there drop them in molasses and it's about maybe two tablespoons of that oh nice you got that down to a science yeah wow look at that you can see it actually yeah you can see it in there and see if it's seeping to the bottom oh look at that everything kind of mixes in together yeah cloth and you've got a rubber elastic rubber elastic make sure that's down it'll be in the cupboard for three or four days depending on how much you like the fermentation process and we like it quite fermentably you like it if you like it fermented more than leave it in for four days if you don't like it quite so much then you can only leave it for three days so basically what we'll do is we'll pick it up at the next stage obviously we're going to give it a few days and we're also going to try it on camera okay time for a kefir update yes uh the kefir is fully fermented ready to be processed yeah i'm ready unveiling of it right here i'm ready everything has risen to the top the uh some of the seeds are up there but uh all the uh all the dry fruit apricots are up there some raisins are up there as well we had mentioned one of the reasons you were doing this challenge was that you wanted to improve your your your type 2 diabetes your blood sugar levels yeah and you just had a and your doctor talked to your talk to the doctor on your phone today what what were the results well the results went from over eight uh blood sugar down to 6.3 and that's normal that's one month yeah that's just one month that was just one month of being on this protocol when you do your next reading you're going to have probably three months of this yeah my doctor's going to fall off your chair it's amazing here's a strainer yeah i've got a large bowl yeah a large strainer and i just well that's a huge pour it in wow and uh this here this is our kefir container right over here pour that right in directly directly right let's fill it up well all this time has led up to this moment right yeah so this is just poured straight in this is the final product right here it's uh ready for drinking we've had our supper and now it's a little bit after supper so you can have a drink of this it's a little sour but it helps digestion it also increases your probiotics it's natural and something you need something something you can make great in your own you basically make it faithfully as soon as you run out you make the next batch make the next match yeah okay friends so it's been a little while since we've done an update we decided to pick things up in the kitchen um you've got a specialty dish that you're gonna be making for us i just i like to make hummus and uh it's a little bit different from most most other hummuses everybody can add their personal touch to it and i've i've done that to to mine so we're right in the kitchen i'm gonna go behind the camera and you're gonna show uh how you make it okay so first first thing i do is i take about three or four cloves and i chop them up real finely and i'm just holding garlic yeah closing garlic yeah garlic is in there and i i have a juicer here a natural juicer so this is basically lemons yeah i usually take two lemons two full lemons yeah okay and that makes it nice and zesty huh oh yeah here's the juice from it right here we'll pour that in and with the garlic and olive oil how much do you put in oh about maybe that much over that much is next is tahini tahini we have about two thirds of a jar left so we're gonna put in one one heaping tablespoon two two heaping tablespoons three and one more we have the basic ingredients in what i call there's two mixtures here you have the uh you have this mixture which is uh got the tahini the garlic the lemon lemon i had one secret ingredient right here and it's a little bit of cayenne pepper oh it gives it some kick huh it'll slow burn all the way down there guys we love we're a family that loves spicy food so okay the hand blenders are ready to go and i will use this also again when i when i add the chickpeas and everything okay and that's good enough just one can of chickpeas and i've washed them off they're all drained okay nice one can i'm just gonna bring them over here and i'm gonna put them in this dish because i'm gonna grind them up from from here grind them and i use natural process yeah which is a masher a masher and i just grind you're doing the the monster mash yeah i love balls this is the most the most physical part of the whole procedure right you've got to hurt you've got to earn that hummus and then we have a little bit of uh yogurt to add if we need to oh we've got greek yogurt yeah let's add that we're gonna add the the mixture the uh and i'm just gonna add a little bit of greek yogurt just to give it a little bit more texture this is the final step after that we can put it into a container and start eating it look at that hummus guys yeah it's all uh it looks so good already there it is ready yeah here's my spoon oh wow yeah we normally have this with veggies or crackers or something but let's taste it let's taste it on its own it's got all the flavors all the flavors you want in there like you said it's way better than store bought there's no preservatives in that right no okay that's amazing and that's probably that's probably going to last us maybe up to a week huh oh yeah a few days for sure a few days for sure do you have a name for it pumpy's hummus yeah i call it uh puppy's homemade pumice i hope you enjoyed this uh this little section in the kitchen and we'll have definitely do some more stuff in the kitchen yeah and we're also going to do some stuff outside too okay great time for another healthy update from the jeffree household we're juicing what do you think we're going to have juice for lunch and uh it's a combination of veggies and fruit and um we just chop it up so that we can put it in the uh the juicer in the juicer and uh the juicer does the rest it comes out as juice and then we just top up the glasses sometimes we add a little chia seeds to it and uh it's a great way to use up the the produce in the fridge that's right yeah so when that when your fruit crisper gets uh and your veggie crisper gets a little bit too full then just start juicing now we're ready to juice the juice is plugged in you want to have as much mixture as you can you got fruits and vegetables there you dig down you try to get that looks like a nice fruit salad yeah yeah it does it does and you can have all of these things just by themselves you know like they're all really good to just to have by themselves but it's also nice to have juice every once in a while so thanks to my dad we're at the stage where we get to drink the juice okay yeah the juice is finished we had to actually pour it into another container because there was too much for the original container yeah and uh yeah we're ready for our platters and uh our juice we're gonna have a healthy lunch platter to go along with it so and like i say we have some chia seeds here to add to the juice for anybody who wants to add them and uh i know i will but okay let's pour it and try it okay okay i'll pick some too okay you'll take some yeah this will be uh a teaspoon the tea spoonful so i'm going to put in just a little bit in each so to start with next yeah look at all that foamy stuff eh oh that's that's called the cream the cream of the juice yep it's gonna be really good just to remind everybody what's in there there's a zucchini celery uh carrots ginger english cucumber as well the fruits that are in there are pineapple apples two different kinds of apples grapefruit oranges and i think that's it yeah that's awesome let's try it toast cheers cheers to juicing oh that's nice and citrusy and sweet the pineapple is you really taste them that's awesome it's so nice to be having juice especially on a hot summer day yum all right and those are the healthy juices this is something that we probably make once or twice a week yeah on average yeah maybe three times if we three times if we remember if we're ambitious so this has been a part of our healthy lifestyle this summer yeah we are at odell park in the heart of fredericton yes right in on the south side it's there's three or four blocks it takes up great spot it's the lungs of fredericton and it it's good in the summer it's equally good in the winter you know and the spring and the fall as well we've been snowshoeing here in the way yeah yeah we've actually and uh a lot of people go cross-country skiing in the winter what you'll find in the summer is a lot of walkers yeah a lot of joggers a lot a lot of picnickers too like right in the park yeah and in the fall like the colors are just amazing so yeah it's even better this is my new favorite place to exercise in all of fredericton oh yeah i used to walk more by the river this summer i've been gravitating towards here and so you've been shedding most of your weight on the on the bike trails on the bike trails yeah and i've been i've been shedding weight and blood here on the uh on this trail i had a wicked fall i got a big boo boo down here oh yeah that's still uh recovering you know i'm not going to give you a zoom shot of that it's gross no no yeah anyways this is one other thing that we've been doing to help us uh yeah sort of change our lifestyle a little bit this summer and uh you've been doing more walking than normal yeah i've been doing more walking you've been here about four or five times now at least yeah yeah yeah which is great which is great to get me out that many times yeah there's a there's so many different options here like there's so many different trails you can take once you're in the park yeah and so yeah this has been one of our this has been my primary way of shedding weight in terms of exercising you can go up and down you can switch back all the way through the park like that and if you're if you're on a bike you can do the same thing you know exactly it's great so uh an all seasons park and we've been making the most of it love breathing in that fresh forest air yes the oxygen when you're right in the middle of the park you don't even realize you're in the city it's great it's awesome totally awesome well it is high time for an update isn't it yes it's been a long time it's been way too long yeah anyways we just stopped here in queens park which is just uh a couple of stone throws away from the condo and i just want to show you what's going on here we got two baseball games going on they're both slow pitch sometimes there's the kids are here and they're playing hardball the pool is just over there the pool's not no longer being used because it's too late in september yeah and then there's two courts here one is i i don't even know know the name of that uh what they're playing right now some kind of a pattern it's kind of like kind of like paddle ball or whatever yeah and tennis behind and of course is the tennis courts behind us here so this is a great facility and yeah we just i just wanted to stop here and just show you what's going on i'm gonna join you for a second so there's a reason we've got our helmets on we're going for a bike ride today we're going for a bike ride and uh this has been your primary exercise exactly during this weight loss challenge and you're gonna take us on one of your favorite routes today right right and we got fall colors it's amazing the weather's beautiful we're you know we're dressed in basically just shirts you've got a little vest on a little less any time any time you get a day that's close to 20 degrees after uh the 21st of september it's a bonus day big time big time bonus great time the colors have started to change and uh sam and i are just about to our goal when we get there we're gonna have a little celebration that might be uh within a week from now and so we're both really excited about it it's been a great summer we both inspired each other to lose weight we've done some activities that helped us along the way but uh you know it's it's been really really a lot of fun just just just trying to achieve what what we wanted to achieve so it's awesome and i would encourage anybody to do what we did it's it's fun but it's also worthwhile too cheers congratulations george thank you thank you this time it's gonna stay on i hope so yeah it will well guys we are back in the kitchen it is time for us to make some more food and one of the food items that we've been having a lot that's really helped us to stay healthy and also to lose weight has been has been salads salads yeah yeah and uh it's a good way to increase your uh volume of veggies and yeah you know like some of the special ingredients we're gonna add today are our shrimp shrimpies yeah we've got shrimp we've got feta is that right yeah we're going to put in different kinds of nuts walnuts this is going to be like an extra special salad dried fruit we have ginger zest we have chocolate find carrots avocados as well oh it's gonna be amazing when you have all that that many nice ingredients you know it's gonna taste good it's gonna be good yeah well the we're not gonna put too much lettuce in no no that's that's always a bad salad right this is that's for the rabbits anyways um so my dad is gonna handle making the salad so we'll show you some of the preparation and i'm gonna focus on the dressing and what i'm gonna put in the dressing i can't wait to make this one it's gonna have maple syrup balsamic vinegar extra virgin olive oil and a little bit of dijon mustard and i'm going to add a little a little bit of garlic finely chopped and maybe he's also talked about ginger too and ginger's that's just gonna be zesty we've also got a beautiful argentine wine to accompany our lunch so this is going to be an extra special lunch this is the salad will take a little while for us to prepare but we can't wait to show you the process and then we're also going to sit down and show you what it looks like when we're having plated yeah so here is the wine that we're going to be having today a classic one from argentina one of my favorites fincas las moras reserve and it's a malbec of course 2018. that was on sale too so wow yeah and we're gonna get a little fancy here we don't normally do this but we're gonna decant it yeah we're gonna let it breathe for maybe 20-30 minutes okay and it'll be perfect for our lunch and our supper tonight whenever you get to have a nice argentine reserve wine we take we take our opportunity to have it awesome yeah awesome awesome i've got all the ingredients i need maple syrup i've got extra virgin olive oil i've got oh sorry for this chopping board balsamic vinegar and last but not least some mustard so basically i'm just going to be experimenting with the ratios i haven't made this dressing very often in the past and yeah i'm just going to put it in like a tablespoon of each a little bit less mustard and then just modify it according to that the salad is coming along beautifully huh yeah you've done all the chopping of the veggies all the uh all the veggies are washed and rinsed and ready to go into the salad yeah now all we have to do is get all the rest of the stuff ready and then we'll cook the shrimp and we'll top it with shrimp it's gonna break and put on a few uh walnuts yeah we got some cashews as well yeah and you've also you've uh sliced some uh the prunes and the dried dry prunes are already that was a really nice addition yeah just adding a little bit of feta sprinkle feta oh yeah what guys what doesn't taste good with that right oh i see as we go all the way along i love the nice big chunks of avocado like that and here goes the shrimp this shrimp this shrimp top it with the shrimp oh guys i i we went a little bit overboard in the shrimp we used the whole package you don't have to use a whole bag we need our protein right guys the maple syrup is going to be a really nice addition also any time you put balsamic vinegar and olive oil too it's just that it's looks great we are ready to eat okay let's dig in lunch is ready i'll take care of the wine how about you serve the salad okay oh yeah malbec reserve from argentina and delicious salad from my tomato my dad so i think the key with salads what makes a good salad is the ingredients right it's what it's all about well most people don't um don't spend enough imagination on their salad you know yeah i mean you can there's so many things you can add to a salad to make it good yeah and uh you know i mean you can just have the plain veggie salad fine but i mean if you add seafood if you add avocado if you have nuts if you have fried fruit gonna dig in grab a piece with shrimpy oh salad dressing it's good i eat this at a restaurant that's not good what do you think yeah so that was we got a double portion out of that that was amazing that was great well cheers let's have some dessert some more wine oh i love the dark chocolate too mm-hmm i didn't i didn't used to like this 75 this is actually 85. this is super 35 miles this is this one's not as sweet but perfect pairing with wine that was our lunch and i guess our biggest tip for making a salad is to be creative right yeah use your experimentation use your imaginations you don't there's no bounds on it yeah and not just for the salad but also the dressing too yeah anyways cheers to you cheers uh good luck with your uh any weight loss program you're you're currently in and exactly or that you wish to uh dive into later and guys sneak peek next up we're

rocks into the water not amazing for catching fish when you do that no i literally just had no interest in it it wasn't ready wasn't ready i wasn't ready i didn't have the interest but this time i ordered us a rod on amazon you haven't fished in a few decades and so you're gonna be basically this was one of your first passions yeah in life fishing right yeah growing up when i was growing up as a boy i used to miss school as soon as the ice came off the river i'd be down fishing and my mom would give me an excuse saying uh you know oh george george had a tummy ache today george had a headache well the ultimate gone fishing though yeah i was gone fishing yeah you were gone fishing no matter what a bad day of fishing is way better than a a day at school or a day at work it's better oh of course yeah a hundred times out of a hundred yeah so we're gonna do a little fishing here we're dressed up in our fishing gear fishing garb and we got our fishing garb on and uh i can't wait to learn how to cast today so we're not actually we don't care if we catch anything we're just out here to have fun and we're trying out this brand new rod it's like a pretty nice little yeah it's a collapsible rod fishing 101 with george here with okay salamander sam so if you were if you were a first-time fisher how would you do the casting here okay you pull the the bale open okay hold on to the line just with your finger okay and then you can stand back up a little bit here take the the rod and let it go right there nice and easy yeah and then you start reeling it in it's not very deep right here but there we go nice if that feels better oh that wasn't bad yeah good good one that was a good one that was your best one that's my best one there you go this one two finishing on a high note yeah it's it's the uh cheers cheers father-son weight loss challenge completed and now we're enjoying a local beer pickaroon's man's best friend yeah and uh you know we couldn't be happier we couldn't be happier just think about this challenge that we set for each other we thought now would be a great summer to improve our health yeah to lose some weight but to do it slowly and responsibly over a period of time we weren't trying to to drop like 20 or 30 pounds in a month we gave ourselves all of the summer and even a little bit into the fall three months yeah basically just over roughly about three months a little bit a little bit under three months yeah i'd say about 80 days yeah and we also took time off when we went to gram and end yeah we went to nova scotia we gorged i went to nova scotia on a work project and i absolutely gorge so it even showed that like even with a little bit of some setbacks yeah we could still do it because we jumped off and jumped off the rails for a while yeah got it right back on cheers and i gotta hand it to you if i was the hair in this race where i was trying to always cheat a little bit in terms of like putting in extra exercise and doing this and that trying to drop a little bit more you were like the studio and you ended up i i mean i hit my 25 pound challenge but you lost almost 35 almost 35 pounds yeah well since june 12th yeah just i'm i'm a a fraction of a pound less than 35. 211 pounds to 177. that's unbelievable so i like it it's really inspired me seeing you do something like that and i think it's amazing because you're telling me that this is the lowest weight you've been in 50 years probably 50 years yeah something like that and uh it wasn't that hard it really wasn't that hard all i had to do was start fasting from supper yeah all the way to breakfast with nothing in between i'd say except for three or four days yeah i did that and uh you know you were remarkably disciplined there were a couple cheat nights we had as a family and we we got into the chips we got into the licorice the chocolate and i didn't and you didn't i didn't participate so you had you had your very very unusual thing but you showed tremendous commitment and discipline to the project and uh i'm really i was really impressed by that and now uh because of this we're wearing different clothes like i'm back into a size 32 i get a 30 you're you're in a 30 like i have four i gave you my my shorts that were too tight for me when i started this challenge yeah and now you're you fit into them yeah like to be a 34 inch waist for me 38 to a 34 yeah that's amazing one short summer i went from uh i went from a 36 down to a 32 when i came back from argentina i was even heavier so i officially started this challenge at 190 but when i came back from argentina earlier this year in january i was 200 yeah i was 200 pounds so i'm down i mean i'm down considerably and now the phase that i'm in is that i i want to defend this weight i want to keep it yeah and i want to keep it and i think what i have to do from here on in is i'd like to lose a little bit more but i i want to add flexibility yeah i want to gain a little bit of muscle mass back and uh tone it yeah and make sure that you know that i'm a little bit stronger than what i am right now like i'm just a bag of bones like compared to what i was before you know well the thing is when when you're doing challenges like this it's just phase one yeah you've got phase two three three yeah and so yeah it'll be what we've what we're actually going to be doing to keep ourselves accountable is we've created a google spreadsheet a google document where we have the entire calendar for the whole year where we can weigh in daily uh there's a section for for dad and sam so we can't cheat yeah well you know what we're gonna do if we're like going up five pounds or something i'm gonna send a little message on facebook and be like wow those are some nice snacks you're eating at night or how about how about those those christmas dinners or whatever yeah but you know the message that we want to save i mean i'm i'm 69 years old yeah you're 38 38 yeah and almost 39. we can and you know a lot of people say well it's really really hard to lose weight when you get to my age well yeah it is but you know if you got a program you got something that works yeah you can do it and it's really the the other the other message i want to say if we can do it anybody can do it yeah i agree i couldn't agree more because we i mean we're two guys that love our food we love to eat both of us are the types of people we can we can eat people under the table we can eat people under the table if you go if you rewind the clock like 20 years ago over 20 years ago we used to be the types of guys that could eat a family-sized pizza each each and we did i remember we used to order it when we used to live in gold river we used to order two for one pizzas on a friday night one for you and one for me and then we we would still have room for ice cream and cookies later on in the evening i mean our appetites are enormous like we can really put away the food and what we did though was we committed to being disciplined we committed to the system and uh i i found your program especially good because you gave yourself a little bit of fruit in the morning yeah and then we had the healthy lunch platters and healthy supper the kitchen cover closed after supper and day after day after day just to bring it back a little further to rewind it a little bit further at age 50 i was 255 pounds okay and now at age 69 that's what 19 years later yeah i'm 177. so there you go wow i said that i have to get better now i have to lose i knew that you know that i shouldn't be 211 i knew that i should be around 180 or between 170 and 180 and so i said well how do i get there well i know how to get there you know i just got to stop the snacking at night yeah some of the fasting the fasting was the key fasting was the key last thing was the key because uh you know you you stop eating uh and you really don't need anything more after that you know you've had enough that's great so we did we did just what a lot of people also call time-restricted eating we were basically on a 16-8 ratio we were eating within an eight to nine hour window yeah and we were fasting 15 to 16 hours on an average day and we found it easy because we would have supper at five and usually we go to bed at ten or eleven so maybe the most willpower we probably had was around nine or ten at night yeah but then you're so close to going to bed that if you've made it that far in the day you know you've lost weight you know you've had a really good day nutrition-wise health-wise it's easy i found it personally for me i found it easily easy at that time of night to just be like you know what i feel like i could eat a snack but i'm just not going to another another little helpful tip right after supper brush your teeth and that tells you that there's no more food going on game over at night came over after that okay yeah yeah i mean i think the other aspect that we haven't talked about that made this work for us was that we turned this into a challenge yeah we it's good to have some like a person a person to challenge you yeah it's good it's good to and and you know like we helped each other yeah and uh you know we lifted up each other and we uh we exactly right because we had a couple roadblocks like one of them was we came back from grand manan the trip where we went for five or six days and we we put on like seven or eight pounds yeah we did but we got right back on the program and within like a week to ten days we not only lost that but we were at our lowest weights at that particular point in time yeah when you go to grandma you don't have to gain that much weight we indulged we really indulged while we were there and then uh and we thoroughly enjoyed it yeah it was a it was a good break you know and uh thank you grandma nan it was awesome yeah we had to go back there yeah anytime any time yeah and and also i i mean if if you thought you indulged in grandma then what i did in nova scotia was even more yeah yeah you saw the video of our halifax guy that's gonna be on our other channel samuel and audrey audrey and i just went to town with the food and it was a culinary based work project so the expectation was that we were gonna eat and for those two weeks i just said you know what forget it forget the protocol i'm just gonna enjoy and don't yeah i didn't want to feel um restricted by that by that particular project and halifax restaurant scene is unbelievable compared to fredericton okay oh come on fredericton's pretty good federation's pretty good but halifax halifax steps up yeah but halifax is a bigger city yeah so yeah anyways yeah that concludes our weight loss challenge and here's to you here's two years to you all anybody that tries to do

We have super cool We're the only ones here Sam neglected to tell me the waitresses and they connected me while I'm rambling Our camera was awesome many of you carrying on like a pearl She brought us something called vinyl and I believe some kind of sheep's cheese with like looks like bacon So I'm just gonna try it on bread. I'm not entirely sure how But you know bread and cheese seems like a pretty good idea so let's go for it Oh innocent. Thank you It's a do thank sheeps cheese. And this looks like some kind of beginning It's time to try it I feel like I could eat this on its own I don't even have to present sci-fi tonic films Good stuff that's good. First time hiring this Sam with the fancy water wheel re right behind Henry behind me. Alright Alright time to try this Battles gonna a big bite it's kind of like divided into layers like over here you have the cheese and then you have the egg and then Sprinkled bacon bit so I tried to get a bit of everything on here Yeah, well I go plunger the bacon us. Mm-hmm It's really like that's the first thing I taste them and then all the cheese is really nice salty cheese Yeah with the a got it kind of reminds me a bit like a premium omelet or something All right, and we also ordered wine and we got a bread basket And yeah, usually I found when you order bread baskets here in the Train and you get both brown and white bread Yeah, well, but you know what miss Nikki means what we pointed out the cheaper price for the wine turns out it's only 50 Ml. Oh, yeah That's really small. Haven't even touched it yet. We need like half a liter. Yeah. Yeah. This is a taste Well, we do in all fairness. We do have to do a lot of filming today. Yeah, so Anyways, we yeah, we got a Cabernet it's made from the Ukraine and will serve the wine from the Ukraine apparently comes from Odessa Mm-hmm, so I'm guessing this make me from Odessa Yeah, also the really popular wines that you can order at restaurants in the Train included Georgia and we'll go be in wine Yeah, we decided to go for something super local made in the country Smells good It's pretty good, that's a decent. That's a decent dry red. Yeah. Yeah kinda has a charity taster Let's try the brown bed No butter so I'm just gonna take a bite Pretty good. No, I think I'll disaster that's nice. Just nice having it as a company like this. Mhm Work of art right here. I believe we've ordered something called dim sneaky and I need to I'm gonna break this baby. I can't actually lift the bread off. So we're gonna have to break it How do they do this It's like they cooked the bread over the ceramic bowl. Oh my gosh, it's Recovery's a totally talked out. Okay so now that we've managed to break all the bread off and then let's show you what's inside the Defaulting of the lens fogging of the lens so in here we've got some pork We have potato pancakes We have this like creamy sauce with dill and carrots and garlic and it all looks really really good That's going for some pancakes I've really been enjoying these like fried pancakes. Yeah, like, you know savory mushroom sauce is on top it tastes so good Yeah, we haven't shown them before in videos, but we've been eating them all just kind of our Ohana does it too much? So it's a lot Yeah, I mean it's piping hot it walked out the lander son Did though So creamy and yummy Yeah, my turn to try it fishing something out breaking off the potato sauce, oh my gosh, yeah, it's so hot I can feel the heat Feel that heat. There we go. Don't try writing with a little bit of bread first. I want to blow on it Good stuff. Nope is one of my favorite things to eat here in the Ukraine for sure, huh? Oh, yeah But I've now had it about three or four times into the dish now that whenever we go in order to like traditionally every name We had to stay but we have to get that one cake. This is so nice. What's that sauce? That makes it so moving on to the main the meat dish. What do you mean? Yes well this this meal is kind of the classic piece of us of our eyes being a little bit bigger than our stomachs because this is Huge this apparently is the host specialty. They actually have named his dish after the restaurant It's a seven figs and it is a huge pork leg It appears like they have like a cheese or some melted cheese melted cheese sauce, and I'm just gonna like car will be huge Look how big that It does it looks really tender so I'm gonna get some sauce on that taking each bite. Oh My gosh that looks nice to me So tender and actually it's not a cheese sauce, it's a mustard sauce. Oh, it's got a kick to it. Yeah Totally different than what I thought Gonna grab some meat. I also want to get a bit of the skin try to get some of the skin That's really nice sauce and make sure you get some of that mustard sauce, but a little bit of everything in one bite Oh my gosh. I know this looks messy but Dr. Green, right. I mean sighs reminds me a roast chicken where you keep the skin on it Good musically tender like you remind me of pulled pork a little bit. Yeah, that's that kind of texture The mustard, I mean it's got some kick but also We still have another dish and I'm never coming boy and we're we're kind of getting at the whole speed oh Boy And so another side dish we ordered is but any key which are the dumplings these ones are black Yeah, we though we haven't had this before it looks interesting. You have never tried to block dumplings All we know is that they're stuffed with pork and veal There you have it Nice it's quite good But we have no idea why they're black some do they make them blocks are the only box that I've had before is Winning yeah, good question Help us solve this mystery guys, did you know I mean if you know Sam doing it? They're quite dense yeah, there's typing ability of a heavy Oh Was it really different than the one who tried before yeah also had like potato and cheese ones. Mm-hmm Well, this is I can just entirely mean we've done the art denser for sure. Yeah, you know what these almost look like They've been seeing instead of oil. Yeah, I think they may have yeah one more. They're really good They remind me a little bit of gym stuff. I Was just thinking that yeah Tasty though. All we need is some soy sauce and a chopstick Well Mister this is like I think our Ukrainian style kinda cheesecake and it's got like a chocolate topping and I think I've been able to see what might potentially be dried pieces of fruit in the middle Yeah, I think I actually have one in a lightweight Raisins freezer I'm so good Because like this is just like pure cheesecake There isn't really like a bottom layer that's just appeared dense sticky cheesecake just the way I like it So I kind of feel at this point the meals sort of turning into a challenge a challenge meal and so forth There's like an endurance for it. I always have room for cheesecake though really to start ordering less of the problem. Mm-hmm Good then, huh? Could be dizzy. I wonder if those raisins have been so good rum soaked raisins Taste a little something-something The Sofie All right, mr. Foodie it is time for dinner When in Kiev there's one dish after death for sure that being chicken Kiev So yeah reporters this that we've ordered a whole bunch of other different things And we're just waiting for it to come and it's always that exciting moment because I'm hungry and I can't wait to try it But in the meantime, but they brought up I forgot about that First up vodka. Yeah Our first drink of the night red wine coming Oh Wow, you just downed it in one shot alright gonna go Yeah, that's that's got an infusion of some sort. It's kind of like a lemony taste. Yeah, but it's very strong She can imagine Yeah, a little kick start the evening the right to tell us so the Complimentary appetizer is basically it's brown bread Pretty darn good, I think it's a one fighter They said that like I suppose this means Delicious kind of like free food, right All right, so I 2m kick-starting the evening with some Ukrainian vodka the first I've had in the country and even here along Strong isn't it? I'm just doing a little sip. That's all I can handle About a site from vodka. They also brought us free bread Bread, you know I said, no. Thank you But what's even cooler? Yeah So I thought this was butter, but no, this is a salty cheese and then I thought this was butter, but no Apparently it's pork fat like garlic and some chives Yeah Indeed. I'm gonna start with the cheese. It's read of it Okay, then we'll move on to pork fat and see looks like I know this looks like pork fat going on Our quota pork fat in Garlic is it so garlic you cheese bread. It's good notice quite nice job And goes well with the vodka but now Let's try pork fat I don't think I've ever smeared pork on a piece of bread before But our waitress was telling us this is super Ukrainian. So yeah We're gonna do it But like thicker than butter the girl is butters, yeah, it really cooks your mouth That's fascinating. That's not bad. That's cool. We're trying some new venture. Yeah So now that we've had some vodka we're moving on to the wine has arrived and the cool thing about this point is that it's Ukrainian wine to dry red I really excited I try this because I did get to try the dessa dry red at a wine bar the other I don't have a lot of experience with the training wines. I've tried a lot more like George. Yeah Good Good all right Just keeps showing up so I think just a pickled herrings. Yeah, so I ordered some pickled herring for us Yeah, coz but I think boiled potatoes. Yeah, and also some pickled onion Cove onion So there yes, I will try that Yeah, we figured we haven't tried a whole lot of cold Ukranian appetizer Vicious violaceous. Yeah, so flavor wrong. Yeah. I love it. I love that. I think this may I've cleaned up being her favorite dish This is setting a very high standard to begin with all right, I'm gonna grab a little bit of everything So let's grab half a potato. Yeah half a piece of fish Some onion and get these flavors all mixing together labour explosion I Love that. I absolutely nice salty herring That's a really smooth fish it is for something that is a pickle that's surprising and juicy to Purchase pancakes, this is our cream. Yes, this is very good. Okay. Thank you So, what do you think of the wine I'm really starting to get into the dry wines. Yeah, joy, you're Reds, especially We have another dish we can hardly keep up with all the fans showing up at our table Come on, I ordered some potato pancakes fried potato pancakes. We're gonna add a little bit of sour cream there. I Love the sour cream and Ukraine. Yeah, such a nice addition to like the dumplings to the Just anything we've really tried it on the building. Yeah, you know what I've also been enjoying just ordering a whole bunch of little appetizers instead of big means. Yes that we can sample That's really nice it's kind of like a grated potatoes I kind of shaped into a pancake and fried So it's like nice and golden a little bit crispy from here, but still like soft and oily in the middle so Sounds like my kind of pancake That's in La Mancha down So the main has arrived this is what you came here to star of the meal Chicken Kiev. Hey guys, it just looks like art look at this. It makes it looks like You know, it looks like it comes on a stick. It's actually chicken breast. Look, I think it looks like a chicken leg Just decoration. It's okay. This is basically ready chicken inside Sometimes it can be stuffed. This is every every restaurant is a different way of preparing. Oh my gosh. Look at that. Oh, It's stuffed with some good goodness Great. Yeah usually has something like butter inside You know what? The easiest way for me folks in it is to actually just try Juicy oh my All right, let's turn You're right it does have like a poverty kind of texture and sauce in the middle And then the outside Outside is it's really like delicious. It's if that's the threaded part of the chicken Yeah reminds me a little bit like a new NASA that we tried chicken Milanesa, I was it reminds me oddly enough of something that my mom used to make It was like kind of like she can bake with pork chops or with chicken So it's got a really nice coating on the outside and then the chicken itself is really tender and flavorful and quite juicy, too I must say It's awesome. Like it is chicken. Oh Here we go trying my chicken kid in Kiev for the First chicken Kiev. Yeah. Wait, is this my first? Yes it is. I haven't ordered this before. Oh my gosh it is so Buttery and juicing. Oh, oh my god. Just seeping out the meats. Just breaking apart like everywhere Maybe one last good super juicy in there. Yeah We ordered this with a side of fried potatoes Yeah and onions. Yeah, and we've also got some onions zucchini is good my shows on the bottom, baby, right? I think that's the caramelized onions is so a mushroom Oh, yeah, I think I was like so that was like one of the extra things they had It's oh wow a lot going on. They're Going Please do Chicken Kevin's good. Yeah chicken Kiev in Kiev OMG dessert has arrived We are we arrived we ordered Confetti Miki Which are these little dumplings and we got surprise so I know we ordered the cherry pine and the other one's kind of a surprise Yeah, this is technically dessert ooo and to go along with it, we have a sour cream with a little bit of jam Yeah, turn the other way oh This might be cheese, okay, maybe salty cottage cheese Sweet Jesus we teeth. I would have been a little weird Today combination. Yeah, it's gonna say that would be a perfect combination YUM, nice way to finish off the meal I'd say Oh, it's time for price point. I was 560 and local currency just under 22 US dollars. All right Brazilian value eleven dollars per person. We feasted we Really ate a lot there's a lot of food just a lot of wine there's a lot of Appetizer on me a lot of free Blanca just growl free bread. She's a lot of everything What a creep or crap any of those. That's just an awesome Ukrainian meal I've been really enjoying the opinion from in here. Yeah, and actually we are leaving tomorrow this a little bit sad So this is our officially our last dinner here in Kiev Exactly Wow, oh wow, that looks beautiful So we're diving straight into another Ukrainian food video as you can see the food's already at the table, so we're going to get rolling here But yeah, red restaurant called openness Which is Sam discovered by chance when he was walking around the game yesterday In fact, yeah So it's located in the middle of a park and also the restaurant is like built around this giant tree Like right now, we're on the second floor and the tree trunk is yes there. Yeah. It's a pretty cool setting it feels very Rustic, very traditional. We actually came here for dinner last night and they had live music Accordions we were like we need to come back for those and here we are at like 11:00 in the morning eating lunch Anyways, you're probably wondering what this is for my appetizer I ordered a mushroom soup mushroom soup with dumplings and it said it came with bread crust So I was like alright They're probably gonna bring me some bread or maybe there's gonna be some bread crust like floating on the soup So there's my soup and if I kind of touch the bread It's starting to get a little soft because we've been taking so many pictures here We are so I should probably dig in before it starts like seeping through the bread But yeah, if you have a closer look in here, look at this, it looks so good Real mushrooms in there some carrot. There's dill a nice broth. I'm so excited for this. I skipped breakfast purposely for Ukrainian food Nice that is good, we've got some really nice fresh mushrooms in there just looks so good. Look at that rich Vegetables and yeah, this is crazy like a few days ago We knew nothing about Ukrainian food and we've just been trying everything we can and we're enjoying it so much It's all like really hearty filling food So yeah, this is delicious Alright, so I'm just gonna break a piece off my lid So I'm pretty sure it's for dipping. This is nice and toasted. It's like nice and buttery la la This is a really fun meal. All right, so I am having a Ukrainian salad here and it's pretty special It's got feel that has goat cheese. It has zucchini. You can see that it has some Tomatoes here. I'm just gonna like mushroom Yeah, there's mushrooms. Oh, wow, looks so good. Any company a honey mustard glaze. Yes, it looks beautiful So I'm gonna try bitten me a little bit of cheese and How about some tomato? That's a nice big way? What do you want you lost I stole them yeah. Oh That is like an amazing salad you could actually you die. I was the kind of a mean it's not good Mm-hmm, and it's good. Oh, it's just so flavorful. I love the I love the dressing Mmm, it's just delicious So what are you holding in your hand? So here is what I call a big sexy mug of beer Is a proper pint and I'm trying the local one. It is l'viv Ski 1715 so so that was probably crumbs. Remember the bead and one would assume one would assume It's a nice beer. Yeah, we've been doing a lot of walking this morning. So I feel like I've earned it Okay, and we almost entirely forgot about your drink what do you have a drink isn't as exciting I'm not having the local beer or anything, but I am having a forest berries juice. So How is that it's good but who wants to hear about juice when my main has arrived I Ordered cabbage rolls and yeah these come stuffed with rice beef Pork I forget the other ingredient onions onion lift that up first Oh what I've kind of destroyed it, but there it is Looks good, then we go These are still steaming oh my gosh Ah Good, uh-huh Wow a little heart ripped on ya. Yes. She did just bring it to us That's really rich and savory and they're kind of like floating in a broth almost like borscht and I had some sour cream and dill on top So yeah, we've got some really nice flavors happening here It's like dangling. It's dangling. I Don't know. How do I eat cabbage rolls out of the bowl? This is super super tasty, I would really recommend this dish I think it's one of my favorites that we've tried so far Sam's main is here. This looks so good Yeah, so when she was bringing it over it was actually there's actually still flaming a little bit on fire. Yeah We didn't capture that unfortunately It's beautifully presented here So this is duck brisket and it appears to be cranberry sauce and then some some caramelized orange Yeah, some caramelized oranges on the phone. I'm so glad I got Try that so I'm mixing it with cranberry sauce so good No It's amazing. It reminds me of like like turkey dinner when they're mixing in turkey with the Cranberry sauce is so delicious so delicious And it's um, it's a very it it's tender but it's also like at the same time It's a little bit of it's more chewy meat. So that's not for you very rich and flavorful though very delicious Time for the one thing we've been neglecting We were brought a bread basket a little while ago and this this is really nice looking brown bread. Like look at this has like seeds on the outside Yeah, maybe even cranberry. Mmm, even the butter looks like quite Yeah dill maybe garlicky butter has gone on there Read-a-thon, oh Yeah time for the first bite Brilliant It's just a type of bread I could make a whole meal out of it But we've still got dessert So don't last but not least it is time for dessert and I'm not gonna lie That's probably nothing Ukrainian about the dish. We ordered apple strudel. Yes this Is amazing so good. It's a 20-minute wait, but yes the best way Yes, and this is a dessert that's recommended by all the waiters and waitresses here and we go fresh out of the oven with ice cream and caramel and icing sugar Good stuff It's not amazing. It's So good. I'm already done my hop, I feel so good that you dare touch away time to wrap things up here so the price of that meal was 770 which is 30 US dollars and that's definitely the biggest splurge we've had here. Oh my gosh. It was wonderful Everything was delicious here and we did to get some decadent things like duck And then we also had dessert and tea at the end and beer and everything So yeah, it was totally worth it highly highly recommend this place This place is wonderful the food The quality is just outstanding but we're also gonna be making some videos where we show you guys how cheap yet really is. Yes Yeah, highlighting some affordable meals not just glared available. That's true Good day from a chilly summer day here in Kiev. It is lunchtime. And today we are going in search of food What are we gonna have we're gonna be having a whole bunch of different Ukrainian dishes. Yeah. This is a Kazim We're not too familiar with not at all So we're just hoping to order a whole bunch of different things and try most of them for the first time Alright guys, so we've made it inside the restaurant This place is called Katyusha and we were actually here yesterday and we ordered so much food, and it was really good So we decided to come back and show you guys what Ukrainian food is all about So we've gone all out once again today and we've ordered like four different mains and dessert and drinks. Yeah this is gonna be a fun little introduction to Ukrainian food for Both us and you guys watching because this is basically our first time you know Getting acquainted with Ukrainian dishes. So should be tasty. Sam is loving the vibe This restaurant is so cool. It's like stuck in a time warp. I mean, it's got so many different retro things going on Yeah Well TVs two old videogame consoles and just like the paintings the wall hangings and the different decorations in the restaurant It's kind of a fabulous place. I have to say yeah, it kind of looks like the 70s but with lots of antiques Yes. Yeah, very has a very 70s 80s never feel Okay, so first up we are starting with import Which is a sour soup This is one of those traditional dishes that you've got to try here in the Ukraine Now the original recipe calls for beetroot But I think we've somehow managed to order the cabbage 1 so it's lacking that distinct like purpley red color This one's a bit more orange instead Lots of shredded cabbage in there looks we've got potatoes a little bit of meat some dill which I've mixed in So yeah, this is really tasty. I love soup's on sour stuff isn't great for me Especially on a little bit of a chilly day. Yeah, just so chilly up. So I love to be having some soup All right my time to try work but before I even do that over here, we have some it comes with bread two little bread rolls and We had these s videos so I know what this is. So this is like a little container of sour cream Yeah and in here it's kind of like a buttery oily garlicky mix probably could be like Boil until I'm not sure about the garlic in there. No Yeah, yeah. Okay. So I'm gonna try the bread dunk it in this one And then have a bit of a divorce It's really good. There's a big piece of meat. Oh, yeah, I Also remember reading that you can add the the sour cream to your borscht hmm. You can actually just put it in your soup That's like a really good idea. Yeah. Oh my gosh that meat so tender just melts in your mouth. I know this is Let's experiment. Alright, let's actually try that then Come up just like top Right in it's gonna stir it in a bit This time I'm gonna go for more of a cabbage potato bite Oh, yeah, there's way better with the sour cream yeah Oh way better. I'm a prude Sam approved So Sam here once this fellas yeah. I wanted to try the I think it's called oliviere Oliver salad Yeah, Olivia and it's just a very it's very visible to you can see exactly what's in it. Yeah well you've got like eggs and carrots and peas and I think little cubes of ham and It looks like it's kind of like an in a type of a mayonnaise type of sauce time to try that All right, and he goes for a bite Kinda reminds me a bit of like, um A potato salad or something like the kind of salads that you would have a like in Canada. It's most similar to that Yeah, but it's also really good cuz it's got like more ingredients in a typical potato salad. Yeah Yeah, I do very much like it. I like that It's uh, yeah, it's it's it's it's a bit of a richer salad. Obviously more of a high-calorie one We all know my boy needs those calories, right Yeah, I am for plate number three have a look So for this one We got potato pancakes and yesterday we tried zucchini pancakes which were green and they were really tasty But we figured potato ones are probably a bit more traditional Yeah that sour cream on Yeah, these are nice little size you can probably order them as appetizers or as a side dish So they look like they've been pan-fried Yeah, and you can actually see if you look at the texture I mean I've kind of made a mess of it, but it's like shredded potato with like yeah Delsin looks really good. He really I made a mess of it. Oh It was quite nice messy og, hmm nice on a cold day you Could just melt some cheese all over this. Is it is it more crispy or mushy? it-it's more mushy Yeah, it doesn't really have a crispy exterior like those Korean pancakes. We used to hum. This is definitely more mushy and oiling Good In he goes there I go Woodsen. He prefer the potato ones are the zucchini ones requestion your question. Oh Yeah, you can really see the potato. Yeah, I have the stringiness of it What kind of grease we aren't there yeah Clogging Yeah, I think I think on a cold day I prefer the potato ones They're a little more they have a little more substance to them. I'd say Yeah, these are nice Moving on to our fourth dish we believe this is called the body making you or about any key Yeah, we're not entirely sure and having just traveled in Poland. These are Luxurious it was borrowed. Yeah, it's look awfully familiar. It's cool how there's like there's a lot of regional similarities between the cuisines In Eastern Europe it even has the caramelized onions on top it does Yeah, and I think the ones the ones that we ordered these dumplings have Mushrooms and cabbage cabbage. So let's try them. They're definitely a little smaller than the ones we had They're more bite-sized What do you reckon so good? Oh my gosh, I love I love any kind of dumpling they're really tasty Um, yeah, these ones are the they've got that kind of that grease the exterior, which is really nice But then when you bite into it, the filling is is really tasted like oh my gosh It's so good and I just love how you have the the onions on top as well. So good I'm going in for another one. You know, what else we notice on the menu, you can actually order these dumplings baked. Mm-hmm So you can have it boiled or baked. Let's write a never separate name for the big ones to forget what it is well, yeah, you can get them differently done and we go so yeah, these are definitely Just kind of like miniature bite-size feel like I could just be snacking on it and you know watching television popping them in I Know I could eat like I could think they have like 20 of these if I was hungry, that's not nice. They are very good. Mm-hmm How'd you like the fillings? I do. Yeah, I purposely ordered them Mushroom ones because when I had those in Poland, I just loved them I think Poland still leads the way with pierogi, but this is an interesting variation So yeah, definitely enjoying it still going strong time for dessert Voila, do we believe this is called mega. Boop if we've deciphered the menu correctly and if you take a closer look it basically looks like a whole bunch of like little pancakes stacked on top of each other with the layers of cream between I'm done you Wrong Decadent is this quite nice. I feel like I've had something similar before and I can't remember where Where did we eat a cake? Like maybe maybe maybe? Lately in Kyrgyzstan and yeah, it was an artist man. Yeah for dessert. I think it was called a honey cake Yes, and I've had all these layers and just honey and cream in between it's really tasty What's on top though? Still trying to figure this out looks like some kind of nut it comes with hb2 I think this could be like ground-up nuts. It's really really nice. No ice cream Really good stop time for me to try it. I feel like you've had like half the key already. There isn't a whole lot How many voices you not before me? Try some with ice cream Isn't it might as one delicious pigs. Mm-hmm I can tell it this place specializes in desserts because when you walk up the stairs, there's big like display of all the cakes Oh, yeah. Yeah, they're they're really pointing out all the different cakes that you can have when you come for lunch or dinner here Yeah, so just wrapping up a delicious meal. Yeah This is including dessert. Yeah, we ate a lot. We definitely definitely you know what and it was all really good It's just like I'm glad that we ordered a whole bunch of different things We tried to tried to kind of order an eclectic mix and I think that we we accomplished that for sure so the bill has arrived it comes in this cute little bucket so time to do the conversion assess the damage assess the damage going to my exceed con So basically this came to Ukranian Souvenir can't even see the currency properly guys Are you you age? That would be 13 US Dollars and 71 cents, so that's a little lot considering we had The knowledge and that was like we each got our own salad too Yeah, so it was even more dishes than what we had expected. Awesome You want to see right? Carry my currency my sunglasses case That's how I roll. That's how you roll. Anyway, it's nice affordable meal here in Ukraine and delicious Ukrainian food. Absolutely Alright guys, so it is breakfast time here in l'viv and we've ended up at the coolest cafe ever It seemed like a post office and check it out. There's basically mail boxes everywhere. Yeah, lots of postcards You have the little like envelope feeders on the doors Like it's so so cool. So yeah, we're gonna head in have a bite of food and then go sightseeing All right, so we're inside the cafe our food orders have been placed Cappuccinos have arrived in this place is super cool We weren't even planning to come here because technically this place specializes in pastas and beers But the one cafe we had walked into first was totally packed. Yeah, we just like wandered and here by chance We saw they had a little breakfast section. I mean the place looks so cool. They're like, yeah, let's see here. Exactly So let's try that Okay, and while you're trying that something to keep in mind while travelling in the train is that we've noticed in both? Yeah And now Aviv that if like if those are really popular restaurant and you just show up like on the weekend you need a reservation Possible, yeah. Yeah if you really want to eat out of place it's better to make the reservation in advance Yeah, if it's not has happened to us several times I'd say that's the third time that's happened. Yeah. Yep And how's that kept it you know? Tasty So a few thoughts on Ukrainian front Yeah, so when we were kind of researching a role like what it was a typical breakfast in the Ukraine It didn't seem to be like an exact standard Yeah You could have something like borscht that could be like dumplings. But we've already shown that in some other videos Yeah, we decided to just come and have like more of a contemporary breakfast and temporary contemporary you creating breakfast But anyways, it should be really good like I'm excited about what's coming and this is my first sip of the cappuccino No Need my coffee in the morning, this is your third cup, come on, let's admit it. Thank you Yeah, I wired for sound today guys Oh My goodness the food is here. This is so busy. This is so much more beautiful than I was expecting So we're right in front of me I got these crepes with apple and walnuts And just look at the way these like folded them and like twirl them like it's so pretty and it has cottage cheese as well I see sugar cinnamon like this is origin apart. I almost don't want to dig into it This breakfast we are hungry. It looks like a little flower. Oh, wow, Joe slim. It shows the middle in the middle. Oh So it looks like Oh berries. Oh my cup. This one was Apple, but maybe we got berries Wonderful. Does it matter? I mean the other one the other maybe Apple then yeah. Yeah because the other one has a Has a cinnamon whatever small So good Tasty I have to say we have a bit of a sweet tooth this morning both of us ordered sweet breakfasts So nice with this like cottage cheese and all the icing sugar and cinnamon mixing together man Got to love it Okay, it looks like a mix of almonds apples beer shows all that's in there It's kind of hard to see I mean it all looks kind of like mush. Okay, just trust my taste buds here Good stuff I did not it's something that's really cool too that we just noticed. Is it this middling sleeves? Yeah, and it has a nice amount of like icing sugar and just yeah, it's just so beautiful. It really is a work of art Really is where I work out, right? Like these are the nicest crepes I've ever had in terms of presentation Like seriously, that was such a beautiful plate I Taste something that's a little bit similar to like a cottage cheese as well. Yeah. Yeah, that's the sauce. Yeah. No, it's awesome denieth It's really good. Oh, man, it gives it a bit of a Salty complement to the to the sugary Ness of this. Oh My god, oh my gosh Then we have a lot more to drive and time for the next dish. Yeah, the next dish is a stack of little pancakes here Dusted with icing sugar if you look down it's got Raspberries it has a lot of cinnamon which I'm really smelling and enjoying and Apparently this is going to be a sour cream based sauce. So yeah, it's gonna take one off here Those pancakes are nice and fluffy. Oh, yeah, they really are good. Nice and fluffy. Take it for a swim. Grab a berry. Oh Yeah No, it was awesome Those are like I just love I love anything with a lot of cinnamon and it's sweet But it's also tart with the berry and a little bit sour with the sour cream sauce So you have a lot of flavors competing. It's wonderful. Your teachers are being entertained here Yeah very much so early in the morning. So this is yeah I thought we were getting something a bit more sweet this morning But it's nice to have the tartness and sour as well because those are flavors. I really enjoy doing In the background, yeah, you mean the music it's been good at so yeah, very classic to like American cowboy Wow It almost reminds me a bit of Lacombe with a Greek yogurt no, yeah, yeah Yeah. Oh, that's a good way of describing it actually. Hmm just Really? Thanks. Yeah, I think they're so fluffy. I mean This is a nice surprise. I mean, I know we could have had borscht or dumplings for breakfast This is a nice change sexy that we've done a lot of the the typical Ukrainian dishes, you know, exactly Yeah I mean like parties having breakfast in two different countries is realizing that Like there isn't often always a standard like people with people basically whatever they are in the mood for And breakfast changes from like a weekday to a weekend We can spare them. Yeah feel like on a weekend. You're more likely to experiment. So yeah So this this was all Sam searing because apparently bakes and crepes were not enough. He wanted something else That was sweet and our service suggested this particular dessert. So it kind of looks like what is it like deep fried dough may be? coated in like sugar cinnamon and it comes with a little Little sauce Bowl here. Yeah, let's is all about A lot. This is like a nice clean even illa custard again. Super sweet This is good, I mean, there's no way I can eat all of this but No problem so my turn to try and you can see this but these are absolutely coated in icing sugar and cinnamon beautiful Donkey I'm eating arts meeting her It's not custard that really makes up yeah and then the first place your first white Cinnamon really hits you. Mm-hmm, and then the costume Yeah, it's just really nice. Oh my gosh, this is that this is a wonderful breakfast, but it's so much food That's turning one more into a brunch. I know and if you would have expected this from a post-office feed cafe I know. Yeah, the specializes in fasting crap here. Yeah. You also do a nice breakfast guys If you have a sweet tooth come here for sure and time for the doodle time for the bill This is what it came in. Oh, cool I I kind of struggled to open the box Our little gift inside the receipt, yeah. So anyways that came to what just over 200 yeah I was 207 207 to be exact which is just slightly under eight US Dollars and To route to conclude that was for two cappuccinos. Yeah, and three basically manias Breakfast means you had the the crispy fried cookies. Yeah in cakes the crepes and oh boy. Yes. Yeah Oh my gosh for a full So you can't he can't find too much better value for a for four dollars per person. Really? Can you see I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a nice breakfast Sam why are you not walking in the safety of this tunnel? So It is lunchtime here in Kiev we've been here in the city for about a week and today we've decided to take you for georgian food because we've noticed Georgian Kuzon is super popular in the city There's actually this one street where there's like a whole bunch of georgia and restaurants right next to each other So we figured what is this popular? We need to make a food video So yeah, we're on our way for lunch. And this is how you cross busy streets in Kiev through underpasses So there is lots of climbing and descending stairs Sam is a man on a mission Marching towards the georgian restaurant. No one is going to get between him and his food stomp stomp stomp So, what do we know about George insane well, we've never actually traveled to Georgia at least not yet So we're not that familiar with this food. Although we did visit this restaurant a few days ago, and it was so good That was like we have to come back over But what we do know is that georgian cuisine is a mix of European and Middle Eastern Influences, so all should be very exciting. All right So the first thing has arrived and that is my Georgian red wine It is a sapper AVI Which is a dry red wine which comes from soporific grapes and I had this last time and it's so good and when they asked me like do you want to smoke a Big glass of them Finnick make it big and be very black things Look at all. All right. So at this restaurant you get some free appetizers. So we've got a nice little mix of breads Cucumbers this little bowl with like coarse salt and spices and you also get four little dipping sauces So we've had these before these two are really hot, especially the green peppers Yes, and then we've got some beetroot and I believe this cheese. Yeah, it's like kind of similar to like a cream cheese consistency Let's go for the spicy one, though This could be trouble Inspiring and then Amen then you've got the cucumbers which are nice and refreshing cking dip this right into his soul from the spice Yeah Big Mike That good Okay, it's time for the first if yes, so ordered a Georgian solid here, man It's as basic ingredients It's just tomatoes cucumbers and onions and you can see all those quite clearly And it comes with a kind of a nutty bass dress Yeah, so let's try that. So I read even speak compared to a Greek salad you - the feta Right soon I can do the comparison. Yeah The drudging is actually not strong. It has a bit of a nutty taste. Well, yeah, it is like The old ingredients are nice and fresh Tomatoes what's good so good to get that good to get some veggies in before the heavier dishes to come along. Yeah Time for the next course and I'm actually gonna have to read the name for this once it's a little complicated it's called by the DJ niggas eat and This is eggplant rolls with a walnut paste and it just looks beautiful Basically, they cook the walnut until it's soft and then they roll it up with a walnut paste that also have spices and vinegar They also put a little dollop on top put some pomegranate seeds. And yeah, it's Beautiful. It's art its arts on my face are gon play and it's so good I already tried this one last time we came to this restaurant That we were like, yeah, we're ordering this again Let's say, yeah, I just love the will not pitch enough and there is more food Coming faster than we can use So yeah, the walnut piece it almost has like a like a who was Ted sir, but with like a really strong nutty flavor So it's really really good. I would really recommend trying this dish. It's one of my favorites Next next dishes here. Yes the next dishes here It is like khachapuri and it comes with some gooey cheese, which is similar to mozzarella Basically, if you take a look over here this kind of looks like a like a Georgian pizza it has been cut sliced like one with sliced in and in my Little triangles and my gosh is never cheesy. We had this last time too It's kind of like a salty to you And this one comes with double to you. So actually there's very definitely and it's very filling. It's very dense So, yeah, if you're looking to get filled up eating Georgian food You'll definitely want to order this with one of your dishes edit it will it will make you feel stuff for sure Yeah, and I think we're going to be taking some of it. Yes. Definitely. We made the mistake of being the whole thing last time By the time dessert rolled around we've I kind of already done So next up we are trying that dolma, which if you have a look over here It's basically like a grape leaf that has been stuffed with minced beef Rice some spices and it comes with this white sauce It almost looks like I don't know some yogurt or sour cream based sauce, really? Yeah, and this I'm actually trying to the first time sauce I'm screwed Does the creep please give it a bit of a sour taste? Er, no, you know? The leaves are quite soft. I was expecting them to be a little tougher They're really good So, I'm really curious to try this one as well I haven't had it before so Yeah, they just look through like that's the way the food is presented at this front of restaurant is beautiful click oh, yeah, really liking of our I also like that. These are bite-size. Yeah Mm-hmm. Oh my gosh That's so good so juicy. What's the first thing that comes to my mind and you really do taste the meat inside as well? but you're right though, the Belief is very soft. Yeah, it's much softer than I thought I thought it might have more of and this kind of a like a leathery texture, but you got it alone. That's very soft Just bite right into it. And for dessert like I don't even have room for dessert. What's still going strong? Apparently how we ordered a sampler plate that has four different Georgian desserts So I don't know the names of these individually, so I'm just gonna read them, right? Back Tony No, Bagheera Gianni. Yes pastilla kozinaki and baked cookies with Bella mushi and Custard so I think I can probably identify it the cookies but the other three are a bit of a mystery All right, but I'm gonna start with this one because I've had this before And it's good. It was my fork. My fort has vanished Steve's my dirty form Here's a clean one. There you go So, let's go like this So this is really nice in some restaurants, I've actually seen this called like a Napoleon or Napolitan or something like that and it's basically all these layers like pancake layers with cream in between Oh my good That's probably your favorite favorite dessert that I've had here yeah so much so I'm going in You're ensuring that a custard is so nice And each other once you do one more and then I'll have it here this one This one's a bit of a mystery to me, I don't know what the exterior is I keep thinking It's like a big paste of sorts maybe but I'm not entirely sure And then inside it's just more custard more cream the same kind This is returning this for the first time we did or does anything All right, so I'm going to try the other two so I'm going down here for the walnuts and they're basic It's basically like walnuts and kind of like a syrupy honey type consistency. It looks like there's some icing sugar on top Whoa, look at that. Let's see the trail stickiness and You always devour that dessert I love absolutely love not so It's just right up my alley this sweetness like them but this year open and thickness added to it really makes it nice Mm-hmm All right And the last one for us to try here And we're gonna have a bit of the dissection going on is the cookies and then yeah as I'm opening it up here it's basically like a cookie shell yeah and stuff the inside of that is Appears to be like kind of like something of the jam right consistency Yeah, and there's also a custard right next year if you open right the other one. Okay, I'll do that for this - yeah We can make a Spanish He's gonna try one for now, yeah the thing that surprised me about these for me when we had it Last time was that I thought the I thought the cookie shelf would be more soft But it's actually kind of like it's a hard and crumbly Yeah, so I don't know what the ingredients are for that one But to me, it tastes a bit like almost like an almond cookie. Yeah. Yeah, I would agree. Yeah Yeah, just the texture of it when you're biting. It. It does remind me of an almond cookie. Oh That's really good. That's also one of my favorites Um, it's cool that like these two are my favorites and I think these two are your favorites So yeah, it works out it works out very well So this is our receipt it comes in a little envelope sealed in the back And actually last time we came here the lady handed us this letter and she's like before you go Here's the letter from Mama monogamy was a restaurant. I was like, oh Like they give you a little letter All right, so time to assess the damage it came to 819 which is 31 US dollars. So just over 15 dollars per person And yeah, that's a bit of a splurge milling CF and we ordered so much food And I don't know if you can see this, but we are taking a big walk home I couldn't even finish a we were defeated by it by the meal it was that good So I hope this gives you a bit of an idea of different types of story and food You can try basically different things. You can eat serves a Georgian cuisine. We really liked it I really love this restaurant highly recommended if you're visiting Yep, Creon. And yeah, if you get a chance to try Georgian cuisine definitely do so. I don't think you'll be disappointed at all All righty, what is happening today, oh my gosh today is a special day we haven't had Korean food in ages Ages we were actually wracking our brain and thinking like when was the last time and we believe it it was in Pokhara Nepal Months months ago that's half a year ago. So we came to Kiev and cut we're kind of here for a little while We actually researched online to see if there was any Korean restaurants have been craving it for ages and we found one There's actually one that's quite highly rated. It is a view dog I don't want that up there and you know, what's so funny for a second I thought Sam had finally learned how to read Cyrillic. Oh right. Now I was reading the Korean Yeah, and then of course that was the typical Korean sign and as well beside it - alright, let's go anyways we're hungry Let's go in. Let's eat Korean food. So excited Okay orders have been placed and I don't think they're gonna be very many surprises We have our favorites we tend to work on the same things over and over again But we do get six free little dishes side dishes on challenges Yeah, and there's other things that are authentic about this too The little bell when you're ready to order or you want to get more drinks to go ding ding ding and one thing well the Canadian I did order a little bit different that I normally Normally tend to get both slightly been bought if I haven't had it for a while, but I ended up getting kimchi bokumbap which is against my right race and Yeah, we ordered men do as well. No, we got the patch on then Imagi, right? Okay, so you're missing a little bit Yeah, and I got soondubu jjigae, which is what I always get I smell your lovely. My tofu stew is you know, it's it's late August here. It's getting a little bit chilly get up So yeah, yeah barely is under 20 most days Surfeit has arrived all at once but we're gonna start out with the band shun. So we got lots of free dishes We've got our sweet potato here Looks like sweet potato, right? Yeah, I think it is. In fact, it's either Oh Kumar comment on this mom go come on. It has been quitted. Oh, thanks. It's almost like a pancake form. Yeah We got our pickled radishes. Yep over here. I've already had a few Anderson spicy So good this one looks a little familiar, what is this Let's try it anyway Hmm it might be some kind of mushroom. Oh, wow, that's good That's what its gonna guess and then we have the bean sprouts of course bean sprouts and they go Those are so tasty. And of course we have kimchi Oh See we go. See you agree. Let's not forget. I will see you in don't thinking green. That's Kim That's what I'm starting to forget. Where's The drawing don't worry Amy cheeks To the we do have the we do have the classic kimchi. Mmm-hmm. I mean know what This kimchi has some kick I've already been having some Sneaking in through the wall oven filling and what's the last one to the left of it Oh Spicy end of your food time. That's like a spicy given this also looks like kimchi It looks like like it cooked for a little bit. Let's see. Yeah have some onions in here as well. Yeah. I'm T onions Is it warm? No, it's called otis cold. Okay, I mean not sweet sauce. Okay. It's a sweeter kind but similar What is the name No Sweet red sauce like why you seem sweet that you add to your BB pot au feu chocolates. Good to joke. Good job It's got lots it goes to John. Oh Yeah, that's red pepper paste starting to get my runny nose it always because whenever I have Korean QW I know we love it, but we haven't had in so long I guess we're just we're not we're not quite used to the spices again That was like when we first came back to Korea again last year Oh my gosh virtually dating some digestive issues for the make it we got used to it Yeah. Okay. What are you gonna to look exciting? We've got Pat Young which is like Korean pancakes and his beautiful it's already it's been sliced up, but it only choked on this so I'm gonna slice it further once for Yeah, so the main ingredient of course is the pop which is the green onion Italian and then then Actually, this is kind of like a mole project because it's got I can see that there's seafood in here No, it's got red pepper and with that probably onions and other just kind of assorted seafood All right. So let's take that for a swim here. I believe this is kang gyeongmo sauce It's like a soy sauce mixed with the vinegar. It should be really nice success, right? Yeah Oh, yeah a little bit of chili powder you yeah, you have to absolutely dump here You have to dunk your pageant into this doesn't taste good. It's good. Otherwise Yeah, very authentic amazing look That's what you can tell that it's being served basically as a main dish As opposed to just like BAM champ as if they make it nice and thick Your turn go I'm just gonna dunk it properly dunk. Oh yeah, yeah My favorite we arrived really hungry today We were actually gonna come breakfast we skip breakfast and we were gonna come around 11:00 And we ended up having a super long Skype call and now we're here at 2 p.m yeah, we Brother appetites for sure. It's really authentic. I don't so authentic And no I mean what's a viewer time for the mean I ordered that gives you book goof-off Which is kimchi fried rice. Yeah, man, man, this this looks it looks so good I can tell that there's chunks of meat in and already it's got lots of kimchi. It has other vegetables already Yeah, and the kicker is a the emitted super authentic by giving us a runny egg. Yes. That is how you finish That's how you that's basically how you played how you talk? kimchi fried rice and Sam can't deal with runny eggs unless You're if it's me, it's just funny. Right? I like it. I Have really weird like the foods that I don't like I have really weird conditioners for them Yeah, they get just runny eggs on their own But they mix it with rice Totally totally fun. So let's see. How is this? That's good, yeah it's very Compared to a lot of other gyms people come buffs I found it's got quite a bit more sweetness do it with dolls. Also have a lot of space. Oh, man Really does so you've got like very intense sweetness Which you kind of kind of hit you right away, but then as you're swallowing them it's more intense to spice and yeah It's very spicy My throat's on fire. So a Little soup. All right, maybe like Karen goofy like um, um a little egg Egg soup not entirely sure Looks like egg whites and some spring onions. Yeah, that's exactly what it is. Yeah, and that's that's kind of mr Cooper cooling your palate a little bit. This is a spicy. All right. Yeah Because shanks Kerry Feel like we see that a lot. Your nerves are very cheesy lines. We seem to have a long Hot that's hot. Hmm. Let know spice it up. It's just hot hot hot you know what I mean about the sweetness, uh-huh it hits you hard, but then this place Yum, it is sweeter than any other book another con. What? I'm everything the one we had was it in Nepal that one the sweetness was just wrong because you're not putting ketchup in there And this is this is my authentic Yeah, I've had since I've had seen some kind of sweeter kimchi bokumbap in Korea But it tends not to be that way tends not to be as sweet as this All right, still kinda with the presentation and the spiciness and the other ingredients are definitely on on part Yeah, try I like it. It's different but I like you. Yeah, but it's definitely got a little bit more sugar than Than what we're used to Try this was wrong Yeah It's just nice for cooling up a little bit. It's very very late I'll say yeah I've got a nice mild flavor. So she need a little bit of a break from the spice exactly This is really good so far Let's move on to your dig a are you really? I sure AM. So for my main, I ordered the soondubu jegging which is the tofu stew it also comes Comes with a bowl of rice and done white rice, that's a very authentic care invisible and this too I have to say it looks it looks a little bit different from what I'm used to like It's what is really no, it's not as red. There's very little broth. It's mostly all Tofu, and I'm used to it being like the soft tofu lay there were chunks But this one looks a bit more realer. It was an egg already mixed it in. Yeah It looks like there's some meat Which is unusual in the studio. I'm so touchy. Sometimes. Did you get me into the booth? But sometimes not Spray-z It tastes quite eggy like an egg drop soup okay tofu and a little bit of spice it's not overly spicy I prefer you know that rich breads crazy broth right makes your eyes rod makes your nose run Everything's watering. So it seems to me that the tofu is a little bit different normally It'd be more than that the silken tofu. That looks more. Yeah, more like a curdled I would say yeah Yeah, it's different. It is a bit different but it does taste good. I am not complaining Okay, Sam. Let's see what you think What's the night you know, no it tastes it tastes to me more like a doing junk jiggy Like I saw you being a chicken but um, it is good though. It is good. Yeah Yeah, but I think that they made it as a doing something to get to be honest tell It is tasty though, yeah Honestly, this restaurant has been such a pleasant surprise. We were not expecting to find amazing Korean food Very happy but this right here is our happy place No, no, we're just gonna come on tight guys. No more filming. Just enjoying those so much food So much. Yeah, we did a pretty good job. I think vision of the means polished off the means But yeah, we are done defeated time it is time to ding-dong-dang the ding-dong Well, well, what a beautiful waiter in the meal they brought complimentary water Nolan which I think might pursue Correct me if I wrong in that pumpkin no whole part this pumpkin. Okay, because a Saturday Yeah, anyways, so it came to 491 which was nineteen US dollars Yeah, I found that was great value because we got three main dishes We got tons of banchan tongues aside to just forgot to show you I had Georgia Hawaiian man And we also got a big thing of tea to share. So yeah, that's pretty good I mean some people ignite something a person to have a really nice authentic Korean meal here in the Ukraine Yeah, I was lost them.

In fact, when you think of the best street food in all of Asia Taiwan may very well reign supreme. And if you are looking to sample some of the best Taiwanese street food you'll want to head to the myriad night markets of Taipei. Taipei street food is as diverse as anything you'll encounter. In the mood for savoury? Sweet? Salty? Sour? You'll find it all. Come join us for our Taiwanese street food guide as we visit three of the best night markets in Taipei to eat all of the Taiwanese street food we can gobble up. Now let's get started! Alright, so it has been a few hours since we last ate and tonight we're going out for Taiwanese street food (台灣街頭食品). So we're heading to the Shilin Night Market (士林夜市) and we're going to take the MRT to get there. Let's go eat. Sam may be feeling a little bit hangry right now. Just a little bit hangry. Let's ask to be sure. Hey Sam? What? How hangry are you on a level from one to ten? I think I've burst through ten. I'm eleven. So to get to the Shilin Night Market (士林夜市) you want to take the red line to Jiantan Station (劍潭站) and then take exit 1. So we have just arrived at the Shilin Night Market (士林夜市) and it is still quite early. It is 4:30 PM. Most of the stalls start opening closer to five o'clock and things will only continue to get busier as the night goes on. And apparently this market can run until like one or two in the morning. So yeah, still very early. We were hungry so we couldn't wait any longer. So we are having some kind of Barbecue roll with green onion (黑胡椒豬肉卷) in it. Okay so we are having our first snack of the night. And if you have a look over here it is basically a pork roll and it is filled with green onions and she also asked us if we wanted it spicy so she put some powder over it. Of course we said yes. Yes. Haha. Always. So look at that. Oh that looks good. Mmmm. Oh man. Do you like that? That is really nice. Yeah. I'm so hungry right now. What does it taste like because I've never had anything like this before? Well, have a look at it here. It is filled with green onions. That is like the main ingredient in the middle. So you taste both the pork and the green onions. Okay, so Sam's going in. Time for me to try it. Mmmm. That is really good. I like that the green onions give it like a bit of juiciness. Yeah. Yeah. And the pork is a little bit salty but it is not too as spicy as I thought it would be. Yeah. And we paid the equivalent of five dollars for this. It was a bit expensive. A little bit pricy but I mean. It was 150 Taiwanese Dollars. So yeah. But it is good. So there is one drink I've been wanting to try ever since we got to Taipei (臺北市). I love bubble tea (珍珠奶茶) and apparently it originated here so voila. Look at that. Look at that. I got one with brown sugar so you can see me mixing it. You can see the brown sugar. So good. On the sides and then you can see the like the pearl tapioca jellies at the bottom. Man, that looks good. Oh man. Oh man. Mmmmm. Real deal? That is so amazing. I love this drink so so much. Is it nice and sweet? Mmmm. What can you taste? Don't want to choke on the tapioca balls but it is almost syrupy. The brown sugar. Like it is quite thick. So you really get that flavor coming through and I love that it is made with milk because apparently you can just get straight up tea and I was like no no no let's go with the classic. Give me some milk here. The milk in there. So yeah, it is so good. So good. So Sam just had to get a taste of it as well. Of course. I'm sharing. Sharing is caring. So how much was this one? Mmmm. Okay, before I talk about that I just have to say how good and sweet that is. Yeah. You really taste the brown sugar. Oh man. And then you get sucking up all of the jellies. Man, that is good. Okay so that was 50 Taiwan dollars which is about a dollar fifty US. So yeah that is a nice affordable cheap drink. And so worth it. So worth it. And you know what else is cool. They give you a really thick straw so you can get at your bubbles. Yep. Exactly. Suck them bubbles. So for our next Taiwanese street snack we are having Taiwan fried chicken (鹹酥雞) and this was quite the process. Like first he took the chicken breaded it, deep-fried it and then he took a pan and added the sauce. We got sweet chili and then pan-fried the chicken even further in the glaze. And are those rice cakes beside it? These look like these could be little rice cakes. Yeah. Oh wow. And then on top of that he sprinkled peanuts and sesame seeds. It looks amazing. Yeah. And that was one hundred and ten Taiwanese dollars so you're looking at about three US bucks for that. A little bit more. A little more than three US. How is that? Mmmm. Oh my gosh. Good? It is so tender but so juicy at the same time. How about the sauce? Sweet. So sweet. Which is really good. So this was Sam's pick tonight. And I think you're going to be very pleased. I think I will. Oh that is so good. Isn't it? Like you said really tender. Yeah. And I love the combination of nuts and sesame seeds on the outside. Yeah. It gives it a crunch. Yeah. Mmmm. Perfect combination. And it is a bit spicy too. So if I can offer one piece of advice when visiting this market it would be to come a little bit later in the evening. We arrived around four thirty and it was you know pretty quiet. Things are starting to pickup a little bit but our food options have been a little bit limited because people are just you know showing up and opening their stalls. So later in the evening is best. Thank you. So Sam is leading the way with this one. What are we having next? Alright moment of truth. We've been playing it kind of tame. Playing it kind of safe so far. We're going right in to the classic Taiwanese street food (台湾街头食品) here. We are having Stinky Tofu (臭豆腐). Oh my. And it is funny because we saw this tofu stand and we're like is this stinky or not we don't know. So I walk up to it and I go. Sniff. Oh yeah. That is the real deal. That is stinky. That is definitely the real stuff. So if you've never tried this before I was reading on wikipedia earlier this afternoon that it smells something like stinky feet or garbage. Rotting garbage. Oh my. So yeah it is strong. I'm going to go take a bite here. Yeah. I think there is some cabbage. You can see it is on a double skewer here. Yeah, a double skewers and it has got cabbage in the middle. Somewhat like a sandwich. Oh my. A little overpowering there. That is something else. Oh. It is spicy. Um. Oh man. I'm keeping my distance. It is just you really taste the sourness of it. And the fermented aspect and woah. That is something that would take a while to get used to. I don't think I'm ever going to enjoy this one to be honest. How about a second bite to. Alright I'll do one more. I'll do one more. Maybe it'll grow on you. I also kind of want you to eat most of it so I will have very little left for myself. So just go ahead. Oh. Go ahead. That is something. I don't even know how to describe it because I've never had anything quite like it before. So. Wow. That is fascinating. How much did it cost? That was only forty five. So just over a dollar. About a dollar thirty or a dollar forty for that. So it is cheap. And you should try it if you're in Taipei (臺北市). Why not right? Yep. And did I mention that scooters come zipping around out of nowhere. Okay. So after stinky tofu (臭豆腐) comes the reward. Although that being said I don't deserve a reward because I didn't try the tofu. But we decided to get something sweet instead. This is for you Sam. I'm going to sample it for you to make sure it is okay. So we got a crepe (蛋餅) with oreo ice cream, Nutella, banana, whipped cream, chocolate powder. Yeah, it was the whole process of making it was pretty fancy. Mmmm. How is that? Mmmm. Sweet tooth cravings fulfilled? Haha. You're speechless. That is how I know it is good. For your bravery. You are being awarded an ice cream. This is my reward here. Which I've sampled for you. Hey don't make out with the ice cream. Mmmm. I'm still going to have some more. Oh I'm going to be making out with the ice cream some more. Hey! Sam! That is so mean. It is all over your lips too. That is so good. So decadent. I mean I just got on the second bite a lot of Nutella and like woah. With the ice cream and whipped cream and then the light fluffiness of the crepe. Man, I haven't even. Oh yeah it is a good dessert. I haven't had Nutella yet. That is a nice Taiwanese dessert here. So we've already had dessert but we thought 'hey' there is always room for one more. Dessert just keeps rolling. And this is definitely the most colorful thing we've seen out here at the Shilin Night Market (士林夜市) so far. So apparently if you can see here. These are pieces of strawberry that have been put on a skewer and these are candied (糖葫蘆) or called a toffee kind of fruit. Yeah. And you also notice sweet tomatoes and also plums as well. Yeah. We decided to go with strawberry. Yeah. So let's try that here. I'm going to try eating a whole one. Oh my. Oh wow. It is like properly hard on the outside. Mmmm. Okay. Oh wow. Mmmm. That is like a super quenching. That is like a super crunchy sweet glaze on the outside. Mmmm. And the fruit extra juicy on the inside. Is it warm fruit? It is. You can tell it has been like warmed up. Cooked up a little bit. Yeah. It kind of tastes like if you've ever had strawberry shortcake the way the strawberries are kind of a little bit warm like that. Oh yeah. Being placed next to a cake. Look at that color. It is so good. Ruby red. We forgot to take a picture. Mmmm. And you know what? A tomato snuck into the mix. Look. Are you serious? Strawberry, strawberry, tomato. Where is the tomato? The little one. Oh wow. Ah. You've gotta bite hard. Yep. Yep. Oh, look. It is seeping all over the place. Hahaha. Whoopsies. Oh my gosh. So what do you think? I'm making a mess on someone's storefront. Do you like it? Yeah, it is good. But we better run off now. So that is a wrap from Shilin Night Market (士林夜市). We really enjoyed eating all of the different Taiwanese street food (臺灣菜) and we're going to be eating up at a lot more night markets here in Taipei (臺北市) so stay tuned for that. Greetings from Taipei, Taiwan. Another day and another night market. And we brought our appetite. Today we are visiting the Raohe Night Market (饒河夜市) and they are renown for their street food. If you want to have street food this is the one market you need to visit. And earlier this week we visited Shilin market (士林夜市) where we got to try a few different treats. Yeah. But we're on the lookout for more Taiwanese street food (Xiaochi - 小吃). It is all about the food tonight. Let's go eat. Okay so we found our first snack of the night. Before we even entered the market. Yeah, so we're trying a pork bun (胡椒餅) that was cooked in the oven. And this is just freshly made so really exciting. It is like pipping hot. I can feel it warm in my hands. And it was cooked in what resembled like one of those Indian tandoori ovens where the bread just sticks to the side. That is really good. And this is filled with pork and chives. So I'm not getting a lot of pork on the first bite but it is very thick and condensed. So very doughy. Let's see if we can get a better look. Alright, so we've finally made it to the point where I can get some meat here. Alright. Mmmm. Bite number two. Oh yeah. Nice big piece of pork. A big piece of pork. What? Is it ground pork? It is ground pork. It is ground pork. Mmmm. The pork is a little bit sweet and also a little bit spicy. But the dough is savory and salty. It is a nice contrast. It tastes really good. And it was also really cheap. It was only fifty Taiwan dollars which is I think about a dollar fifty. A little bit more than a dollar fifty US. So Sam got the giant pork bun but they also have options for vegetarians in the form of mini-buns. So I'm going to try that one. Look at it. Yeah. Covered in sesame seeds. That was just stuffed at the bottom of our package. So pretty cool. There you go. It is just the chives. That is all that is in it. That is your vegetable. The chives. The green onions. Is it tasty? Really tasty. And I like that it is a small bite. And I like that is was a bonus. We didn't pay for it. Or I feel like we didn't pay for it. It was just like stuffed in the bottom of the bag. We like free things. What is next? Okay, next we're having something sweet so we stopped at Anna's egg tart (蛋撻). And these are like the miniature egg tarts (蛋撻) that you might find in Portugal or Hong Kong or Macau. Except these are like mini bites that you can just pop them right in. Yeah, you can pop them in. One each. Mmmm. How is that? That is really nice. It is like creamy and smooth and custardy. It is really good. I'll have this one too. Hey! Hahaha. That is so mean. I'm not sure this is going to be enough for Sam the giant. Show us that tiny little. Look at how small that is. These are really mini. When they said they were mini they weren't kidding. But I love these. Like you've said I've had them in Portugal, I've had them in Hong Kong. I've had them in Macau so really cool to try egg tarts here in Taiwan. Yeah. Big enough to fill a cavity, right Sam? Mmmm. Oh man. What do you think? That is really good. The thing I really like about it is that it is really creamy and sweet. I can tell that those are freshly made because it is still warm. Yeah. Mmmm. And they were so cheap. Flaky pastry. How much did we pay? They were only twenty each. So you're talking like just over a dollar US for us to both have. Maybe like a dollar twenty. Really really good. Nice little bite. But yeah that is not going to fill me up. Alright, let's keep moving. Red bean. Okay. (Speaking Chinese) And now it is time for a mystery sample that caught our eye but we have no idea what it is. We're being a little adventurous here. We have no idea what this is. It is cold in the hand. And it feels kind of slimy. And we got ten of these for thirty five Taiwan dollars so that is just over one US dollar. So let's just hop right in and try it. Um, I think I heard him say red bean. Yes, one of these are red bean. And this was sitting on ice. It looks like a dessert that was sitting on ice. Mmmm. Okay. Sweet. Yeah. The red beans obviously has some sugar added to it. And if I had to guess I think it is something the consistency is sort of like a rice cake on the outside. Do you think it is like a miniature mochi ball (麻糍 - 麻糬), maybe? It could be. It might be little mochi balls (麻糍 - 麻糬). Quality control. Quality control. Mmmm. Is it passing quality control? It is. I like it. It is kind of like a I would consider it to be a little bit more like a dessert than. It is definitely not savory. It is sweet. Good stuff. My hand is actually freezing holding this bag because it has chunks of ice in it. Um, but I'm going to try a different one. Sam was having the red bean. And this is another mystery one. It is yellow. I have no idea. The lady was trying to explain what it was but I don't get it. We didn't catch. We didn't catch it. Does it taste like anything familiar? No? It has like the texture of bean paste. Yeah. White bean paste? Is there such a thing as a white bean? Hahaha. I don't know. It is good though. It reminds me a lot of red bean paste just different color. But it is sweet. And it is cold. My hands are so cold right now. So this next snack was purchased solely for its cute factor. Let's take a look in the the bag. They're like these little egg waffles (雞蛋仔) or pancakes shaped like a cartoon. So here I've got Sponge Bob Square Pants. Let's see who else is in there. We've got this is like a Pokemon. That is a Pokemon. I don't really follow it. I have no idea. If you guys follow Pokemon tell us who it is. And if it a Pokemon. Hahaha. This looks like a cow with giant nostrils. No, that is panda bear. That is a panda bear. Anyways let's try it and see what it is like. A cow with giant nostrils. Nice. Oh how is that? Okay. So no filling whatsoever. But it is super light and fluffy and it has like pockets of air inside. Is it sweet? It is pretty nice. This would be good with ice cream. Oh, it is sweet. Oh yeah. It is like cake. Fluffy cake. Okay Sam, who will you be devouring tonight? So I'm going to bite in to Sponge Bob here. Sponge Bob. Square Pants. Those are really good. They're freshly made. That is what I'm loving about this night market so far. Everything we've had has been pipping hot. Freshly made. Gotta love that. And it was cheap too. So we paid forty five Taiwan dollars for this one. Which is less than one dollar and fifty cents US. So and we got five. We got five of them. Yeah. We'll be snacking on these for a while. Alright. Please put the whole cookie deep in your mouth and chew it. So what are you having Audrey? It is smoking. Smoking cookie. I have to put this whole thing in my mouth, chew with my teeth and not with my tongue. Alright. Woah! It is smoking out of your mouth. Haha. You look like a dragon. Haha. Is it good? It is cold. It is ice. Oh wow. It kind of gets stuck to your tongue. That is why they tell you to eat it with your teeth and eat it fast. Because it wants to get stuck to your tongue. So you probably just saw me try a smoking cookie. We also got some ice cream from the same place. This is called Smoking Molecule ice cream. I got the bubble tea (波霸奶茶) flavor and this is the bubble tea sauce in a syringe. An injection of it. An injection. Let me inject that. He said do it slowly. There we go. That looks good. And it has the pearls. This is bubble tea (波霸奶茶) which I love. Let's see is this going to make me smoke as well? Like this ice cream is super cold. It was so cold it was freezing. I don't know what they're putting into it. Let's try. Mmmm. How is that? Ha! It is not making me smoke. No smoke this time. No smoke this time but the ice cream is really good. It is dripping down the sides but it is tasty. Mmmmm. Yeah. That place was a lot of fun. It is kind of like a performance while they're making your food. Yeah, that is what I thought too. I thought it was just fascinating to see how it was made and just it is such a charismatic performance and a lot of attention to detail. A lot of fun. It is called Cooler Bear (酷樂熊). Yeah. Definitely check this one out. Yes. One of our coolest things yet. The sugar high continues. Yeah, we've had a really imbalanced ah ratio of sugary things versus savory things so I think after this we're going to have to hit up some savory stuff for sure. Yeah. Alright. Let's try that. And it is also starting to rain here at the market. Mmmm. So you can probably notice a few droplets on the camera. Oh that has got a nice really rich flavor. It almost it does taste like bubble tea (波霸奶茶) but it also tastes a bit like a coffee flavor to me as well. Yeah. Yeah. I noticed that too. Did you notice that too? Yeah. Mmmm. Love that. Love that stuff. Even the spoons are cute. They're shaped like little hearts. Yeah. This is one my favorites so far. Time to bring out the big guns. Yeah, so this is the one we've been trying to hunt down for a long time. This is fried chicken steak (大雞排) and it is so popular that there is like a order list. So we're just waiting for our number. We're 253 and the current order I think is 250 so we've got three more to wait for. Alright. Big meal for the big boy. What are you having next Sam? This is the chicken steak (大雞排) and this thing is a behemoth. Like look how big this is. And look how thick it is. I think it is fresh out of the fryer. It is pipping hot. Like it is actually too hot on my hands. I have to put the plastic bag around it. Yeah. Anyways, without further adieu let's try this. Oh and we got the chili version of it too. Yeah, the spicy one. Don't burn yourself on the wait. Woah. You can see the steam coming off. Oh my gosh that is good. Oh my gosh that is good. How was that chicken steak (大雞排)? Pure magic? Pure magic. It is so crispy on the outside. It tastes like the crunch and then you also taste the spiciness - the chili. But then the chicken is so thick and juicy on the inside. It is like that contrast between crunchiness and juiciness. And it is so good. I love this. I love this. Mmmm. So I don't know if you can see this right now but seriously check out the chicken. It is such a thick juicy cut. I know. You can just oh. There is so much more generous than what I thought. It is massive. You're going to like this. Oh. Hot? Mmmm. That is so good. The spicy coating on the exterior has got this crunch. It is almost like you're having chips. Like crisps. I know. It is so so good. And that is my favorite savory dish of the night so far. How about you? Yeah this is one of the best things we've had tonight. And the price was really reasonable. Sixty five Taiwanese dollars. So two dollars. Yeah. Two US bucks for that bad boy. This giant piece of meat. Like seriously that is really good value. Imagine going to a restaurant and getting this much meat. This much chicken. Amazing. It costs a lot more. Value for sure. So that is a wrap from the market for us. We're going to call it a night and head back. It has started pouring rain and it is basically just masses of people like bumping into each other with their umbrellas. So we're like okay probably time to call it quits. But we have lots of snacks that we're taking back with us. And oh gosh just as we were leaving we made the most horrible mistake. I wanted to order bubble tea (波霸奶茶) with milk and I got the original without milk so it is just black tea with tapioca balls. But I think there is brown sugar too. So it should be sweet. Yeah. But it is not what I wanted so I'm so disappointed. But anyways that was fun. We ate really well so I would definitely say this is a market worth checking out if you're in Taipei (臺北市). And yeah that was good. So if you want to check out this really cool night market in Taipei, Taiwan you're going to come to Songshan station (松山車站) and then you're going to take exit one and it basically takes you right there. You just walk for like a couple of minutes and you'll see the market right away. Yeah, and you turn left. There is a huge temple at the entrance. Yeah. So I mean you can't miss it seriously. Well good evening, good evening. Tonight the street food adventures continue and we are going to be eating at the Ningxia Night Market (寧夏夜市). So this is our third night market here in Taipei (臺北市) and I feel like there is still a lot of Taiwanese street food we haven't tried. So we're going to be on a mission to try a whole bunch of new stuff tonight. Let's check it out. And we've already found our first snack of the night. Tell us. Yeah, so if you look down here we are having a breaded cheese and shrimp stick apparently. Oh la lah. And there is a lot of Taiwanese seafood snacks that we haven't tried yet so we're just diving right in to that tonight on our third and final street food video here. Alright, so it is fresh out of the deep-fryer. And I must say that holding it in the hand I mean it looks really skinny and maybe a little flimsy but it is actually fairly substantial. Like there is a bit of weight to it in my hands. So I'm really excited to try this. Oh and they put some honey mustard on the outside. Yeah, they had a few different sauces. Like mayo and stuff. So we decided to go with that. Let's just try it. Oh, wow. Look at that cheese. Cheesy. Mmmm. That tastes quite a bit better than I thought it was going to. Um, really crunchy on the outside and then of course you get the gooey cheese. You can see it just like coming straight from the stick to my mouth. Alright, so time for me to try this. I didn't get any cheese. Have another bite. Oh you got lots of cheese on that one. Woah! Look at that. Gooey gooey cheese. My goodness. It is mozzarella. Yeah. So what do you think? It is good. It just tastes like breaded shrimp but I mean it is nothing fancy. This could be like frozen shrimp out of the freezer and into the deep fryer. Whatever. But yeah, it is a nice little snack. I'm hungry so I'm not complaining. So I'm really excited for this snack. I've tried it before and it has a few different names. I've heard it be called a Chinese style pizza (蔥油餅 - 葱油饼). Yeah, or green onion pancake (蔥油餅 - 葱油饼). Yeah, so and really it is neither a pancake nor a pizza. Um, it is kind of dark here so it is probably a little bit hard to see but I'll open this. I would compare it more to a roti. It is like this fluffy um flatbread. And look at that. You can see the green onions in it. Yeah, it has green onions and you can also get it with different fillings. You can get it with an omelet. Yeah, or you can get it with melted cheese. Yeah, we tried one with melted cheese a couple of days ago. When we were out on a little day trip and it was good. Oh man. How is that? This one has both. Oh really? Yeah. Oh, wow. This is really good. Lucky us. And it is really salty. Really greasy. Probably not the best for you but it tastes oh so good. So it is my turn. Let's give it a try. Woah. Let's not make out with it now. I bit in to the egg and the cheese part like right where the biggest amount was. So it kind of like urgh. Sprayed me in the lip. But that is really good. Mmmmm. I really like this and this is the kind of food that I could eat any time of day. I could have it for breakfast, lunch, dinner or as a snack. Yeah. And it is really cheap. We paid 35 Taiwan dollars. 35 so basically one US dollar. Just slightly more than a US dollar. So really good value and really cheap and we're enjoying this right here on the street. Alright, time to give it back. Give it back. So watching this next snack be prepared was quite the spectacle and a little bit scary. Ha, so if you look down here you can basically see that it is cubed meat (火焰骰子牛). And it was cooked by what I like to call the flame-thrower. Hahaha. Yeah. So he's like grilling it but at the same time he's using the torch to cook it faster. Yeah, exactly. And we've seen this at the other two night markets so this is something I've wanted to try and we're finally getting a chance to do it. So yeah, this is awesome. So I'm just going to take my little stick here. My massive toothpick and try it. Mmmm. That is really good. Yeah. Super juicy. I wouldn't call it tender. It is a bit of a fatty meat. Yeah. But lots of flavor. Don't choke on it. Pepper. The ground pepper is getting stuck in my throat. Oh man. But yeah it is really good. Really good. I'm losing my voice. Hahaha. Oh man, you sound like the Godfather. Okay, so time to try this. The meat was a little bit fatty so I'm like trying to be meticulous. Let's see which piece will be the best. Mmmmm. You like that? It is very juicy but like you mentioned it also a bit chewy. So yeah, it is not the softest meat (火焰骰子牛) but it is very flavorful. And I like that we chose a simple dressing. We just put black pepper and some sea salt so nothing fancy. Yeah because you can get something like teriyaki and other things. Oh and how much was that? This was a hundred Taiwanese dollars so just a little bit over three dollars. And this was a small portion. You can get bigger ones as well. So initial thoughts from this market it is a lot smaller from the two markets we visited earlier this week. Shilin (士林夜市) and Raohe (饒河夜市)) and this one is strictly food. It is probably just the length of one block pedestrian only and yeah it is just little stands selling food, no clothes, shoes or anything like that. If you want kids toys there is like a second block that continues behind us but there is no food there. So we're just sticking with street food for now. And when I say pedestrian only I mean that bicycles and motorcycles still get through somehow. I'm not sure why. Ni Hao. Papaya milk. Small or large? Small please. Okay, sixty. Sixty. Yep. Ah yes. Thank you. Thank you. Xie xie. Xie xie. So we've had a lot of savory treats so far so getting a little thirsty. So we noticed a place selling papaya milk so we're going to give that a try here. Papaya milk. I've never heard of that before. Oh. That is really good. Yeah? Really creamy. Is it milky or more fruity? Uh, it is about half and half. To be honest. You really taste the papaya. You really taste the milkiness of it. Um, I like that it is sweet but it doesn't seem like that added a lot of sugar or any at all. You taste the natural fruit flavor and the milk. It is not overwhelming amounts of sugar like say in a milkshake so I like that. It tastes more natural. One more. I like that. Alright, so packaging is pretty cute. We've got two little panda bears on top and they also had a lot of different flavors. They had like apple milk, avocado milk and like a whole bunch of other fruits so we went for papaya. This was Sam's decision. I'm not the biggest fan of papaya so we'll see. See if you actually like it or not? It is frothy. Yeah. It is almost like a milkshake. It is but it is not as sweet as a milk shake. Would you agree? Okay, that is not bad. I mean I still don't love papaya. You would have got a different flavor. I would have. Which one would you have got? If they had strawberry I would have had strawberry. But yeah, I like that it is very creamy and thick and frothy. That is one good thing about the drink. A different fruit would have made it better. This one was my pick. I saw they had baked potatoes. And I ordered the double cheese potato (王子起司馬鈴薯). So she put what looks kind of like a cheese whiz. Like a melted cheddar. Yeah, and then on top parmesan. And it looks like that might be oregano or some kind of spice. There is a lot of cheese going on. Yeah. And this is like steaming. It is pipping hot. Piping hot. Mmmm. Is it good? Yeah. Very cheesy. Very cheesy. It is nice. And you can also get it with other toppings. They had like ham and corn and whole bunch of other things to choose from. We went for the double cheese. We really like our cheese. Mmmmm. I really like this angle here because we've got a bearded red haired man right behind you. Check it out. Are you serious? Check the sign. Haha. My bearding abilities are not that good but I can eat well. I can eat well. So let's try this. *Cough sounds* We're both choking on the potato. I'm choking on the parmesan. Oh. Cough. Alright, we're good. We've both recovered. Mmmm. What do you think? That is really cheesy. Yeah. I mean it is not the best quality cheese (王子起司馬鈴薯) but it does the job. It does the job and I mean for the price point was it sixty Taiwan dollars. So less than two bucks and it makes a good snack on the street. So we are now ready to move on to dessert and we are having something called Coffin bread (府城棺材板) and I've been told this is a dessert that originated in Southern Taiwan in a particular city. Can't remember the name now. Um but it is called Coffin bread (府城棺材板) because the toast is carved into a little coffin and then it is filled. Look at that. And you can choose all sorts of fillings. We chose the tapioca pearls. Yeah because and brown sugar because we just can't get enough of that stuff. Haha. So yeah the toast was deep-fried and then afterwards they carved it. The preparation was fascinating. Yeah. Alright, let's give it a try. It is nice thick toast too. It is thick. But you know what? It is smaller than what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be like those giant square pieces of toast that are like super thick. So let's see. So what say you? It tastes like deep-fried dough. Hahaha. Do you taste the tapioca pearls and the brown sugar? Not quite the strong to be honest. It is mostly like the taste of the oil and deep-fried bread coming through. So. Not my favorite to be honest. It looks really cool on camera but flavor-wise it is not my favorite. Maybe with a different filling. I'm going to let you try it now. Let's see what you think. First impressions? What do your taste buds think? I feel kind of the same way you do. Yeah. I think it could use a little more of a stronger topping. Yeah but maybe more brown sugar. But the Coffin bread (府城棺材板) itself is good I would just like to see a different topping with a bit more sugar added. More sugar. That would also go good with ice cream too. Yeah, maybe icing sugar on top or like more brown sugar inside the coffin. Yeah because the tapioca, the pearls, it is just a little bit bland inside. Yeah, I do agree with you about that. Yeah, alright. Well, most of the food has been a hit so far tonight but sometimes you just can't win them all. So final thoughts from this market. We ate pretty well but in comparison to the other two we visited previously. Shilin (士林夜市) and Raohe (饒河夜市)) I would say this one has a little bit less variety to choose because it is smaller so I prefer the other two. What about you? But I feel like this one is a little bit more traditional so I quite like that. I think I like it a little bit more than you but it is the kind of place where you just come for the food and the experience and it is very busy so I think it was fun. I'd come back again but yeah if you go to the other two night markets which are bigger and a little more famous you do have more food options definitely. Alright, Mister give us instructions. How do we get there? So to get to this Taipei Night Market you're going to take the red line. You're going to get off at Shuanglian (雙連站). Take exit one, take a left. You're going to walk down about two or three blocks and you're going to see it on your left hand side. You can't miss it. So that is a wrap. We hope you enjoyed our Taiwanese street food guide. Now over to you. What is your favorite Taiwanese street food? Do you have a favorite night market in Taipei?

Come join us in this Nepal Travel Guide as we cover the bustling and vibrant city of Kathmandu and embrance all of its chaos before hopping on a bus bound for serene Pokhara where lakes and mountain views are in high demand. Our travel guide to Nepal covers major attractions, things to do and local eats to help make your trip to Nepal a better one. Some of our personal favorite experiences include hiking, boat rides, exploring temples and sipping on tea while in total awe of the natural scenery. Nepal is a country that left a tremendous impression upon us to the point we're counting down the days, weeks and months until we can return again. Now let's explore Nepal together! Well good morning. It is our first full day in Kathmandu (काठमाडौं). We are up bright and early. Yep. It is surprisingly cold here. We're visiting in January. So I think it is nine o'clock in the morning here and it is about 8 degrees outside. Eight degrees. So yeah, a little nippy. Yeah, you can see our breathe. We haven't been wearing our warm clothes in quite a while. So yeah. And yeah traffic is starting to pick up. Lots of motorcycles, cars, honking. There is no sidewalks. I'm surprised by the lack of sidewalks here. So we're just walking along the road and we're going to go explore. It should be a good day. Sometimes it’s nice to be surprised by a destination, so we arrived in Kathmandu (काठमाडौं) without a whole lot of prior research. We knew we wanted to see the temples and palaces around Durbar Square (Basantapur Darbar Kshetra), but that was about it. Since our hotel was about 30 minutes on foot from the Square, we took this as an opportunity to go on a very leisurely walk and meandered up and down some back streets. We were up early, but Kathmandu (काठमाडौं) was buzzing. Scooters were racing to work, vendors were setting up their fresh produce, and construction work was well underway. So we have made it to our first stop of the day. We're at Durbar Square and this is kind of like the main square. It is surrounded by Buddhist and Hindu temples and shrines. Lots of pigeons. Sam is filming them right now. He is doing a timelapse. Um, but yeah as you probably know there was an earthquake in April of 2015 so a lot of the temples came down. So we're seeing a lot of restoration work and a lot of ruins. So we're just going to take you on a little tour of the square right now and show you what it looks like. Once we arrived in Durbar Square, we bought our tickets for 1000 rupees. If you’re interested in hiring a local guide to show you around and share some of the history behind this UNESCO World Heritage Site, you can easily find one next to the ticketing booth and agree on a fee. Due to the earthquake some structures were reduced to rubble, while others aren’t safe to enter at the moment and are being held up by scaffolding, so we mostly just looked at the structures from the exterior. Alright, so next up we are in Indrachok (इन्द्रचोक) if I'm pronouncing that correctly. It is a market area and yeah very lively. Yeah. Thoughts? I'm seeing lots of gold colored souvenirs. Yes. Seeing lots of North Face types of things. Yes. And also kind of bright looking saris. Lots of color yeah. Very colorful. Very busy and bustling. For some trivia, this market was once part of the old trade route between India and Tibet. We really enjoyed walking through here since the market is geared at both locals and tourists. That means you can find shops selling every day items like blankets, slippers and cookware, but you can also find shops full of souvenirs like wooden masks, puppets and prayer bowls. Hi! Hi. So we've had a busy morning. Yes, we have. We've been walking around all morning. And now we're at a place called the City of Dreams. No, the Garden of Dreams (स्वप्न बगैंचा). Hahaha. Oh my gosh. That is in Macau. Whoops. We're at the Garden of Dreams. Garden of Dreams (स्वप्न बगैंचा) and there is a beautiful little cafe and restaurant here. So we're just relaxing and it is a Viennese style cafe. Yeah. So it is pretty cool. So these gardens are partly funded by the Austrian government. Right. So we're just going to grab some food here. Sam is going to enjoy Viennese coffee. Yes, it was a Viennese mocha coffee and apparently it is going to have cinnamon, almonds and some dark chocolate. Oh la lah. That sounds very good. So the drinks have arrived. Indeed, they have. So I got myself some honey ginger lemon tea. It is what I've been ordering every single day since we've been here. At every restaurant and cafe I go to. Mmmm. That is nice. And I like that they put big chunks of ginger in there. So then I chew them. This is kind of nice snack. There is a copious amount of honey in the bottom. Lots of honey in the bottom. It was so thick. And cookies. A little cookie to go with it. So your coffee is just full of layers. Yeah. Check that out. Yeah, I'm just it is kind of like overflows. I'm just going to take a spoon. Going for the whipped cream it seems. Mmmm. Oh, that is foam. That is the foam. It is frothy. Really frothy and I got a huge bite of cinnamon there too. Oh. I'm just going to stir that now. And then I'll actually try a sip. Yeah, and you can probably hear the sounds of traffic off in the distance. So it is kind of nice being a little bit removed from the chaos for a few minutes. Oh, that is a really nice coffee. It is surprisingly not that sweet. I thought it would be a little bit sweeter. But yeah, I can taste it has got a bit of a nutty taste and I also really taste the cinnamon and the little bit of chocolate that has been put on top of the whipped cream. Alright, so now we're just waiting for food. Yep. It is momo (饃饃) time. Do do do do da doo. Hahaha. So we ordered vegetable momo today. So first up I'm going to cut this in half. Follow me to my plate. Let's break these open. Oh wow. Ooh. I smell curry. This smells really nice. Look at that. Woah. So we got some veggies in there. I'm going to grab some of this sauce. I don't know if this is spicy. This is an experiment. That looks so good Audrey. That looks so good. Mmmm. Oh yeah. What do you think? That is really tasty. It is just like finely chopped veggies mixed in with some curry. It is really really nice. I'm going in for another dunk. What is the sauce like? A little spicy. Uh! Oh my gosh. Now it is going to be really spicy. Not just a little spicey. And good? Mmmm. So Sam wants to introduce everyone to the monster who lurks deep in the city. What is it? The scariest thing in Kathmandu (काठमाडौं). The wire monster. The wire monster. There is the wire monster. And there is a few of them. We're going to show you. Alright guys, so we made it to the Momo Hut and I think the name says it all. This place specializes in momo (ममचा). And actually they have over 20 varieties. Some of the fillings are a bit unusual. You can get ostrich, a rabbit, chicken sausage, peanuts. But we've gone for something a little a little more tame. We are having palak paneer. That is our savory one and we also got yummy chocolate with melted ooey gooey chocolate. We're not just calling it yummy chocolate. That is actually the name. That is the name of it. So it better be yummy. Show us that name. The name. Show us the yummy chocolate. Yummy chocolate. Indeed. The 1st order has arrived. Check it out. This is our palak paneer momo. And palak paneer is basically like a cottage cheese with uh spinach. So I'm going to break it in half. It is actually one of my favorite Indian curries. Yeah. Ooh. So it looks like the exterior is probably spinach based on the color. And then you've got the cottage cheese inside. Sauce wise the red one is supposed to be spicy, the yellow is mild. Let's start with mild. Let's see how that goes. And then we can kick it up another notch. Mmmm. Tasty? Mmmm. That is really good. It reminds me a lot of the Korean mandu (만두) that we were eating in Seoul. Oh yeah? Yeah. Okay, let's go for the hot sauce. Hopefully I will not regret this. Mmmm. Which sauce do you like more? I like the spicy one. It is not that hot. It is really good. Okay. I sure hope they all have peanut butter inside. Oooh. Not only is a peanut butter but it is like warm peanut butter. It is melted. Melted and gooey and rich and creamy. And you have that chocolate sauce and you have that honey. The only thing I regret is that we didn't order the large portion. We only got the five. Womp womp. Who gets the 3rd one? We each get two. Hahaha. We'll fight for that one. Rock, scissor, paper right? Well good morning. It is day two in Kathmandu (काठमाडौं) and today's excursion is to the Monkey Temple. I believe the name is Swayambhunath (स्वयम्भू स्तूप) if I'm pronouncing that correctly. So basically we 'googled' the address. We found google maps and we've been walking probably about 30 minutes through neighborhoods, muddy roads. I don't think we're taking the most direct way to get there but I think we're close so we're going to keep pushing. How are you doing? I'm doing great. I hope we're close. Yeah. It seems we have found the Monkey Temple (स्वयम्भू स्तूप). We can see it off in the distance. Can you see it? It is like up there on that hill. Anyways, I think it is going to be another half hour to get there so in total less than an hour of walking. I think we overestimated. I disagree with you. I think we're 15 minutes from here. Let's set the clock. We have made it to the base. This is the base of the Monkey Temple (स्वयम्भू स्तूप) and we are already seeing monkeys. I will admit I'm slightly intimidated by the monkeys. There is a lot of them and they are not shy. They will walk right up to you and they don't look aggressive but they're a little too confident for my liking. 350 steps to the top. I can almost taste sweet victory. Ha, how are you feeling? Yeah, we've earned the views of this attraction today I will say that. Lots of walking so far. Once you reach the Monkey Temple, you’ll find a giant stupa with Buddha's eyes looking out in all 4 directions. Then, when you’re done walking around the stupa, you’ll notice a small square surrounded by small shops where you can pick up even more souvenirs. So we have finally made it to the top. It did take us about an hour from the time we left the hotel. But yeah, it is pretty cool up here. There is incense burning, candles are lit. We've got monkeys everywhere. Bells are ringing so there is a lot going on for sure. Sam lost interest a while ago. I don't know if you can make him out. Over there. Over there. Awful tourist. Well hello you. Hey. What happened? I just finished seeing it faster than you did. Are you sure about that? Yeah, and I'm not a huge fan of monkeys so I had enough of the monkeys. I think you missed a whole section over there. Are you serious? I don't think so. Sam just did a quick circle and he's like 'okay' I'm done. I'm done. Okay, so travel update. We just finished visiting the Monkey Temple. Yep. And now we're riding a taxi to visit Pashupatinath Temple (पशुपतिनाथ मन्दिर) which is one of the more popular ones here in Kathmandu (काठमाडौं). Yeah, it is kind of a little bit far from where we're staying. It is closer to the airport. Yes. So yeah, that is not within walking distance.Yeah. We are attempting a full u-turn in the middle of traffic. Just stopping traffic for us. Are you cursing Sam? No, it is warm. I'm saying it is warm. Another thing to do in Kathmandu (काठमाडौं) is to experience rush hour like a local. We've been sitting here in this taxi not moving how long now? 10 minutes? 15 minutes? 15 I'd say. Tick tock. Tick tock. This next temple is a sacred Hindu site (पशुपतिनाथ मन्दिर) where many believers choose to be cremated. According to the Nepalese Hindu tradition, the body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati River in order to break the reincarnation cycle. We would recommend getting a guide to tour the temple complex, because it can be tricky to navigate and know where you can and cannot go. So we had another very busy morning of sightseeing on day 2. And right now it is lunchtime. We found a restaurant it is called Rosemary restaurant I believe and I've ordered Paneer Butter Masala. I'm really excited for that with roti. And Sam has gone for non-traditional food so he refuses to appear on camera because he's having gnocchi. Well, food has arrived. We're having the paneer butter masala with roti. Which is kind of like a flat-bread. Oh, that looks so good here. That is warm actually. That is a really generous portion. Oh lah lah. And I am being extra generous and sharing because Sam's food is going to be a while. Yeah, he got a little fancy. I'm not embarrassed by the way that I'm having gnocchi. So yeah, there is some really good International food in Kathmandu (काठमाडौं). Yeah, there sure is. We've really been enjoying kind of mixing it up. Enjoying local foods and also enjoying some good International food. It is so creamy. Wow. Oh man. Let's have some more of the paneer. Yeah, grab one of them. Let's fish them out. Oh there it is with a big chunk. Look at that. Wow. I'm so hungry right now. I know. We've had such a busy day. A lot of walking. Mmmm. Oh yeah. It is surprisingly hot outside. Good stuff? Really good stuff. For someone who is sharing you're sure gobbling a lot. It is cheesy. It looks cheesy. We actually haven't had a bite. So tell us what did you get? So this is the parmesan gnocchi. Know it is Parisian. Are you disappointed? Mmmmm. Parisian gnocchi. How is it? It is really good. Yeah, the gnocchi just kind of dissolves in your mouth. Yeah, it has bechamel sauce. Yeah, this is garlic. Bechamel and there is also some parmesan baked on. Yeah, looks good. Good choice. That is really good. So here is a fun little story about Sam. Every time we go out in Thamel Sam is approached by local men whispering in his ear. And they're like 'weed' want some hash. Opium. Every single time like 10 times a day. If I'm with you and we're holding hands then no. It is less likely. Less likely and it was also happening more often when I had my scruffy beard and my scruffy hair. So today is our last day in Kathmandu (काठमाडौं) and we've been staying in the neighborhood of Thamel. Yep. Which is kind of like the touristy area. And they have a lot of shops where you can pick-up souvenirs and like little trinkets to take back home. So we're going to do a bit of shopping because you know we're winding down. Yep. It is our final day. Got a little bit of room in the suitcase so yeah let's get some stuff. Shopping time. We went shopping. Show us. Show everybody what we got. So we got a singing bowl. Oh my gosh, I'm afraid I'm going to drop something. Be careful here. Well, first of all Sam chose this. Oh yeah, I love that. It is four faces. Show the four different faces. Different expressions. Okay start now. Sad. Yeah. Happy. Happy. Uh, content. Normal. Content. A little grumpy. Grumpy. I think the grumpy one suits you quite well. Yeah Sam, it suits you. And this is the prayer bowl. And I would demonstrate. Try it. I won't. Okay. I can't it just doesn't work when I do it. Put it flat in your palm. I know but I'm like balancing stuff. That is true. Anyways, I promise it works. It sings. Yeah. And uh so yeah we're really happy with those purchases. These will be nice additions to our future home. One day. One day. We are starting to collect now because the finish line is in sight. A few years from now. A few years on the horizon. But yeah that is it. Today we are having Dal Bhat (दालभात). We've been eating Dal Bhat (ডাল ভাত) very very often. So much so Sam has declared it his favorite dish known to mankind. Is that correct? Haha. Well it is definitely our favorite thing here in Nepal (नेपाल). It is what we've been having here more than anything else so. Yeah, so to describe it it kind of like a Nepali Thali Set (थाली). Yeah. So you get your rice and some lentils and we're ordering vegetarian so we're having like a vegetarian curry and just different vegetables and sauces. So we're going to show you that when it arrives. Sam is actually had too much Dal Bhat (दालभात) these last few days so he ordered different local specialty items. I ordered some other side dishes to go along with it. Yeah. So we're going to be sharing. Oh, are we now? I hope so. And that food will be coming soon. So my food is here and it is a proper platter. This is the dal bhat (દાળ ભાત). It sure is. And the dal is the lentil soup right here. Right. It looks more green today. Um, and what I find surprising like here is that here it is more soupy. It is more watery whereas in the past I've had like a thicker dal. Kind of like a curry almost. Yeah, yeah. And then here you have your bhat which would be your rice. Yeah, big mountain of rice and then we have a tonne of different sides dishes. I know. So first up this is the curd. It is kind of like a yoghurt. Yeah. And I believe this is the vegetable Thakali (दाल भात तरकारी) which is kind of like a vegetable curry. Right. Then you've got your pickled vegetable. Not entirely sure what it is. And these are all surprises. Hahaha. We'll see once we dig in to them. Mmmm. Is it good? Mmmhmm. Really good? That is quite nice. Yeah. I guess you can just mix it all together really. Lastly, to wrap up our time in Kathmandu (काठमाडौं), we went in search of a rooftop terrace where we could enjoy a drink and watch the sunset with colourful prayer flags blowing in the wind. So where are we now? And what are we doing? Alright, so we found a little rooftop bar in Thamel. I'm having tea because it is cold. Tea toddler. Sam is having beer. Tea toddler. And we're going to watch the sunset. So yeah, if you can find a place in this area on say third or fourth floor of a building you get some beautiful views. You get some mountain views and then as the sun is setting it is quite incredible I have to say. Yeah, we basically wandered around just looking up like who has a terrace and we found this place completely by chance. They are not officially open yet but they will be in a few days. How cool is that? Here we are. They are actually serving us before they're even open. Here is my beer. Local beer. Gorkha (गोर्खा बीअर). Travel day. Woah. Tire. The tire fell off. Woah. It is smoggy. It sure is. Okay, so good morning from Kathmandu. Today is a travel day. And we're going to Pokhara. I've been calling it Pokhara all along. Apparently that is not how you pronounce it. Yeah, so we're up bright and early. What time is it at the moment? It is seven fifteen. No, it is not even seven thirty. It is seven fifteen. And we're just we're basically dropped off on the side of the road and apparently our bus is going to come here. We are really hopeful this is the right area. Fingers crossed. Double fingers crossed. So the air is quite dusty and polluted in Kathmandu on a normal day but today it is foggy so it is like the fumes are almost getting trapped in the air and you can see that today. The air has texture. It just looks thick and grey over the city. So yeah, that is what Kathmandu is like. We're just waiting by the side of the road breathing in the fumes. Lots of honking going on. And I hope the bus gets here soon. I am really looking forward to Pokhara where it is a lakeside and mountainside setting. So hopefully the air will be a little fresher and cleaner. I'm missing clean air. We're going to be here for 45 minutes. 45 minutes. Yeah, we got here way too early. Our bus doesn't leave until 8 and it is like seven twenty at the moment. No, seven eighteen. I was concerned about traffic because it can be insane and I wasn't sure if rush hour would be chaos and then we'd miss our bus. I guess rush hour is more like an hour later. Sometime between eight and nine. But at seven in the morning yeah the traffic isn't too bad. There is traffic out there but it is not like bumper to bumper. There is no gridlock at this time of day. So how are you feeling about our next destination Pokhara? I'm really excited about it. It is going to be considerably smaller than Kathmandu and it also just from pictures we've seen it looks a lot more scenic. We're going to be out by a lake and I'm looking forward to that because Kathmandu has been fun but it has also been really chaotic. So I'm ready for a change of pace. Haha. Also, I'm mildly amused because we keep seeing these shuttles driving by and everyone is asking Pokhara, Pokhara, Pokhara do you want to come hop on the bus blah blah blah. The thing is these buses and shuttles are like bursting at the seems. There is visibly no more room for people but they are still trying to get us on and yeah we've already bought tickets so really it makes no sense. Doo la looh. Doo lada looh. The horns hear sound a bit like a turkey gobbling. Doo lada looh. We are on the bus. What time is it right now? Eight fifteen. So yeah, it was pretty much on time. Okay. Just a few minutes late. Mind you we've been putting our bags on so that has taken up a bit of time. But yeah, beep beep beep. We're going to start the journey now. And those horns are just incredible. So we're having a bumpy breakfast over here. Um. this is what we've got. Some kind of a noodle dish with potatoes. We're just going to dig in. The noodles are nice. I'm hungry. I didn't have anything to eat at the hotel so it is almost like a brunch for me. Time for a pit stop. We've been driving how long would you say? Two hours? Three hours? No, it has been longer than that. It is now twelve o'clock. I've been sleeping. So we've been on the road for about three and a half hours. We're about half way there. Now it is lunchtime. Alright guys. So you can see on the map where we started, where we are now and where we need to go. Here. And like as we've been traveling the road conditions have been getting a little bit better like in terms of the quality of the roads and also not as much traffic either. Lunchtime. This is pretty sweet. We get a buffet lunch and yeah I'm got a fairly generous plate but I don't want to eat too too much because I usually don't like to eat a lot when we're on a serpentine road. Windy road. Bad combination. So no thanks. So I mostly grabbed some noodles here. I have something that looks a little bit similar to Aloo Ghobi. It has got like cauliflower. Cauliflower and potatoes. And then over here this is some rice with beans. With I think a bean curry. Dal. Sorry, I should say Dal. I keep forgetting to call it Dal. And then last but not least here is mine. That is yours. And then I have something that looks like maybe a yoghurt or a rice pudding. Alright, enjoy. Let's try it. I'm hungry. We have arrived. My camera lens is looking rather dusty but we are here in Pokhara. It was an eight hour journey in the end. So a bit longer than we were expecting. But we are here. I'm hungry guys. First priority is to drop off our bags and get food. Yes. We're getting food. Food is priority number two. Numero Uno. So we are all checked in and it is time for room tour. Room tour. Pokhara cribs edition. There you go. This is literally the fastest room tour ever because my stomach is overriding this room tour. Sam is just thinking food. Food. Food. It is time to eat. But yeah we have a nice view of the hotel. And some mountains off in the distance. Seating area. Let's check out the bathroom. I haven't seen it yet. Alright, so walk in shower. Toilet. Sink. Hello! Bub-bye. Sam is looking ever so serious. This is a hard decision. A very important decision. What will be his first meal in Pokhara? After an eight hour bus ride. I think we're going for comfort food. Did you just take a first sip without toasting your wife. I did. I snuck one in there. Excuse me. Let's try again. Excuse me. Salut. Salut. I'm having a mint lemonade. I forgot for a second. Vino tinto over here. Red wine. Mmmm. And so my first time to try Everest beer here in Nepal. Everest. And we won't be hiking there so I might as well have the beer right? But you know what? You need to read the back of the label. It is quite poetic. Let's see. Nepal. The land of mysterious. The land of mysticism. Oh sorry. I don't have my glasses on. Nepal the land of mysticism and Himalayan grandeur brings you this limited edition of Everest. Oh la lah. Everest. Uh, it is nice. So refreshing. I mean this is one of those chilled glasses and I needed this after sucking in all of that dust. That was an eight hour dust fest on the bus. Plus the one hour wait fest. And the food is here. Oh, wow. That looks very good. Oh wow. That is amazing. Thank you. Oh okay. Alright, hungry hippo said film me first. I'm hungry. No I didn't. I'm hungry. I'm not a hippo. I'm hungry. Um, I forget the name of what I ordered. It was a really long name. I know this is the paneer. You got paneer and it has some tikka spices and I think was it cooked in a tandoori oven? Was that part of it? I don't know. It had like four or five names in the description. Anyways, let's go with this. This looks good. Oooh. Is it good? Wow. Hmmmm. Yeah? Are you going to share? Uh-huh. Oh come on. At least one bite. I'll give you a slice of pizza. Sam, has a whole pizza. Yeah, I have a huge pizza. This I probably could have got the smaller but you know what? I'm hungry so no complaints. Mine has veggies too. It has onions, carrots, capsicum, and a salad and naan. I didn't even mention the naan. Look at that. Yeah, and like show your hand for sense of scale. These are really big portions. This is awesome. Lots of food. This is just what we wanted. Hmmmm. Oh man, this looks. Oh man, this looks so good. Copious amounts of cheese. Melting all over the place. It is really hot. It is obviously freshly made. Fresh out of the oven. You're going to burn your whole palette like that. Hahaha. He wasn't willing to wait thirty seconds. That is awesome pizza. That is good pizza anywhere in the world. But to get pizza this good in Nepal is a really nice surprise. I'm going to really enjoy this meal. Hello. Oh wow I didn't know I was going to be filmed for this. Okay, so I found a Cabernet to bring home and this one is from Chile. So pretty good price. I mean for this part of the world to pay about 11 US dollars is not a bad deal. It is obviously very pricey if I was in Chile but I'm not in Chile. Wine drinking is not a big thing here so this is going to be brought back to the apartment and I will enjoy this. What are you celebrating? I'm celebrating arriving. Okay. Hahaha. Let's go. And that is a wrap for a very very busy day. It has been a busy day. And we have our wine ready. So here is yours. Okay. Let's do a cheers. Cheers. One last salut. Salut. So great adventures to come from Pokhara and we'll be doing lots of food vlogs and other things. Some sightseeing of course and maybe a bit of hiking so please stay tuned for that and we look forward to showing all of that. Alright, see you soon. Soon. Glub glub glub. Good morning. Good morning. Mornin'! Okay, luckily we're not quitting our day jobs to become singers so let's get that out of the way. Haha. Alright, so guys we are in Pokhara (पोखरा) and basically this video is going to be not chronological. Un-chronological. Yeah. Non-chronological. Non-chronological order. Today is our last day in town and it is our first day of sightseeing. So we've basically been hanging out, shopping, eating really well. Catching up on work. We haven't done anything. No but you know what? We have waited until the last day but this is the first day of really good weather. Yes. We've had a lot of haze, a lot of cloud cover. It has been super foggy as well. Yeah. But today it is just unbelievable. Blue skies. Blue skies. We're seeing like snow capped mountains that we hadn't seen before. And today we're going to go out by boat and we're also going to do a little bit of hiking so we can't wait to show you around. So we're by the lake. Yes, we are. There is the lake. We're going to hire a boat next and then we're climbing to the World Peace Pagoda (Pokhara Shanti Stupa). And yeah, let's get started. Kisses. Are you giving morning kisses? Morning kisses. Morning kisses. Morning kisses. Hiring a boat is easy. When you go down to the waterfront you’ll find a large board with all the rates listed. You can either hire your own boat to row, pay to be rowed to the temple in the middle of the lake, or pay to be dropped off at the start of the hiking trail that leads to the World Peace Pagoda (Pokhara Shanti Stupa). So here is our boat. We've upgraded. We paid eight more dollars and that gives us. Sam was afraid he was going to burn in the sunshine. Yeah, this is for me the ginger who freckles a lot. We got an upgrade of a roof and we got mats. This has been such a peaceful ride that I'm actually feeling a little bit sleepy. I feel like I could just curl up on the boat on the carpet and take a nap. But then I'd miss out on the views. And that would probably look a little bit rude to our boatman. Just sleeping during the outing. Sam is filming baby cows. Baby cows. Baby cows. There have been some great opportunities to film this morning. We've had some really good light. I know. Oh my gosh we definitely picked the right day to come out. Well, we are coming to the end. Our very lovely outing. Yeah, that was a great outing and the weather changed completely. It got really hazy again and foggy. So it is like a completely different experience for half of the trip. The first half versus the second half. And now we're preparing to go hiking. So yeah. Yeah. After our boat tour of the lake, we decided to go hiking so we got dropped off at the start of the trail. There’s a small shop on that side of the lake, so you if you need to pick up some water or a few snacks, this is a good place to do so. So we are now hiking to the World Peace Pagoda. And it is meant to be forty-five minutes to the top. It might take a little bit longer because I'm doing this in Sam's crocs. My running shoes got left behind. You don't even have running shoes. Somewhere along the way. You wear my running shoes now. Sam ruined them. And my crocs. They were left behind. Anyway, Sam and I have been finding that we're really out of breath in Pokhara (पोखरा) for some reason. We're just out of shape in general. We are usually panting after climbing two sets of stairs at our hotel and well climbing two sets of stairs probably takes like 30 seconds and this is a 45 minute hike. So woah. You're already out of breath. I have a feeling it is going to be a struggle. Status update? Status update. The hike is getting really steep. Out of breathe. Almost out of water. Out of shape. Womp womp. But in terms of the difficulty this is not a difficult path. No. It is just the altitude, the fact we're out of shape and we got quite a bit of sun. Now it is shaded so that is nice. We're starting to cool down a little bit. Onwards. This is how we feel. Yeah, it was a bit of a sweat fest and it was definitely good exercise. Not a difficult path but now that we're here let's actually check out the Peace Pagoda. Well 'hey hey' Aladdin. That was pretty fun. I have to say you missed out by not going up there. Hey 'shhh' don't tell people. It is true. You didn't do it. Shoelaces are undone. We have visited the Stupa and now the grand plan is food. Food and I'm going to have tea right behind us. So we found a rooftop cafe with a great view of the lake and Pokhara (पोखरा) below. And how did we choose this place? What question were you asking? What do you mean? Sam was going to the restaurants. Do you have the best view? Do you have the best view? And of course everyone is like yeah. I didn't mean it like that. I meant like where is the best view within your restaurant. I didn't mean it like do you have the best view of all of the restaurants. Everyone is going to be like of course we have the best view. Come eat over here. Anyways, we settled on a place and I ordered a Nepali Thali set and Sam is having tea. Yep. So yeah. Well good afternoon from Pokhara (पोखरा). Today we are going shopping. Shopping. Yeah. And the secret is we've actually already gone shopping. We bought some cool stuff. Last night. Last night and now we're going to talk a bit more about what we're going to do in terms of shopping but first don't you need to check out my pants. I'm wearing something new. Look at this. Hippie pants. Can you see that. That is a purchase from last night. Yeah, and Audrey got a pair too but she is not wearing them now. I don't know why but I'm rocking the new hippy pants. Okay, let's see what else we can find. I still want to pick up a few more souvenirs. So Sam found a shirt he loves? We're going to design it though. Change the color. It is hilarious. It is totally politically incorrect but sometimes it is fun to have some. You don't always need a plan. Sometimes you just need balls and a beard. Do you have a beard? I do have a beard. That is the question. Hahaha. I think I'm two for two. Alright, good stuff. So while we've been in Pokhara (पोखरा) we've mainly been hanging out in Lakeside which is the area along the lake. Like the name suggests. And there are so many shops here. If you want to pick up souvenirs or clothes or locally made arts and crafts. Yeah, restaurants, cafes. Also you can arrange a lot of adventure travel from here. Yes. So if you're into paragliding or what else can you do? There is tonnes of stuff. Oh man. There is hiking. You can do micro-flights. A helicopter tour. There is helicopter tours. There is I think even like horse and pony riding. So any kind of adventure stuff. Oh this is also where you would arrange like for a trip to do the Annapurna Circuit (अन्नपूर्ण). The big hike trek. Yes. If you do the whole circuit it takes about two weeks. 14 days. Yeah, but I mean we're mainly here to relax so we've just been hanging out, eating well, enjoying a quiet setting. Although it is not so quiet right now. You probably here a lot of honking going on. Um but yeah and today we're shopping so let's go. Who is this Audrey? This is my pup friend. I met him like four days ago. So every time we walk past here we have a little pet. Isn't that right? Yes, it is. You're the most chill pup we've met in a while. You just hang out, you like stokies, you like attention. Yes. If you see us you'll come walking over. Yes. Yes, to all of the above. Yes. So as we've already mentioned we did quite a bit of shopping while we were in town. So we just wanted to show you guys what we got so you have an idea of what you can buy in Pokhara (पोखरा). And maybe I did most of the shopping not Sam. Um, we did a lot of shopping. Since we're going to India next I got some clothes. I need something light and breezy so linen shirt. Wooden blue. That is a nice one. I like that one. I really like this one? Oh you do? That one was like six bucks. Mmmhmmm. This one was ten. But it is longer. Alright, I forgot that you got two of them. Wow. So yeah. That will come in handy. Yep. Let's see. What else did. Oooh, I got hippie pants because when in Nepal (नेपाल). Yeah. Tada. That is something we both got. We both got hippy pants. Actually you know what is funny? When we were at the store Sam is like showing my this pair. He's like what do you think of these hippie pants? And I'm like Sam that is a skirt. You should have noticed he was looking at a skirt. Which is ridiculous but so Sam. Yeah. We got this. I think this would be cool like on a coffee table or something. You can set like a teapot or a coffee pot or anything warm. Or like even on the dining table. Yep. For the future home because we don't actually for the future home that we don't have yet. Okay, I got some toys. I got stuffed animals. Hahaha. Oh my. I got an elephant. That is cute. I love its eyes. That is the best part. Sam picked out the color. Yep. I was like what there was a whole bunch of them and you're like pick one. I'm like definitely that one. I got a bunny. Yeah. Just because it is cute. Yes. It is cute. Are they going to be friends? Yes. Or will they be mortal enemies? Friends. Friends? Instant friends! That is good to know. Sam got hippie pants. Tada. This is not the skirt. These are the actual pants. Yes, this is the real deal. Yeah. They almost don't fit me. They look fabulous. They kind of go down to my not quite to the bottom of my ankles but. Yeah, the guy who was selling them. He just like rolled them up for Sam and he's like here you can wear them kind of like fisherman's trousers. Thanks guy. Anything else? One more thing. This one is Sam's as well. Oh right I like this one too. This one says Nepal (नेपाल) and then it has the flags so. That is really cool. I don't have a lot of long-sleeve shirts at the moment because yeah we've been traveling in really warm places. I may borrow this as a pajama. No, I don't think you will. I think I'll actually wear this one myself. Anyways, so yeah that is all we got. Shopping in Nepal (नेपाल). When we weren’t out sightseeing, which was most of the time, we were restaurant hopping and enjoying the food. The following is the best meal that we had in Pokhara (पोखरा). The food is here and it looks amazing. Check it out. I'm having something called Chhwelā (छ्वेला). And this is fish from the local lake. It is marinated in secret spices. That is what it says in the menu. They won't even tell you what is in it. I love that. And it is barbecue. That is the best. In the tandoor oven according to the menu so I didn't even see this being prepared. Secret spices. But it looks so good. If you look at that pieces of fish like they're so plump and oh my gosh this just looks fresh. Do some more dissections for us. More dissections. Here we are in the science lab. Yes. I am dissecting the fish. Exactly. Anyways, I'm going to try some of this already. It looks so good. Wow. Man, it looks like there is some tomatoes in there and maybe cilantro. Mmmm. Is it good? Yeah? That is really good. I chose well. The fish it is so soft. It melts in your mouth. I just had some kind of insect bite my elbow. Oh my gosh. If there is a little shaky that is why. Sam's being attacked. Bad camera man. The mosquitos want the fish. Hahaha. This is so nice. That is cilantro. Little chunks of tomato. Let me zoom in on that. It looks like a little bit of a yellow curry. Oh wow. Man, you can see that so well now. It is good. So the one that I ordered was a Pokhara style curry. And it comes with fish and we had the choice between chicken and pork I believe. And let's stir that around a bit. Oh la lah. So you can see there is nice big chunks of fish over here too. It looks really good. It looks like the same fish they used for mine. Yeah. I'm sure it is. So it also comes with brown rice. Which is nice. We had the choice between brown rice and white rice so we're making the adult decision to get the healthier brown rice. The healthier version. I think brown rice is tastier anyway. I agree with you on that. So I'm just going to have a bite and then I'm going to go for a bite of rice. So let's see what dish comes out on top? You know what? They said that this was a must try dish on their menu. Yeah. And I totally agree. Like that curry is just so good, so rich. It is like a thick flavorful curry. And then because the fish has obviously been marinated and cooking in there for a long time it is even I think it is even more tender than the fish from your dish. Wow. The fish from your dish. That kind of rhymes a bit. That could be a rap. The fish from your dish. Yeah, that is my bad attempt at rapping. But uh yeah it is so good I'm going to have another bite with the rice. So don't mind my thumb here. You do have a knife. I do. And a fork and a spoon. To make it work. It is more fun to eat with your hands whenever you can. Yeah that rice really compliments it well. It helps sop up a bit of the gravy. We also enjoyed hanging out in the lakefront bars. Happy hour may have been the draw for most people but I was here to drink tea and play with the resident pets. I made a friend. I made a friend. Oh you're sleepy. You are so sleepy. I'm getting sleepy too pup. I just had a big meal and I'm going to have a glass of wine and I'm going to enjoy this fire that we are right beside. Hello kitty. Audrey you're the animal whisperer today. Who do you have now? Oh, I forget her name. I forget her name too but it is a sweet little kitty. Her name is cry baby. That is what I remember. Cry baby. Is she getting all snuggly. Is she getting all snuggly with you by the fire. Yes. She's cute. Tonight we're along the lakeside because they have a lot of little like cafes and bars where we can come and enjoy the views. Yeah. Have a drink. It is great for nightlife in Nepal (नेपाल). It is just awesome. It is really nice. And yesterday we visited a place called I think Purple Planet. Yep. Today we were at the Bamboo Hut. Bamboo Hut. Bamboo bar. Right. And I befriended a cat and a dog. I know..So sweet. Best. Especially that cat. That cat fell asleep on you. I know. I don't think it would have left had you not you know. Had we not left. Anyways, we're going to now try to find a place that has some live music. Apparently around this time of night between around seven and eight they start playing live music. I hear it off in the distance. So let's go check it out. Let's follow our ears. So that’s a wrap for our time in Pokhara (पोखरा). Most travellers who come all the way out here generally do so to hike the Annapurna Circuit, but we had neither the gear nor the desire to undertake a lengthy trek. Fortunately for us, Pokhara (पोखरा) proved to be the perfect place to unwind after a few months of busy travel, and we still got to enjoy views of the Annapurna Mountain Range (अन्नपूर्ण). We hope that you enjoyed our travel guide to Nepal.

When it comes to remarkable travel adventures few can top what this country has to offer. Even for the seasoned traveler India has an uncanny ability to dazzle, frustrate, inspire, confound and mesmerize unlike any country we've ever visited. Join us as we journey from Delhi to Kolkata in this India travel guide covering everything including our travel experiences in each destination, transportation by train, local food and unique accommodations. Our trip in India starts in Delhi before we head off by train to explore Rajasthan including stops in the Golden City of Jaisalmer, the Blue city of Johdpur and the Pink city of Jaipur. We then head to Agra to visit the Taj Mahal and then take an overnight train to marvel at the ancient city of Varanasi. Our last stop is Kolkata where this great adventure ends. Now let's explore India together in this travel guide kicking things off in Delhi. Well good morning from Delhi. It is our first day of sightseeing. Sam's parents arrived last night. Yeah. We've got the full group for travels. The squad is ready. We're going to be doing. We're going to be in Delhi for a couple of days. Yeah, just a that is how we're kicking things off. And yeah we just started by walking around today. We're visiting the Red Fort (लाल क़िला - لال قلعہ‎) right now. Yeah, and you know what we also have a fancy new camera. We're shooting with a Lumix. Maybe the image quality is better. I hope so. This camera is going to be cool because we're going to be able to get a lot of slow speed footage and we're really looking forward to taking a lot of those types of shots. Especially when we're taking our train rides. All over India. Yeah, so right now we're visiting the Red Fort (लाल क़िला - لال قلعہ‎) and honestly this is probably going to be a bit of a different format because we obviously want to spend time with Sam's parents. I don't think we're going to be filming as much but we're going to show you some of the highlights and kind of see how it works out. So let's go tour Delhi now. The Red Fort (लाल क़िला - لال قلعہ‎) turned out to be far larger than anything I was expecting. After purchasing our tickets, we entered through the imposing Lahori Gate, then walked through a bazaar, before finding ourselves in a series of courtyards, audience halls, and imperial apartments. So we are quickly discovering this place is pretty amazing. And just to give you a little bit of background information the Red Fort (लाल क़िला - لال قلعہ‎) used to be the main residence of the Emperors of the Mughal Dynasty. And then when the British took over this was turned into a fortress. Um but it amazing. It is a huge complex and there is so many different gates and buildings to visit once you're inside. So you can just walk and enjoy it at a leisurely pace. And it is amazing. It is pretty cool. All of the walls are made of red sandstone and it just looks beautiful when the sunlight is hitting it. So we're really enjoying this. This is our first attraction of the day and we're already blown away. Okay Sam so what have we just learned about this place? About this green lawn. So apparently back in the day this was the area where there were lion and tiger fights. Lion and elephant fights. Oh, elephant fights for the Emperor's entertainment. Well, there you go. So that must have been quite a spectacle. I know. I couldn't imagine that happening here. Now it is like just this peaceful grounds and this may be where they have night performances. Yeah, there is a lot of benches and we've seen like a evening concert advertised. So yeah. A different type of entertainment for sure. A little bit different these days. A little milder. Slightly tamer. So Sam you've been making lots of new friends in between filming. Lots of new friends. We're like b-list celebrities. Just kidding. We've been posing with a lot of families. We've been posing with a lot of families. We've been meeting a lot of people. It is cool. There has been people traveling to Delhi from like Mumbai and Kashmir and all over the place. Yeah, from all over India. All over India. So it is cool. There is a lot of tourists from just India itself. Yeah. After wandering around the Red Fort (लाल क़िला - لال قلعہ‎) for an hour or so, it was time for a little break, so we decided to introduce my parents to their first cup of masala chai in India. So we're drinking a Masala Chai. Cheers. We're taking a little break here at the fort. Cheers. Cheers. From there we went on a short tour of Old Delhi (पुरानी दिल्ली)‎‎ during rush hour, which in retrospect may not have been the best idea. It was a little too crowded to walk, so we popped into a restaurant for lunch instead. Alright, so we walked through Old Delhi (पुरानी दिल्ली)‎‎. What are the first impressions of that? Very loud. Lots of traffic. Lots of honking. Was it an assault on the senses? Yes. Yes but in a good way. Yes. Sam do you want to tell us what we're eating today? Yeah, so we've got a nice spread of food. Over here we have Palak Paneer which is kind of a spinach curry with big chunks of cottage cheese. Yeah. And over here we have our curd. Yeah, I forget what that one was and then we have our roti bread. Nice big thick pieces of bread. And we're going to share everything. A feast of feasts. So what do you think of the bread Dad? Very puffy. Very puffy. I'm looking forward to putting the spreads on. Yeah, so my turn for a bite. I'm just going to try and get a little bit of everything. Lots of Palak Paneer. A bit of curd. Oh man, that is fantastic. It is so good. Loving this meal. Everything is so cheap so. We're going to be feasting for a while. Okay so day two update. I guess we should explain what we did for the rest of day one. So we visited the Red Fort (लाल क़िला - لال قلعہ‎). We had some tea. Yeah. Then we wanted to visit Jama Masjid (जामा मस्जिद - جامع مسجد). The mosque. Yeah, the biggest mosque in Delhi but unfortunately during the time we went it was closed to foreigners. It was prayer time. So we couldn't go. So we ended up having a really good lunch which we've showed and then we went back and it was siesta time. We were all really tired. And then we just had more food and more food. Yes. So today is the start of day two and our first stop is Humayun's Tomb (हुमायूँ का मकबरा - آرامگاه همایون). We've just bought our tickets. It was 500 rupees. Yeah, 500 each. Yeah, and it looks amazing already so we're going to start touring. Exciting. So Sam you've been to Delhi before but this is one attraction you completely missed. Yeah, the last time I was in Delhi I had a horrific case of food poisoning so I didn't get to do this place. So this is like a brand new experience for me. It is really cool. What do you think of it? It kind of reminds me a little bit of a mini Taj Mahal. Yeah. And now that Sam mentions that Humayun's Tomb (हुमायूँ का मकबरा - آرامگاه همایون) is actually believed to be a precursor to the Taj Mahal which would come 60 years later. So there are some architectural similarities. But I mean we'll decide that for sure once we get to Agra. After visiting Humayun’s Tomb (हुमायूँ का मकबरा - آرامگاه همایون), we took two cycle rickshaws over to the Lodi Gardens. It was getting close to lunch hour, so first we stopped at “Lodi - The Garden Restaurant” where we had a really nice meal in an outdoor setting. From there we were just a few steps away from the actual gardens, which proved to be a popular spot on the weekend. So it is a beautiful Sunday afternoon and we have finally made it to the Lodi Gardens. And it is such a lively place. There is so many families having picnics and couples wandering around. Couples wandering around. There is people playing cricket, badminton and just enjoying being out with family and friends. It is just a cool environment. Like just it is packed. Packed with people. Yet it is big enough that you feel like you still get some of your own pockets of space. The Gardens are named after the Lodhi Dynasty, who ruled parts of northern India from the mid 15th century to the early 16th century, before the rise of the Mughal Empire. The gardens contain various tombs and mosques, and it’s a very tranquil setting in what can otherwise be a very chaotic city. Well good morning. It is day three here in Delhi ((दिल्ली ਿਦੱਲੀ)) and this morning we're back at Jama Masjid. We came early before prayer so that we're able to visit. So yeah, we're going one of the minarets because apparently you get some really cool views of Delhi (दिल्ली ਿਦੱਲੀ). And today is actually our last day in the city so we're just sightseeing in the morning and then later this afternoon we're going to be catching the train over to the desert to Jaisalmer. So that is exciting. And so begins the accent up the tower. Alright Sam so we climbed the tower. What did you think? We it is our morning exercise today. It sure was. We had a big breakfast so that was a good exercise for sure. Uh, I thought it was actually pretty easy to climb up. Like the steps were not difficult. Some other towers I've climbed up before have been really tricky in terms of the stepping. So that was fine but when you get to the top if you're afraid of heights like we are it is a bit intimidating but it is also amazing. So I think it is worth just getting over it and going up and getting a view. But it can get a little crowded up there so we headed down quite quickly after reaching the top. Yeah, so you've got the tower over here and there is only one staircase going up and down so you're basically competing with people. Yeah. And like kind of having to press your body against the wall. So a little bit stressful I would say. I wouldn't call it an easy climb. Like most structures in Old Delhi (पुरानी दिल्ली)‎‎, Jama Masjid (जामा मस्जिद - جامع مسجد) is made of red sandstone and white marble, and it also happens to be one of the largest mosques in all of India. So we're at the train station here in Delhi (दिल्ली ਿਦੱਲੀ) and that means we are wrapping up the trip here. What an adventure. So yeah that is it for our time in Delhi. That was an assault on the senses. Oh yes. Delhi is a very chaotic but yet exciting city and there is a lot to do but it is the kind of place where once you've seen a few attractions and you're ready to move on yeah. Yeah, it is time to move on. And we are moving on. Where are we off to next? We're off to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. So this is somewhere I've been before. I'm so excited to be going there. So stay tuned for those adventures. We've got a lot more destinations in India to come. Bye! Our first India train ride was a long overnight journey from Delhi to Jaisalmer. The station was quite busy with passengers coming and going, so it was a little tricky to navigate. We also somehow managed to print a booking confirmation that didn’t show our seat numbers, so that added another layer of confusion once our train pulled into the station. Well we are finally on a moving train. I would say that was very very very stressful. It took stress to a whole new level. Yeah, we kind of made a mistake. We booked our tickets like 3 months ago and we forgot to update our tickets to make sure what our seats were. We just printed off these tickets saying oh yeah we've got our confirmation and we've got our seat numbers. But we didn't get our seat numbers so we got on the wrong train and we didn't know where to sit. It took us a long time to sit down and then finally uh we eventually did sit down and it wasn't the right place. It has been a long day but the cool thing is we're going to wake up in the morning and we'll still have like I don't know five or six hours of our journey left. So we'll be showing you a lot more scenery and we'll be giving you a room tour then. For this leg of our travels we booked seats in AC1 which is a first class 4-berth cabin. No meals were included in the price of our ticket, but thankfully there were lots of vendors coming by selling things like chai, chips, and cookies, so we made the most of that. Thank you Sir. Thank you. So Sam what did you get from the Chai Wallah (चायवाला)? Well, the only thing that he sells is chai so we're going to have chai (मसाला चाय). What do you think Dad? Yes. Cheers. Cheers to chai (मसाला चाय). Cheers to chai. And it was only 10 Rupees. Yeah. Which is like oh my gosh I don't even know what that is. It is like less than 20 cents for sure. 15 cents. That is one of the deals. I'm having trouble doing math. I'm tired. More snacks. Sandwich. I'm hoping for peanuts. 200. 200. There you go. Haha. Alright Sam you want to show us the spoils? Okay, so I'm going to show you what we got for 300 Rupees. 200 Rupees. 200 sorry. So three sandwiches. 3 sandwiches. What kind of sandwiches? I think cheese and maybe tomato. Cheese and something else. So we've got these. Cookies. Two cookies. Peanuts and chips. Woah! So we paid less than about 3 US bucks for that. So I'd say that is decent value. Haha. We don't know if we're getting fed or not so this will last us until the morning. Sam is enjoying a mystery ingredient sandwich. It looks like I have no idea. What does it look like? I thought it was cheese like processed cheese. But it is not. It has got white bread. I honestly have no idea I just know it is white bread. The only thing that is identifiable is the white bread. Exactly. White bread. I'm so hungry I don't care. Well good morning we survived our first night on an Indian train. I actually slept pretty well. I was really really tired after yesterday. It was just such a busy day. So yeah, now it is morning. It is about eight thirty. Um, we're already in the desert so the landscape has changed. It is more like dry and arid. The earth is red and we've had some breakfast. We've had some chai and we've also ordered some mains so that should be coming soon. So what is going on? Breakfast time. Thank you Sir. Thank you very much. The big unveil. We are having toast. And more toast. And more toast. Four pieces of toast. With jam with ketchup. And uh vegetarian fried vegetable ball. Batter ball? Hahaha. We don't know what this is called. But we'll eat it. Okay, I have no idea if I'm doing this right but I'm going to make a sandwich here. Look at that. No ketchup for you Sam? No. Here Deb. How is it? Do you want some too? It is not bad. Not bad? Taste it. But not amazing? Yeah, I wouldn't call it amazing but I am hungry in the morning. I'll eat it. So we've had so many chai that we've built up a tower. A tower of chai and we've got 4 more coming here. Thank you. Thank you very much. It is time for a skill testing question. How many cups of chai did we have for breakfast? Comfy over there? If we can offer one tip regarding train travel in India, it would be to book your tickets well in advance. We booked ours several months ahead and struggled to get seats together in some of our later journeys. There is a tourist quota of tickets that you can book in person, but the larger the group, the harder it’ll be to get on your desired train, so plan ahead. What are you doing Sam? Just cleaning the windows. So we can film a little better. This is what we've got from the window so far. Oh hahaha man. This is the first class cabin. Yeah. And now I'm drying it off with my hand towel that they gave us. Deciphering the various train classes in India can be a little tricky since there are as many as 8 seat and sleeper classes. Just remember that AC1 and AC2 classes will offer the most comfort, but if you’re on a real budget the sleeper class is the cheapest and most adventurous way to travel. Well well we've almost arrived. I'd say. We have almost arrived. Yeah. We had a second nap after breakfast so I'm still a little like arrggghh drowsy. But anyways we're going to give you guys the grand room tour. So for this journey we booked 1st class AC apparently that means aircabin. And this is what it looks like. And the noise you hear from above that is the AC. Yeah so. The fans are pretty loud. Yes they are. Basically you've got four bunks. You have a door and the other classes only have a curtain for privacy. Right. And the door is actually of the sliding variety. So haha. Anyways I slept up top, Sam slept on the other side. So you're given bedding. You're given like what two sheets? A towel and a warm blanket. Blanket and a pillow. Right. And then you can buy breakfast in the morning. There is people who walk by offering chai and snacks and sandwiches. So yeah and we also get to enjoy the views. Yeah. And so it is four people per cabin. 4 people per cabin. So yeah we're very much out in the desert at this point. Yeah, so for the next train journeys we're also going to be doing second class and third class because that is all that was available for some routes. But yeah, this is living it up on an Indian train (भारतीय रेल) people. We have arrived let's go find transportation. That is my update. So this is a pleasant surprise. We just exited the station thinking we'd have to find transportation but the hotel actually sent a free shuttle. So it is all sorted and it is free. You've gotta like that. Well guys the journey was worth it. It was long, it was tiring but we finally arrived in Jaisalmer (जैसलमेर). Our hotel is amazing. So that is going to be a separate vlog. Yeah. We'll give you a proper hotel tour. But yeah, we're happy to be here. We are. It has been a really long journey. And it is one of those things you so appreciate being there after such a long journey. Haha. Anyways we need food and we need sleep. I can't even speak properly. We'll see you later. Ciao. Bye. After an 18 hour overnight train ride from Delhi, we finally reached Jaisalmer (जैसलमेर), a city of yellow sandstone that lies in the middle of the Thar Desert (लाइक,कमेंट व सब्सक्राइब करे). This proved to be my favourite stop of our month long adventure in India; now let me take you on a tour and show you why. Well good morning from Jaisalmer (जैसलमेर). We have finally found a quiet little spot in this maze of a fort (जैसलमेर फोर्ट). Confession time. We've tried like several intros but there has been a lot of beeping. It is so loud. Um but yeah we're exploring the main attraction today which is the fort and it amazing. I can see why this city is called the Golden City of India. Just the yellow sandstone glows in the sun. It is beautiful so we finally made it inside the fort (जैसलमेर फोर्ट). It is a huge maze of hills going up and down and little alleys. Yeah. We're just going to spend the morning exploring and seeing what we find here. Yeah, it is incredible and something to keep in mind is that it is a living fort (जैसलमेर फोर्ट) meaning that there is merchants, there is hotels, there is restaurants and you can visit anytime of day. Shopping time. We all know how much Sam enjoys shopping. You know what? When in India I think it is pretty cool. With all of the different colors. We're actually going to get some stuff for our future house. We've been saying that a lot lately but it is true. With so much colour all around us, it wasn’t long before we were lured into a shop and found ourselves picking out souvenirs in the form of wall hangings, pillow cases, and a small painting or two. Our luggage gained an extra couple of pounds in this city alone. Sam I think we found the shirt for you? I think we have. Can you guess which one it is? Hahaha. Amongst those four. That one right there. Mr Mustache. And the sunglasses. That is totally me. Are you going to start wearing a turban Sam? Uh, I don't know about that. You know what? I have rocked a mustache with glasses before. And you've got the red hat so it kind of works. It kind of works. I got excited thinking these were turbans and maybe we could get Sam one but I think they're just scarves. Although I guess you could use a scarf and turn it into a turban. There are so many shops here that we just keep walking five or ten meters and then popping into a new store. It is just there are so many colors and beads and sequins. So let's go see what we can get. We are shopping for home decor. What did you find Sam? Look at this. There are all kinds of different elephants. An elephant pillow case. But look down here and you see a whole bunch more. I know. I think we're going to pick up a couple. You're going to get a couple. Maybe. But it wasn’t all shopping in Jaisalmer (जैसलमेर). We also made time to do a bit of sightseeing inside the fort, and one of the main attractions here are the Jain Temples (जैन धर्म). We just bought tickets to visit one of the Jain Temples (जैन धर्म) here inside the fort. And it is beautiful. Like the carvings are so intricate and there is such attention to detail it is amazing. What do you think? I think this is pretty amazing. I did visit some Jain Temples the last time I was in Jaisalmer (जैसलमेर) but they were out in the desert and this one here is even more impressive I have to say. Another thing we’d recommend doing in Jaisalmer (जैसलमेर) is having dinner on a rooftop restaurant while the sun sets. There are plenty of restaurants scattered across the city and the views you get as the sun goes down are amazing. We chose one at random and it included a live music performance. So this afternoon we are catching the sunset on a rooftop terrace. We're at the Jaisalmer Oasis restaurant. Yeah, and I mean we're at basically the top level of the fort at the top level of a restaurant. So we are getting some of the best views in the entire city. We almost basically have like 360 degree views of the city. So it is incredible here. We're just waiting for our pizzas to come. Yeah. So we have a view of the Jain temples we visited earlier this morning and you can also see a few different rooftop restaurants off in the distance. (Singing and accordion) It is very easy to get lost inside the fort at night. Once the lights go out but we finally found our way out after wandering in circles for a bit. And now we're going to get some transportation and head back to the hotel for some rest. (Tuk-tuk sounds) The following day was all about visiting the Thar Desert (लाइक,कमेंट व सब्सक्राइब करे) on an afternoon camel trek. It was a nice change of pace from the city, and we got to enjoy a traditional meal cooked over a campfire. So we are currently visiting a Rajasthani style village. Our guide is waiting for us in the truck and my plan is to befriend all the goats. There are so many goats wandering around here. Well the camel adventures are about to begin. We have arrived in the desert. We probably drove for 30 or 40 minutes. Check out the camels. We're going to be picking out a companion. Hopefully a friendly one who doesn't spit in my face. Camel adventure. Camel adventure. Camel Safari. Yeah. And this is like a blast from the past because the last time I was in Jaisalmer (जैसलमेर) I did like a four day camel safari. So we're just doing a short little ride this afternoon but I can't wait to do it. Riding camels is pretty fun. Woop woop. I know how to do this. Okay Sam show us how it is done. Haha. Alright, there is nothing particularly graceful. You just hop on it. One leg over the other. And it rises up. Where do I hold? Oh okay. Yes. Okay. Good. Okay. The camel is squeaking. Hold where? There. Oooh. Wow. Hello friend. This is my camel. Hello camel. Yes. So the first and last time I rode a camel was in Jordan a few years ago. And for some reason I remembered camels being a lot shorter. The one I'm on right now seems really tall and really large and it feels like I'm really far away from the ground. But we're going. We've got a caravan of five and we're on our way. What are we inspecting Sam? Did you rip your pants? (Gypsy dancing and singing) Haha. So Sam update from the desert? Update. You were just getting some sunset shots. Yeah. And we're waiting for dinner. Which is over there. It is cooking. It is cooking right before us. It is cooking. So making chai? Yeah. Chai with like sugar. Sure. Sugar sounds good. No sugar no chai. Haha. Do dah doo. Haha. Trumpet chips. The next morning we went back to the fort because we just couldn’t stay away. I visited the Jaisalmer Fort Palace Museum & Heritage Center, while Sam and his mom picked up a few additional souvenirs for family back home. So right now we're heading to Gadisar Lake (गाडिसर झील). Apparently it is great place to watch sunset and also if you want to do a boat tour over the lake that is another possibility. I have to say it has been so worth it coming here for sunset. Like this has just been incredible. The only other country that I've ever been to that sunsets as spectacular as in India has been in South Africa. And you just see like this golden orb come every single day for sunrise and then again for sunset. It is just unbelievable. Well well we are back at the train station and that means the Jaisalmer train diaries are over. Next destination. Next destination is Jodhpur and that is a short ride compared to this past one. Oh yes. 18 hours versus 5. So we just got an evening train ride. We're leaving here around five and we should be arriving around ten thirty. Woop woop. Alright guys, hello from Jodhpur (जोधपुर). It is time for another hotel tour. We have been staying in a haveli (हवेली) in Jodhpur (जोधपुर) for the last 3 nights. And it is a pretty cool place. Like we mentioned in one of our earlier videos a haveli (حویلی) is kind of like an old style home or an old style mansion that has been turned into a hotel. So the architecture is very typical and the place itself is kind of like a maze. It is really quirky. It is not your typical hotel. So we're going to show you how you get in. Then we're going to give you a room tour. And afterwards we're going to show you the rooftop because you get some amazing views of the whole city. So let's go find Sam and let's get started. Alright, so we have found Sammy boy. Here I am. Do you want to lead us in. Let's go take the grand tour. The grand tour. Okay. We're going to follow your footsteps. So the thing I find really interesting is that we have to go past people's homes. And sometimes their doors are open so we like can peak in. Look at the shoes. You can see the shoes. And then the door. And look you can see there about like 3 inches. I don't know why I'm whispering. Haha. In case the neighbors are listening. So there is another door. Someone's home. And we go up these steps. Alright still going into the haveli (हवेली). It is a bit of a long walk from the gate. But check out this art. Some hand painted art. Elephants. How cool is that? Anyways let's keep going. More stairs. A bit of a workout. Getting to this place. Oh and guys you seriously need to watch your head. This is not for people if you're tall. I just hit my head. Again. While I said that. After saying that. That wasn't even an accident. Sam is out there not following his own advice. Haha. It is not easy being a cameraman. So 360 of the main courtyard. This is also where you have the reception to check-in. But let's go find Sam. So from the courtyard we take this random little hall. More artwork. More elephants. And we have another courtyard. And we have Sam's Dad. Hello Sam's Dad. Haha. And more stairs. We have more stairs. So we continue to climb up. Alright, more stairs. Let's do it. And we're going to be going up yonder. And now we're going to show you the views you get from the rooftop terrace. Let me find the keys. It is a funny little key. And a bit of a giant lock. (Knocking sounds) No need to knock. I already know you're there. Come on in. So now it is time for the grand room tour. Let's keep the sun out because it is really hot. Um, so yeah basically this is it. Let me lock the door so nobody comes in. Basically this is it and what I do like about this room are the paintings on the walls. Like you have these really cool scenes. I know. Right by our deodorant. Oh okay. Up there. Let's stop focussing on the deodorant. Haha. Um, and we have a bed that is like on this low to the ground platform. Yeah. Mattress. It is basically almost on the ground. So yeah. Yeah. I also like the little details they have all along the top of the wall. On the ceiling. Yeah, so it is pretty cool. We have a big rug. Yeah, and like consistent with the rest of the places we've stayed at the ceilings are really high up there. High ceilings. Yeah. They have cool wooden furniture on this side. Yeah, and some of these havelis (हवेली) are like hundreds of years old. Yeah. Like some of them over 500 years old. Yeah, I don't know how old this one is. Yeah. It is part of the mystery. Yeah. But some of them are just like ancient. And you see that with the you know with just the way they're built on the outside. It is unbelievable that they're still standing. Yeah, and yeah it is just bright colors everywhere. Like even on the pillows you've got like hot pink and reds. Um, okay but the best part the best part is the view. Hello. Haha. The best part is definitely the view. We paid for a castle view and that means we get to see the fortress. The big unveil. Tada. Tada. Dah dah dah. Not too shabby guys. Huh? That is castleview. And that is just the right time of day. We're filming this in the afternoon when the sun is hitting it just perfectly. And we almost forgot. Haha. I suppose we should show you the bathroom. I don't really like it. It is a little yucky and it is small and it is dark but let's go so you know what you're getting yourself in to. Yeah. So again if you're tall watch your head because Sam keeps bumping himself. Yeah. If I'm not concussed then I don't know what is going on because I've bumped my head probably at least I don't even know how many times now. 10 times at least? So that is the heater. The heater. Gotta flick it on with a switch. We've got a shower. That is the switch that flicks it on. We've got a shower up there. We have a tiny little sink where you can barely wash your hands. Yep. And a dirty mirror. Urggh. So yeah, the bathroom is not the amazing part. But yeah that is the room so now time for some concluding thoughts after 3 nights here. Time for thoughts from a fancy chair. Yeah, so final thoughts about staying in a haveli (حویلی) here in Jodhpur (जोधपुर). So yeah, highly recommend it. It is one of those unique kind of accommodations that you can only find in very specific locations. Whenever you have a chance to stay in a place with this much character I absolutely recommend it. Um, in terms of the place that we're staying in itself the stay was okay. Yeah, not amazing. There was some just basic things that weren't really met. Like we kept having to ask for toilet paper, for towels, for soap. For bedsheets and things like that. Yeah. They kind of just didn't really prepare the room perfectly. I would agree. Like I would say the service has not been amazing but it is kind of like a quirky property so that is why we wanted to showcase it. And also it gives you guys an idea of what havelis (हवेली) are like because a lot of them have a similar layout. So I would say do stay in a haveli (हवेली) but you don't necessarily have to book the same one. You've got tonnes of options here. Tonnes of havelis (حویلی) and a lot of them have character and charm. So do your research and pick one that is within your budget. Yeah, so that is it from Jodhpur (जोधपुर), Rajasthan, India. Time to send you out the door. Off we go. Off we go. Well good morning from yet another destination in India. Today we are exploring Jodhpur (जोधपुर) and we're actually going to have two whole days here. So pretty pumped about that. Yeah, it is called the Blue City and for very good reason. We'll be showing you that shortly. And yeah we can't wait to travel around here. This is like an essential stop in Rajasthan (राजस्थान ਰਾਜਸਥਾਨ). And you know what is pretty funny? We're both wearing blue. That wasn't actually planned. Oh it totally was. Wearing blue in the blue city. Let's get started. Our first stop in Jodhpur (जोधपुर) was Mehrangarh Fort (मेहरानगढ़ का दुर्ग), which is one of the biggest forts in India. The fort sits on a rocky hill overlooking the city and it pretty much dominates the skyline with its imposing walls. Admission to the fort itself is free, but if you’ve come all the way here, you’ll want to pay the admission to visit the palaces which now act as a museum. So we've just arrived from Jaisalmer where we visited another fort but that one was a living fort where you have hotels and restaurants and temples and shops and people will actually have homes in there. This wasn't doesn't feel like so much like a living fort. It feels a bit more historic. There is actually hardly any tourists there. Maybe it is because we're a bit early. But yeah, it is a pretty cool place. It is massive. So I'm really looking forward to getting deep into the fort and seeing what it is all about. Alright, so it was a bit of a slow accent to the top. It was. But we made it. It is a really odd day. A few beads of sweat. I think a little tip would be to come a bit earlier than we did. We had a late start but man this is amazing. The views from this fort (मेहरानगढ़ का दुर्ग) are just like surreal. I've actually never seen a city quite like this from high atop. I mean from a high vantage point. This is just this fort is incredible and it is the kind of place that if you visit it is going to take hours to explore. It is not one of those like half an hour attractions. You can literally spend a half or even a full day here. There is just so much to see and do. And it is not as touristy as some other forts either in India. You can walk around some different sections and you don't notice that many tourists walking around. Within the fort (मेहरानगढ़ का दुर्ग) you can also visit the ramparts, see the old cannons, and get some overhead views of the city which will quickly help you realize why Jodhpur (जोधपुर) is nicknamed the Blue City. There’s also a nice cafe where you can enjoy a samosa or two. (Traditional Indian Music) Alright guys, so it is about 2pm would you say? Yeah. So that means we've been wandering around the fort for almost 3 hours? Over. Over 3 hours. Over 3. It has been a long outing. We had to stop for food and drink. And if you're going to visit the fort you should budget that amount of time because there is just so much to do and if it does get hot you're going to want to cool off. Yeah, it is massive and I mean it is on a bit of a steep incline so you're going to need breaks along the way. But yeah the views are cool. Sam went shopping. Let's get Sam on camera. Okay Sam, so let's see. What did you get? What did you get? I've been wanting to get these for a long time. Puppets. Puppets. Matching puppets. Alright. I bought one of these for my parents like 8 or 7 years ago. And now these are for us. This is for our future home. Sam is thinking becoming a puppeteer. Yep. A professional puppeteer. Exactly. And what else did you get? Training hard for that. Okay. Watching YouTube tutorials about puppeteering. And this is the last thing. I walked into the store and saw this really cool polo shirt. It is my new supper shirt. Jodhpur (जोधपुर). Fancy dining wear. Fancy. It does look really nice. Are you going to show us your face? Let's see your excited face. That is your excited face? Okay. Bye. Bye. So the best thing about the place where we're currently staying would have to be the views. And the sun is starting to set. You can see the fort back there. And our hotel also has a whole bunch of terraces where you can hangout, have a drink, read a book and yeah just watch the sunset. Check this out. What? So for a little change of scenery we are trading the views from our hotel and we came over to Castle Rock Hotel and Restaurant. Yeah. And the place really lives up to its name. It may have the best views of the fort in the city. I can't confirm that but so far that is definitely our experience. Check it out. Well good morning from Jodhpur (जोधपुर). It is day two in the blue city and of course Sam is wearing blue again. How appropriate. Dressed for the occasion. So yeah, today is going to be a fun day. I think we're just going to have a really kind of chill day. We're going to wander around the blue part of the city. We're going to visit a clock tower (Ghanta Ghar) and then maybe check out the market. And then have some lunch. Lunch. Lunch with a view. That is the plan. That is the plan. Hello puppy. Are you sleeping in a tuk-tuk? Yes, you are sleeping in a tuk-tuk. Are you supposed to be in there puppy? Yes. So right now we have ended up at the Sardar Market (सरदार बाजार) just around the clock tower (Ghanta Ghar). And I would say this is both a local market and a tourist market. You can get produce and like everyday things. Yeah, you see a lot of everyday like market stalls but you also see some more ones that are geared for tourists such as the ones where you can souvenirs, carpets and saris. Things like that. Yeah. But yeah, it is a busy market but we came early in the morning and it was kind of cool because we got to see how all of these different vendors were setting up their shops and as we walked around it started to definitely get a little busier. We're going to take a little break after visiting the market and walking around the city. So we found a restaurant called Indique. It is supposed to be one of the highest rated in the whole city so we're treating ourselves to a nice little splurge meal. I got myself a saffron lassi. Look at the color. It is a bright yellow. Stir it around. And I've only had saffron in savory dishes. This one is going to be sweet. Mmm. It is really good. So it is my turn. I'm trying the salty lassi here. Salted lassi. Oh wow. Yeah, that is definitely salty. So when you get lassis in India you can choose between salted, sweet and other kinds with different fruits. So the salted one is really good. That is probably my favorite. So the first restaurant we went to Indique was closed for lunch. So we only had drinks. Now we've found a place called Jhankar and they have an incredible courtyard so we're going to be having lunch in here. And yeah it is just really cool. It is quite lush. It looks tropical. And yeah let's go find our table. Mmm. How is that naan? It is so awesome. It is so buttery and garlic-y. Love it. Then, after all that food and drink, it was finally time to get lost in the blue maze that is Jodhpur (जोधपुर). It is all blue. So now it is time to answer the million dollar question. Why is Jodhpur (जोधपुर) painted blue? I actually had to google this one. And no one really knows the answer. There seems to be a whole bunch of different reasons. The most likely is that the color blue kind of deflects light so it keeps the homes cool during the summer months. And also it is believed that um a lot of Brahman followers of Lord Shiva used to live in Jodhpur (जोधपुर) so maybe that is why they decided to paint everything blue. But really it is a mystery. There was no definitive answer. So yeah, either way it looks pretty cool. Blue is a nice color. Hi little pup. Are you sleeping on a motorcycle? It looks like you are sleeping on a motorcycle and you know what? Earlier today I saw a pup sleeping in a tuk-tuk. Are you friends? Or are you the same pup? Oh you're cute. You have big silly ears. Big silly ears. Alright Sam. Sam Sam the man. Yeah. Yeah. First off all want to show us your new shirt? Oh yeah, love this new shirt. Got this in Jaisalmer. And I actually saw the artist like while he was painting. Yeah, it is hand painted. It is incredible. So cool. So cool. Anyways back on top. We're going out for dinner. We're hungry. We're going out for food. We ate at this place called Jhankar for lunch. Jhankar in Jodhpur (जोधपुर). Oh, it was so good Actually it was one of the best meals we've had in India so far. Yeah. So we are heading back there for dinner. And it is all about Thali (थाली) tonight. We are going to get an original Thali (थाली) and a Rajasthani Thali (राजस्थानी खाना). Because we are in Rajasthan (राजस्थान ਰਾਜਸਥਾਨ) and they have a special Thali so we can't wait to try that out. Now it is off to find a little tuk-tuk. Alright, lead the way. Lead the way. Tuk-tuk-y adventure! Tuk-tuk-tuk-tuk. We made friends with the Japanese guy who we were in Jaisalmer and he called them tuk-tukies. So that is what we call them to now. Tukie-tukies. Confession time. We already had lunch here and the food was so amazing that we've told the waiter right away we're coming back for dinner. So we decided to come and sample um local Thali (थाली). Rajasthani Thali. So that is what we've ordered. And also one thing I should mention this restaurant is run by a Jain family. So that means they are vegetarian and they don't eat any egg products. So yeah, we're going to be having a vegetarian meal today. Which is pretty cool. And apparently 70% of Rajasthan (राजस्थान ਰਾਜਸਥਾਨ) is vegetarian so the majority of the population do not eat meat. Which is pretty interesting. Come let's be friends. Meow meows. Come kitty. Meow meows. So we have found a kitty and we're trying to lure him over. There are not many cats in India. You know this is the first cat we've seen. Yeah, maybe it is. We've seen monkeys, we've seen cows, we've seen tonnes of dogs. But not a lot of cats. And I think this one is a pet. It is hanging out in the restaurant but it is a little skittish. It is a little shy. It is not coming quite close enough for us to pet. And now it left. It is gone. There it goes. Bye cat. Shizzam. The food has arrived. So they brought us over these two giants platters. And oh my goodness it is way bigger than I was expecting. Oh yeah. I don't know how Sam and I are going to eat all of this. It looks absolutely incredible. And we also got free desserts. So we've got our work cut out for us. So first up I'll show you my platter. I'm having the Rajasthani Thali set. So again it is vegetarian so lots of vegetable options going on. We've got some biryani rice, some mystery thick rice, some ghee which is kind of like curd or yoghurt. I think it is called ghee. Um, some more veggies with uh it looks like it has cashews. Cashew nuts. You know what I think we're just going to have to try it because I don't even know what I'm looking at right now. Yeah, they didn't list it on the menu. Yeah, so this is all a big surprise. Just dip it in. Break off a piece of bread. Oh, this looks like again all vegetable here. It is a vegetarian restaurant. I keep forgetting that. Mmm. How is that? Mmmm. What is it? This one reminds me of dal. Like a really spicy dal. Spicy huh? Lentil base. This one right here. My throat is on fire. Haha. Are you going to have some more of that? Urrghh. My throat is on fire. No. No. Okay moving on. Biryani with cauliflower. This is something we had for lunch. Oh, it was amazing. Tomatoes. Green peas. It is just so colorful. Like the way that they this is some of the best biryani. I would say it is the best vegetarian biryani rice I've ever had. Yeah. That is good. Okay Sam. And you have the he called it a Jimbo. A jumbo thali. I think this is a bit more of a classic Thali. So I'm just going to try everything. So I'll start off over here. Oh that looks good. I think there is cheese on the outside. Look at that. Oh wow. With curd. Oh my gosh that looks so good. I want some of that. Oooh. Oooh. That is some wonderful curry. It has got a bit of a tomato base. But really thick spicy, creamy. Oh my gosh. All the good things in life. All the good things in life. That is just amazing. And there is also chunks of the cottage cheese. I'm going in for another one. That was just so good. Another bite of the same thing. Oh yeah. That is when you know it is good. So that is a wrap from Jodhpur (जोधपुर). So we had a really good time in the Blue City. Um, it was only two days but I felt like we did quite a bit. Did you enjoy it? Yeah, the fort (मेहरानगढ़ का दुर्ग) was magnificent and the blue city was all it was supposed to be. Yes, so now we're moving on to Jaipur. We're just waiting at the train station. So we're going to catch our train. It is about a 6 hour journey. So relatively not too long but uh yeah can't wait to update you when we get there. Ciao for now. Ciao. Well good morning. Today we are in Jaipur (जयपुर). We're visiting the Pink City. Neither of us is wearing pink. No we were color coordinated for Jodhpur the Blue City but yeah I don't think we have anything pink in our wardrobe. Nothing pink. Maybe we'll pick something up today as a souvenir. Um but yeah today we have signed up for a full day tour from 9am to 6pm. And it is basically a bus tour that is going to be taking us to the main highlights in Jaipur (जयपुर). So busy day. And we don't have a lot of time in Jaipur (जयपुर) and this is a city I visited several years ago and I did this tour and attractions are really spread out here so I think this is going to be a good way for us to see everything along with my parents. And yeah, we don't we only have one really full day to do this. So yeah we are trying to cram in a lot today. So yeah let's get started. Alright the bus is here. Let's go. So we are finally off the bus. We drove around for about an hour picking up people. A little longer than I was expecting and we have arrived at our first stop. It is Laxmi Narayan Temple. A bit of a complicated name. And we only have 15 minutes here. So we've got to run around and visit this quickly. Also known as Birla Mandir, this is a Hindu temple, dedicated to Vishnu and Lakshmi. While Hindu deities are depicted inside the temple, the outside walls showcase figures from different faiths. Oh this 1st stop was quite rushed. We had 15 minutes but they force you to leave your shoes outside and pay for them. So it is like 5 minutes to drop them off because there is a really long line. Then maybe 5 minutes to actually visit the temple and then another 5 minutes to collect your shoes and rush back to the bus. So yeah, I hope the whole day isn't like this. But yeah I'm not too impressed so far. So Sam paid to go in to the temple. Actually well I just had to pay for the shoes yeah. 1 Rupee. Didn't exactly break the bank. What did you think of it? Yeah, it was an interesting temple. It is really large obviously marble and white. And inside you can't take photos or videos so unfortunately I can't show you what it is like inside. Womp womp. We then hopped back on the bus, drove past the Albert Hall Museum, and continued to the next stop on our itinerary: Jantar Mantar (जंतर मंतर). The name Jantar Mantar (जंतर मंतर) translates to ‘calculating instrument’, and it is a collection of 19 structures that date back to the 18th century. These instruments were used to predict eclipses, track stars, and measure time. So we are currently visiting Jantar Mantar (जंतर मंतर) and we're having a bit of hard time keeping up with our guide. But from what we gather this is basically like an observatory and it was used to track the movements of stars and planets and the sun and to study everything related to astronomy. So there is a lot of like really cool instruments. There is like these weird constructions so we're going to show you some of that. Is our guide around? From there it was just a short walk to the City Palace. Like most of the city, the palace is also painted pink, which is the colour of hospitality. This was done in 1876, to welcome the Prince of Wales and Queen Victoria when they did their India tour. Inside the palace complex, you can visit a museum and the armoury, or just walk around snapping photos. So Sam ditched the tour group to go shopping. I did because I've been like in the past I collected hats and I still do but these days I'm collecting polo shirts. And India has the coolest polo-shirts. This is like the um Jaipur different colors. I saw a very similar shirt of like an old polo shirt in one of the museums and it looks so much like this. So I'm really happy to get this colorful one. And then of course Jaipur (जयपुर). Jaipur is the pink city. Oh la lah. I can't to wear those. So I've already got Jodhpur and yeah I'm going to keep collecting them. Hopefully I can get one in Kolkata as well. That is going to be coming up soon. So we have ditched the guide for now but he knows we're going to meet him at the exit and this is so much better. We're just walking around freely, enjoying the city palace and check out these colors. Everything is pink and outlined with white designs. It is really really cool. So yeah, I'm having a good time even if I'm not enjoying the tour necessarily. We have ended up at a place called Shopping Paradise. I'm pretty sure we're only here because the guide gets commission. So he's trying to force everyone to come in. Even though some people have already been shopping. So yeah. Not impressed. So we are now at the Jaigarh Fort (जयगढ़ क़िला). This is again a very quick visit. So we basically have 20 minutes to see as much as we can. Uh, you get some pretty cool views of the area. But the landscape is quite barron. Uh, so yeah we're just going to have a quick walk around. From the Jaigarh Fort (जयगढ़ क़िला) it was a short drive to Nahargarh Fort and Palace. I wish I could tell you we got to see a bit of the palace, but as you’ve probably already noticed, the theme of the day was rush, rush, rush, so we grabbed a quick bite of food and carried on. Hungry. I am. So we got pav bhaji (पाव भाजी). I think that is what it is called. I'm guessing the pao comes from the Portuguese influence. Pao is bread in Portuguese. And the bhaji came with cheese. I don't even know what this is but it has got melted cheese on top. Should I add some red onions? Sure. I'm going to have some onion breath all day. And Sam is sitting next to me. So lucky me. How is that? Mmmm. Tasty. It is like a sloppy Joe. Indian sloppy Joe. That is a good way of putting it. So we just finished lunch and now we're visiting Nahargarh Fort and Palace. We're just wandering around aimlessly because the guide has disappeared again. We didn't want to eat at the restaurant he was taking us to. Um because it was really expensive so we had a fast food instead. Um, yeah right now we're visiting one of the old step wells and it is pretty cool. People would have liked to climbed down the stairs to go fetch water. You can see that behind me. And yeah we only have a few more minutes left here so we're going to try and see as much as we can before we move on. But the tour is almost over. I think we only have like 2 or 3 more stops for today. And then that is it. We then hopped back on the bus to go visit our third fort of the day: the Amer Fort (आमेर क़िला). On the way down, we got a quick glimpse at Jal Mahal, the Lake Palace, which sits in the middle of Man Sagar Lake. We noticed there were men with row boats, so if you visit with a bit more time, that’s an activity to consider. Next stop of the day is the Amber Fort (आमेर क़िला). It is a little backlit at the moment. But there you have it in the background and there is Sam taking some photos. What do you think? This is your second time here. Well we've been to quite a few forts today so we decided not to take the jeep all the way up. Instead we noticed there was some nice light coming down from the ground level and from the lake. So here we are. We're exploring it this way instead. By foot. Making friends Audrey. Yes. Who is this. My new friend. My pup. Hello fur buddy. Hello pup. Hello fur friend. The little fur friend. Fur friend is feeling shy. Hello fur friend. Hello. Hello fur friend. The rest of the day went downhill quickly when our guide started making commissioned based shopping stops that weren’t on the itinerary, so we just stopped filming, but we got back into Jaipur (जयपुर) well after dark. Well it is now time to wrap up our time in Jaipur (जयपुर). Yeah, so confession time. We're actually in Agra right now. Whoops. Got on a train yesterday. Got on a train yesterday. Uh the day after our tour we just chilled out. We didn't film at all because the tour was kind of exhausting. It was. It really was. It really was. It just ended up going on for an hour and a half longer than it was supposed to and it was already a long tour. And it was mostly shopping stops at the end. Yeah, so like in terms of because there is all of the different forts so spread out it is not a bad way to see them but at the same time you are very rushed and you go to so many different places I almost think doing it independently would be a little bit better. That would be our tip. But anyways yeah the adventures here in Agra are about to begin so do follow us for that. Bye. Bye. Well good morning good morning. Today we are in Agra (आगरा). How excited are you? Super excited. I mean 'hey guess what' there is a little kind of tiny attraction here we might be visiting. Maybe the Taj Mahal (ताजमहल). Maybe, we might work in a little time for that. Still haven't figured it out but. Okay, so here is the deal. The Taj Mahal (ताजमहल) is actually closed on Fridays and we didn't realize that until we got here. So we can't visit today but instead we're going to visit Agra Fort (आगरा का किला). Yeah. And maybe the Baby Taj Mahal. Yeah, and the good news is that I've actually been to Agra (آگرہ) before and I've been to Agra Fort (आगरा का किला) and it is one of the most impressive I've ever visited in India. If this fort was outside of Agra (आगरा) it would be a standalone attraction in another city. So we're going to go check that out today and maybe check out the Taj from across the river. And then we have to buy tickets for the Taj. Can't forget that. Right so busy day actually. Let's begin. Agra Fort (आगरा का किला) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that draws big numbers, especially on a Friday when the Taj is closed. Admission to Agra Fort (आगरा का किला) is through the Amar Singh Gate, which is the south gate. Outside the gates you’ll find guides offering their services, so that’s something you can keep in mind if you’re looking to learn about the fort’s history and architecture. So we've been getting all of these like teaser views of the Taj. Last night we had it during dinner and today we have this. And I think we're going to get one more vantage point later on in the day. And then finally tomorrow we actually visit it. Once you walk through a series of gates, you’ll find yourself in a giant complex of marble palaces, inner courtyards and gardens, complete with wild monkeys running along the fort’s walls. You also get some pretty cool views of the Taj Mahal (ताजमहल) off in the distance - but we’ll show you an even better lookout point later in this video. So we think this lady is a gardener because it looks like she is picking weeds but she's also taking a little break at the same time. Just pulling out some grass. Well good evening. We are back from our day of sightseeing at the fort. Our hotel room is a little bit messy for a tour right now but we're going to head downstairs because we're having dinner and we're actually doing a homestay so they just finished cooking up something really nice. So yeah we're going to share a meal with all of the other guests and it should be good. Let's go. Well Sam are you ready for dinner? Ready for dinner! Always ready for dinner. How hungry are you? Always. I'm in hungry hippo mode. Hungry hippo mode. Let's go down. We stayed at The Coral Court Homestay which is a beautiful property run by a very kind and attentive couple, and one of the highlights of that stay was the food. We had the most delicious vegetarian curries made with eggplant, pumpkin, and paneer, and I’m still thinking about those meals to this day! Well good morning. Today is finally the big day. The big day. It is Saturday the Taj is open again. We got our tickets this morning. Sam was up at seven in the morning. My Dad and I we went and grabbed them and yeah. So then we had a nice leisurely breakfast. So we decided not to go right at sunset. We decided to take it a little bit easy but now we're here and really excited to go inside. Let's go in. So first impressions we've only just entered through the East Gate and we're already like wow. We haven't even seen the Taj yet but the buildings leading up to it are exquisite so I can't wait to see the Taj itself. The Taj Mahal (ताजमहल) was built by Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th child in 1631. He wrote that the beauty of the structure made “the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes”, and while I may not have shed a tear, it’s a sight that did not disappoint. So it is not a very long walk from the entrance to the Taj but we've been taking our time slowly meandering taking lots of family photos and selfies. So we are finally here now we're going to go drop our shoes off and finally enter the Taj Mahal (ताजमहल). Okay, so we got these fancy little shoe covers to wear. Um, once we step on to the Taj Mahal (ताजमहल). So let's put these on. So classy. Do they fit your big feet? Hahaha. Yep. They do fit but man this is just going to look really funny. There is one. They look like elf shoes. Urgh. Look at that. There is the other. Parade around in them. Tada. Show me your elf shoes? Da da dah. Elf shoes. Forward. Let's go in. We're going to cover up them crocs and socks. Crocs and socks. Crocs and socks and shoe covers. Oh la lah. Now let's show off the full outfit. Oh yeah. Sam looks like he is going skiing. I'm ready. Ready? We've only been here for 2 hours he says. Alright, let's do some thoughts from the Taj Mahal (ताजमहल). Sam has been here before. Yeah, this is my second time. Well the 1st thing that I want to talk about is uh it is so nice visiting it healthy. The last time I came here I had food poisoning and I kind of had to drag myself here on the final day that I was in Agra (आगरा). So it was really nice coming here feeling healthy and being able to just walk around and take it in slowly. That has been really nice. And it is one of the those attractions that lives up to the hype. It does. Yes. Some places you visit in person and you're like 'ugh' womp womp. Not as amazing as I would have hoped but the Taj Mahal (ताजमहल) is simply incredible and the thing that I really think is cool is that when you view it from different vantage points, up close, from the side, from behind. From inside the complex, the outside of the complex say on a rooftop. It is just incredible from just about anywhere and it is one of those sites that is just so worth visiting. So we are doing lunch with a view once again. Check it out. We've got the Taj Mahal (ताजमहल). After visiting the Taj, we exited through the South Gate and found a restaurant that boasts one of the best views in town: Saniya Palace Restaurant. The food took a long time to come and it was decent, but we were really here for the views. The danger of standing under trees. A bird just pooped in front of me. It missed me by like a centimeter or two. But anyways hello. Hello. It is day 3 in Agra (آگرہ) and today we're actually taking the night train to Varanasi. Yep. So we have all day. So yeah we're basically killing time. We did the two main things we wanted to do. Obviously to go to the Taj and we also wanted to go to Agra Fort (आगरा का किला). So today there is a couple cool things that we've got planned. We're going to be doing a nature walk. Taj Nature Walk. And it is right by the East Gate of the Taj. Yep. It was only 100 Rupees to get a ticket so that is pretty cool. And then later on today we're hoping to catch sunset from the Baby Taj (Tomb of I'timād-ud-Daulah - اعتماد الدولہ کا مقبر). So overlooking the Taj. So yeah, it should be pretty awesome. Alright, let's go enjoy the walk and avoid bird poop hopefully. So this nature walk is located just east of the Taj Mahal (ताजमहल) and that means we get some pretty cool views. And we've spotted a peacock. Hello peacock. Hello. What did we just see? We saw a peacock. Are you going to sing Katy Perry Peacock for us. No, I'm not. You keep making me try to do that. Haha. The Taj Nature Walk is one of Agra’s (आगरा) best-kept secrets and we only learned about it thanks to our homestay family. This nature walk was a stark contrast to Agra’s (آگرہ) busy streets and we hardly saw anyone there, save for a few couples enjoying the views. If you have time for it, I would suggest going in the morning when the light hits the Taj just right. It’s one of the best lookout points in Agra (आगरा). Alright, so that was a really fun walk. I think we all enjoyed it. Yeah, we had some a lot of fun making silly poses you know by the Taj and it was just really quiet and chill. And after you know a really busy day at the Taj yesterday it was nice to kind of have a relaxing moment here at the park. Later that afternoon we went to visit the Baby Taj (Tomb of I'timād-ud-Daulah - اعتماد الدولہ کا مقبر), which is a white marble mausoleum covered in semi-precious stones. This structure was built for the grandfather of Mumtaz Mahal, and she is the woman the Taj Mahal (ताजमहल) was built for. There are pigeons inside the tomb. Last afternoon in town. Sam is filming and I am interrupting his shot. Come join the frame. So we made it to the Baby Taj Mahal (Tomb of I'timād-ud-Daulah - اعتماد الدولہ کا مقبر). We're here. It is different from the Taj. How would you describe it? Oh, it is so much smaller. It is a lot smaller. Yeah, it would be worth coming here first I would say rather than what we're doing at the end. Are you feeling underwhelmed? It is a little underwhelming after you've seen the Taj to be honest. But I mean we are killing time waiting for the trains so we're lucky to have a few things left to do. Yeah, I've noticed this one has a lot of designs and geometric patterns on the exterior. It is a lot more elaborate. Yep. As opposed to the Taj Mahal (ताजमहल). That is one of the cool things. Also there is far fewer people here. So it is nice to just be able to walk around and have it more to yourself. So our last stop of the day is the Mehtab Gardens (मेहताब बाग़ - مہتاب باغ‎,) which are directly behind the Taj Mahal (ताजमहल) so you get some pretty cool views. The Taj is hiding just behind us over there. Just over there and unfortunately we can't stay until sunset when it is supposed to be spectacular. It is uh we're a couple of hours away from that but we still thought we'd come and check it out anyways. Yeah, so that is a wrap from Agra (आगरा). We've really enjoyed our time here and there is definitely a lot more to see than just the Taj and hopefully we were able to show you just a little bit of that. And yeah, next up is Varanasi so see you soon. We've got a long train ride ahead. Ciao for now. Bye. Alright guys it is our second last destination here in India. We have finally made it to Varanasi (वाराणसी) and this is our first morning exploring the ghats. Yeah and this is one of the must visit destinations that we planed in our itinerary. I visited back in 2010 and it is a fascinating place to visit. It is the kind of place where you don't really have a set schedule you just kind of wander around the ghats and take it all in. And at different times of day there is different types of things happening. So it is one of those places that you just return to all throughout the day and something fascinating is always going on here. Yeah and I mean we've been here in the morning for just maybe a little under an hour and we have seen so much already. There is people doing laundry, there is like people having their breakfast, there is goats wandering around. There is people bathing in the Ganges. People are bathing. There burning ghats are already are happening. People are being cremated basically so there is a lot going on and it is just a lot to take in so it is the kind of place where you stroll around slowly and you stop frequently. Ghats is the word used to describe the steps that lead down to the river’s edge. There are a total of 87 ghats in Varanasi (वाराणसी), some bigger than others, but we just focused on a handful, starting at Dashashwamedh Ghat (दशाश्वमेध घाट) and working our way down. Along the way we saw former palaces built by royal families, cheap guesthouses that cater to backpackers, and plenty of temples. So when we were in Agra a few days ago I overheard a few girls saying how they had been in Varanasi (وارانسی) and they refused to get any laundry done because they saw people doing laundry on the Ganges river. And I thought okay they are probably exaggerating. That doesn't actually happen. But now we're out here and we're seeing hotel bed sheets and hotel towels being washed by hand in the river and I have to say I'm kind of horrified. I probably will not be handing in any laundry while I'm here. Just a bit further downstream we came to Manikarnika Ghat (मणिकर्णिका घाट), also known as the Burning Ghat, where bodies are cremated. Hindus believe that cremation on the banks of the Ganges River can break the cycle of reincarnation, which is why many choose to die here. If you decide to visit the Burning Ghat, be aware that camera use is not allowed and you’ll have to keep your distance. As lively as the Ganges is by day, we also made time to visit by night so we could watch the Ganga Aarti ceremony. This is a fire worship ceremony that takes place at Dashashwamedh Ghat (दशाश्वमेध घाट), with lots of singing, chanting, burning candles and billowing incense. You can watch the ceremony from the steps or aboard the boats for a small fee, but either way, you’ll want to arrive early to claim a spot as it gets very busy. Okay so we made it down to the ghats. It looks like the ceremony is about to begin. But we got Sam's parents some seats up on a balcony by the temple so they're going to get great views. They're like VIP seats. We paid 50 Rupees each. 50 Rupees and we're going to run around and film like crazy. So see you in a bit. Sam are you dancing with them? (Singing and dance music) So one of my favorite things to do here in Varanasi (वाराणसी) is just wander around like go exploring through the old town is just like a labyrinth, it is like a maze. There is so much people watching. There is a lot of animals, there is a lot of cows. There is also a lot of opportunity to shop as well so I'm going to show you some of that. So I don't know if you guys can hear this but we're standing by the window here in our hotel room and the honking never ends. You know what? I would love to just get uh a thing of popcorn and sit right down here because this is like the best entertainment ever. Oh my gosh. Just outside. It is absolute madness. Like pan to this. Show what is going on. I feel like I'm slowly losing my mind. There is honking from sun up to sun down. It never ends. This is probably one of the busiest like intersection roundabouts in the city because we're really close to some of the main ghats and there is just a lot of all-kind-of-things happening here. I mean you see cows, you see people, you see autorickshaws. You see peddle rickshaws. There is vehicles. It is absolute madness. I'm going to go down on street level and capture some of that for you. Yeah, and Sam is going by himself because there is no way I'm subjecting myself to that. It is a solo mission. Solo mission. Bye. (Street noises and honking) Ah, no thank you. Oh my gosh that cow is still there. This is going to be the best timelapse ever. It has just been eating from the same thing. You seem friendly. Do you want little pets. I don't have food but I can give you little pets. Hello cow. Hello cow. Hello. Lastly, it wouldn’t have been a proper trip to Varanasi (वाराणसी) without taking a boat ride down the Ganges River. We were up before the crack of dawn to meet our boatman, and our early morning wake up call was rewarded with one of the best sunrises we saw in India. So confession time. We were the only two willing to wake up this early and get out on a boat. So I think we deserve a few brownie points for that. Yeah. Huh? Maybe even a Snickers bar. Maybe a Snickers bar. We bought a whole bunch of Snickers bars to take on the train later today. So yeah, we definitely deserve this but it is pretty special moment. Like never in my wildest dreams would I think you know the two of us would be out here in India out on the ghats in Varanasi (وارانسی) but yet here we are. It is pretty awesome huh? It is really neat no matter what time of day you come down here. There is always something going on and you know you come down at peak times you'll see a festival. Yeah. Or early in the morning or late at night. Yeah, exactly. And we've been exploring at all times of day so this has been really cool and we're just kind of wrapping things up here. We've got a train to catch to Kolkata later today. So yeah, our last time here at the ghats. Yeah it is I'm going to be a little sad to leave them actually. I know it has been a great experience. And it has been really cool uh traveling with you guys too. Yeah, well it is always special traveling with you two. I know that. Ah, it is like having two personal guides along at the same time. Haha. With a lot of knowledge. So we're wrapping things up here in Varanasi (वाराणसी) at the train station. We've done all of our train travel in India by trains so it is kind of appropriate that our very last journey to Calcutta is by train. So yeah, we're just our train has been delayed by four hours so we've just been waiting a really long time and now we're getting ready to board. Hopefully it is coming soon. Well good morning from Kolkata. We have made it to our final destination in India. Final stop. We're kind of all dropping like flies. Oh my goodness. My Mom is really sick. Yes. You've been really sick for a few days. Luckily I've been okay. Sam's okay. I got sick about five days ago and I've been okay the past few days. My Dad is kind of got a bit of a cold. He's so-so. So we're kind of just all barely hanging in there. So I went missing halfway through the Varanasi vlog so Sam continued on without me. I spent our last day in Varanasi just puking my guts out and I'm slowly on the mend but I'm still not well enough to go sightseeing today. So Sam is going to show you around Calcutta with his Dad. Yep. Which should be a fun adventure. And he's actually knocking on the door right now. So I'll let him in. So time to go sightseeing with Sam and George. We didn’t venture too far on our first day. Our hotel was located in Colootola just east of the maidan, so we mostly wandered the park on foot and watched a bit of cricket, before heading down to Victoria Memorial. So the one thing you'll notice if you're touring around Kolkata just on foot is just how popular cricket is here in this city. It is just everywhere you go, anytime there is a park or an open space you'll see a bunch of men playing cricket. So next up we're visiting Victoria Memorial Hall and to visit the garden it is like the cost of a cup of chai on a train in India. It is only 10 Rupees. So yeah, it is really to go in. If you want to go visit the museum it is 200 but we're uh a little tired today so we're just going to walk around the premises and take some shots. The Victoria Memorial was built to commemorate Queen Victoria after her passing, and it officially opened in 1921. Inside they have a collection of Indian paintings and Western paintings, as well as rare photographs, old manuscripts and coin collections. So just a short outing this morning. Yeah, we just uh got tired by the heat and humidity didn't we? It is really hot. The humidity. It was killer today. It was a lot worse than what we've been used to so it just drained us. I think it is like low 30s. Sorry low to mid 30s so yeah we're just going to head back. We're going to get some lunch and then maybe this afternoon we'll explore a bit more. Maybe by rickshaw. Yep. I am back. I feel like I'm rejoining the vlog towards the end. But I'm finally feeling well enough. I don't sound amazing but I'm not puking so bonus points. Anyways today is our last day in Kolkata. We just said goodbye to Sam's parents this morning. We're flying out tomorrow. So we're going to do some sightseeing. It is almost sunset time so we're thinking of doing a rickshaw tour around part of the city. And uh ooh in our room this is the mystery. We saw a creature scuttling across the floor. And we haven't been able to figure out if it is a gecko or a mouse. We have two pieces of evidence. We saw geckos in Sam's parents room and they were like crawling on the walls but then I also found mouse droppings underneath my pillow. So it could be either of the two creatures. Sam is not impressed in the background. He's like Rrrr. I'm hoping it is a gecko because I'm personally afraid of mice. He's hoping it is a gecko. If I find. If I found a mouse I think I'm going to freak out. Yeah, so I think I'm going to be packing the bags. Um tonight and just shaking everything out and make sure we're not taking a mouse back home to Canada because that wouldn't be good. But anyways let's go sightsee around Kolkata. With only two of us remaining, we went out for a little walk around our neighbourhood. We found some street art, took photos of the iconic yellow cabs, watched a game of cricket on the street, and then befriended a sweet dog along the way. Pup. Of course you're sweet. Every dog is sweet here. Yes, I'm just looking for food. Just looking for treats. Oooh. Look at you. You have nice eyes. (Street noises) Who thinks Sam should get one of the outfits right behind him. Yes. No. I would vote for the Aladdin pants. The Gold Aladdin pants. Burgundy shirt. Oh yeah. So visiting the Sir Stuart Hogg Market was a bit of a bust. We were basically surrounded by a group of people who just wanted to sell us stuff and take us to their shops. And I mean you do get hassled quite a bit in India but it is usually just like one or two people trailing along. Not like being encircled by men. So I think we're going to ditch the market and wander on foot. So forget shopping. We had enough of that. Change of plans. So now we're going to try and get some well maybe the best views in our neighborhood. We found a rooftop bar that is on the 9th floor. Yeah, I think it is called Blue and Beyond. And this is awesome. It is 5:20 right now and sun sets at five forty so I think we're coming at just the right time. Perfect timing. Perfect timing. Well this is a fancy hotel. I bet they don't have any mice here like in our hotel. We clearly should have stayed at the Lindsay. Now let's go to the bar. So it is a bit overcast. We didn't get a magical sunset. But we did get food. It is pretty good. We have a meze platter with pita, hummus, babaganoush and falafel. Iced tea and Sam is already digging in. It was quite overcast in Kolkata that day so we didn’t get a great sunset, but it was still a nice spot to cool off with a drink and see the city from a different vantage point. Okay so we're doing a pulled rickshaw tour. And you're already on. How do you feel? Check this out. Wow. (Street sounds) We are doing a tour by pull rickshaw because apparently these are typical of Kolkata. Yep. And Sam was very adamant about it. This was the one thing he wanted to do. And I feel pretty bad because we're these two plump foreigners. Yeah, we're a bit of a heavy load but I mean I have a lot of respect for these drivers. They work hard to earn a living. Yeah. And we're definitely paying tourist prices and we're also going to give him a tip. A really big tip. So I feel bad but I guess this is what you do in Kolkata. Alright guys that is a wrap from Kolkata. We are all packed up and ready to go. So yeah that is basically the end of our journey in India and what a journey it was. Oh my gosh like yeah. It has been a crazy month. It has been a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows but see you next time. Tata. Bye. We hope you enjoyed our India travel guide and that it gave you a good idea of attractions and things to do on your own trip.

We had a bit of a late night last night singing Karaoke with friends. But it is our last day in the city so we need to go out and sightseeing. So we're starting off the morning with a traditional breakfast. So if you have a look down here we've just ordered coffee. Coffee with milk. Pretty simple. I've also got my Pão de queijo. And that is a big one! And that is a massive one. So this is the cheese bread made with the manioc flower. Yes, and here comes the other part. This is the bread that has been cooked in butter, right? It's like the toast. Okay, so can you tell us how pão na chapa is made? So basically the keep it really simple here in Brasil which is kind of cool. It's just your bread, cooked on a pan with butter. It is really simple but it looks really tasty. Yeah. But it is so nice and buttery and like the bread is flaky. It is like a French bread. They must put a lot of butter on there. Yeah, that's really nice. But you know what I do wish they had a bit of jam. Like this bread with a bit of strawberry jam would just be magic. You know what I would put cream cheese on mine. Cream cheese? With a dollop of strawberry jam on top. Oh. Now that is the winning combo. Oh, look at that. It is so cheesy inside. This is amazing. Because you know what we've been going to a place called Case de Pão de queijo. And over there you get like these tiny little balls that are just like bite sized. But this is like a proper gigantic. The is the grand daddy of them all. That is bigger than our hand. Yeah, and see if you can get the texture of this. Just look at that. It is so cheesy. Oh. How is that? That is good. Perfecto? That is authentic. Yeah. It is like really chewy because of all the cheese in there. Nice and starchy. It is good stuff. This is what I'm going to miss when we leave today. Pão de queijo. Alright, time to try the coffee. Wow. It is really sweet isn't it. Really really sweet. There is a pile of sugar added. I like it. I'm loving the coffee. I like it too. I usually have my coffee black but this is a nice jolt of energy in the morning. It tastes more like a dessert coffee. And now this is completely unrelated to breakfast but you saw cocada. I saw the cocada and this is like our favorite coconut slash snack slash dessert and it is basically just coconut and whole bunch of sugar and maybe a little bit of milk. Look at this thing of beauty. It's like a coconut bar. Oh man, that is so good. This has nothing to do with breakfast but I'm already eating sweets for breakfast. Why not? You just couldn't resist it. It's your last day in Sao Paulo. You may as well enjoy it. I'm doing whatever I want. So we just paid the bill and Sam is over the moon because that was amazing value. Such cheap food. It was 16.25 Reals which is like less than $5 dollars. All of that food and I got an extra coffee. I mean we had three coffees, we had the two basically the two pastries, the two breads and then we had the cocado. So that is amazing. I'm full, I'm ready to go. I'm on a sugar high. Let's get the day started. Woo hoo! Let's go. Yeah. Hahaha. So it is our very first lunch here in Rio de Janeiro so we thought let's go for the classic grill. We are eating at a Churrascaria. And I'm probably making that sound a little bit more Spanish than Portuguese but basically it is a grill house and you just eat steaks and meats. And the waiters are going to be coming around to the table with like these giant rotisserie sticks and they just basically slice the meat on to your plate. So pretty cool, we're paying a fixed few. A flat rate and that also gives us access to a salad bar and we get sides. And free non-alcoholic drinks. So we're going to be eating lots of food today basically. Sounds good to me. So aside from the salad bar and all of the meat you can get here we are also able to choose a few sides. So we can try. What are we going to pick? Good question. How about fried manioc flour? Yeah. Do you want a bit of that? I'm up for anything. And you like fried bananas? Yes. So let's go for some of that. Okay, so first up the salads. Yeah, take a look at my plate. And you'll see that I've got a whole bunch of different assorted salads. A lot of them have mango which is really exciting. Some of them have cheese. I see some it looks like quinoa, brown rice. So super healthy and I'm trying not to load up on to much of those because the star of the meal will be arriving soon and that is the shaved meat. What did you just get served? So the meat has already arrived and I think we're starting with chicken. So let's take a look at this one. And I can tell already that this has been a sweet glaze or something over top of it. That looks so good. I can smell. It smells a bit like honey. The aromas. If only we had smell-o-vision. If only we had smell-o-vision. Sorry guys. You're missing out here. Future technology. Wow. Wow. Wow. Super tender meat. Yeah. And it has been, it kind of has a honey glaze coating over top of it. It seems a little bit marinated. I tried it too. It is so good. And you also got sausage on your plate. Little bit of chorizo. Super tasty. Wanna go for that? Yeah, why not? Cut us a piece. A mini chorizo. Look at that. Nice and pink. Mmmmm. He's in heaven. Wow. That's almost as good as the Argentinian stuff. Ho ho. Almost. So I think this is quite clever. At the table they leave these little cards and basically you can flip it if you're full and you no longer want any meat. You just show the red side and then if you do want more meat you show the green side. And you just leave it like that and the waiter comes around and he just keeps bringing you different cuts. So we are nowhere close to tapping out yet. We just started. This has just begun. Alright, time to try the meat. The star of the meal. Oh, that is good. Yeah? Yeah. It is really tender. Nice and tender and also really salty. You can tell they've added a lot of salt but not a lot of other seasonings or anything else. It is very simple. Very simple. They're keeping it salty, nicely cooked too. It is a little bit pink in the middle. That is cool. That way the flavor of the meat can really shine through. Exactly. And let's talk about our sides that have arrived. We have our fried plantain which you are a huge fan of. And we also the farofa which is the fried manioc flour. So do you want to try that for the first time? Yeah, so you just bite into it? Is that how you eat it? Well, try not to choke on it. I think you're supposed to mix it in with like your rice or your beans. On its own it is probably not that spectacular. Yeah, it definitely needs to be added to something. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that golden plantain. I know, I'm so excited to try this. I really got hooked on these when we were in the Peruvian jungle nearby Iquitos. And so to have it again here in Brazil is a real treat. Yeah. And actually fried banana or fried plantain is a popular dessert in Asia so we ate it quite a bit over there as well. And this is awesome. This is the way I like it. Really really sweet. Really ripe and it is almost a bit syrupy on the outside. It is wonderful. Hahahaha. They have come around with meat probably five or six times. Give us a status update. How are you feeling? Status update is I'm feeling very satisfied in terms of the taste and man am I ever getting stuffed. I think I've hit my quota. It is time to flip over to the red card. Is this Picanha? Si. Okay, Sam get one. Si. Ah, obrigado. So this one is Picanha. So let's just dig in to that. Oh my gosh, I already said I was full and the food just keeps coming. It is amazing though. It is too good not to eat it. That is so juicy inside. Wow, look at that. Look how red that is. Woah! Oh, that is the best one yet. Yeah, best cut so far? Oh yeah. Alright guys try the Picanha when it comes around. And the filet mignon. There it is. Because we don't get enough meat. Major meat sweats happening right now? I swear by the time I'm done this. This will probably be the last meal of the day. And I'm thinking I made need to fast tomorrow. This is getting to the very advanced stages of a pig out. So I believe that is a meal you're going to remember for a long time. Yes, wouldn't you say? Very long time. Yeah, it was like fantastic. The quality of the meat was so good. And the service was so attentive. They kept checking up on us to see if we had enough meat, to see if we had enough of our mains and also the salad bar was really cool. There is a lot of really inventive salads so this overall was like just an absolute fantastic meal. And let's talk about the price now. And the price was also really reasonable. So it came to 79 Reals. So you're looking at just roughly over 20 US dollars. I think 22 US dollars for that meal and that included all of the meat, all of the salad and drinks as well. So really good meal. I mean that was the equivalent, I probably ate the equivalent of four meals just here now. So it is time for a rest. I'm just beyond stuffed. And here is a tip. Have a small breakfast. Yeah. If you're planning to come here. Or even skip it. Look at that. So we just arrived in Sao Paulo's Municipal Market. It is lunchtime. We were starving and we saw that they have these amazing Mortadella sandwiches. Have a look at this. This is a monster. As I was approaching the table Sam was like 'Wow'. You know what, I haven't seen a sandwich that big since we've had it from Katz's in New York City. Do you remember the pastrami sandwiches we had there? Amazing! And this place is called Hocca bar. I think I'm pronouncing that right in Portuguese. Hocca. Hocha? So yeah, there is a huge line here, the place is packed and we've ordered the sandwich that is called Bellissimo. If you have a look here it is thick amounts of Mortadella, some melted cheddar cheese and also sun-dried tomatoes in there. And like a fluffy white bun. Like French bread. Ah, you know what. Let's dig in. That's going to be hard to bite in to. Alright, time to tackle this. Okay, so let's try to dip it into this spicy pepper sauce. Like this is so gooey and greasy. Oh, look at the cheese! Look at the cheese. Wow! Crazy. So good. Yeah? So, good. Also their sauce is quite spicy. A lot spicier than I was expecting. So I'm like burning in my throat. Your tongue is on fire. It is just so juicy, I know I keep saying this but look at that. It's like oozing juice and grease and it is just the bread is sopping it all up. My gosh. One more bite and then I'll share. Are you ready for this? I'm ready. So I'm going to try a little bit of the sauce too. Oh, big bite. Big bite. Hahahaha. I got more sauce on the side of my mouth than I did inside of my mouth. But how is the sandwich? But you're right. Delicious. Like just such massive amounts of meat. Yeah. Like I said the only other place that I've had this much meat has been in Katz's in New York and Schwartz's in Montreal. So now we've found a third place in the world that serves meat like this. Yeah. Incredible. Here in Sao Paulo. Have another bite. And you are right. That sauce is ridiculously spicy. I'm going one without the sauce this time. Oh man. That is so good. Yeah. I don't know if you can see this but like there is juice dripping down from this meat. Yes. Yes, there is. Look at this. There. That's awesome. That's one heck of a sandwich. Well, as usual we took care of that. How are you feeling? That was a greasy feast for the ages. I am feeling stuffed. One sandwich is totally enough for two people. Yeah, if you can fish the whole sandwich you're either ridiculously hungry or you're a bit of a pig to be honest. Alright, and price wise this was just under nine dollars. Yeah, nine dollars. So I'd say pretty good value. About 30 something Reals. So yeah, really good value and bring a friend. Bring a friend. That is the number one tip. So it has been pouring rain in Rio de Janeiro ever since we got here and we haven't been able to do a whole lot of sightseeing out in the city. Today we have come to Confeitaria Colombo and this place is considered one of the ten most beautiful cafes in the whole world. And if you just take a look around me it is kind of like a French Belapox style with Art Nouveau. They have these huge mirrors that came all of the way from Belgium and it just feels like you've traveled back in time here. Also, they've had a lot of really distinguished guests. Like Kings, Queens, Presidents. Yeah. So I feel pretty special sitting here. Queen Elizabeth has come here and apparently almost all of the Brazilian presidents have frequented at some point in time. A popular spot. Indeed. So what? Mint. You chose mint? I chose mint. I'm all about the green tea. That is perfect because we're having so much chocolate the mint will go very well with that. Need to digest it. Just melt it. So this video is going to be all about a popular Brazilian dessert known as Brigadeiro. And this is the classic form right here. So I was asking our waiter about it and he basically said it is milk and chocolate kind of like cooked over a very very low heat and then you let it cool down and harden. And then you basically scoop it up with a spoon, make it into little balls and then you roll it in chocolate sprinkles. You can see over here. So that looks super decadent to me. So friends this is for chocolate lovers. Oh, yes. So I'm going to dig right in. Oh, look at that. It is almost like a thick fudge. Like I don't know if you can see the detail here. How I pulled it out but it is so so thick. Man. Mmmmm. Wow. Decadent? Oh my gosh. It's almost like peanut butter, like that same texture, but it is all chocolate. I can see why they give you very small amounts of it. Because it just like you really need to chew it slowly and savor it. It is so good. Is it really sweet too? Hahahaha. It is good stuff. So it is now Sam's turn to have his first bite of Brigadeiro. Yes, and I am so excited to try this. Like I've hardly had any kind of Brazilian food in my life before, so everything that we're eating is new in these food videos is completely new. And yeah, like I mean it is even heavy in the fork. Yeah, it is so thick. I know. Wow. What do you think? You're right it is thick like peanut butter. It is almost thick in the same sense almost a little bit like fudge too. Yeah. And it is extremely decadent. It is so rich and chocolate-y and creamy. Like it is amazing. Like we're going to have so much fun eating all three of these different things. So aside from the chocolate one we also ordered a Brigadeiro made out of coffee. So this looks a little bit different. Yeah, so I've already cut it up here and it has a totally different consistency. The chocolate one is a bit more like kind of like peanut butter like a spread. Yeah, it is smoother. Yeah but this one hear is crumbly. Ooh. Let's have a taste of that. Yeah. Oh. Wow. The coffee flavor doesn't hit you until you've been chewing it for a few bites. Yeah. Wow. It is like so potent. So flavorful. Yeah and I also noticed that it has shredded coconut on the exterior. Yeah, it does. That looks pretty good. Like the other one it is really dense and really filling. Yeah. Like these balls look small but I'm sure that if you finish a whole one you're going to be pretty stuffed afterwards. So do you have a preference - chocolate or coffee - which is better? No, I don't have a preference. I like them equally. What I want to do is alternate between the two of them. One bite of each. That is the plan. So aside from ordering Brigadeiro we also got Brigadeiro cake. So if you take a look here this is kind of like a chocolate cake with three layers. That is three layers of cake right there. And we've got the Brigadeiro cream kind of spread in between. And the chocolate sprinkles on the side. Can't forget the sprinkles. Mmmmmm. Wow. That is like a very fluffy yet moist chocolate cake. And the Brigadeiro spread is also a lot creamier. It is not so thick. So yeah, that is a really nice combination. So like pretty much best chocolate cake ever? Yeah. You can't go wrong with this. Hahahaha. Mmmmm. Look at that thing of beauty. Yeah. Seriously. Look at that. So I would say we're leaving this place beyond satisfied. We couldn't even finish the chocolate cake. I know. Defeated by the chocolate cake. hahahaha. Yeah. So let's talk about price point for this meal. It was actually pretty good, right? Yeah. Good value. It came to 46 Reals which is about roughly 13 US dollars. So yeah, that was decent. We got three desserts. Three different desserts and we also got tea as well. Tea for two. So not bad at all. So definitely recommend coming here. I mean you're going to come here for the decor and the awesome environment but you're going to leave really satisfied by the taste of the desserts as well too. So our time in Rio de Janeiro is winding down. Like today is literally our last night in the city. But there is still one more food we wanted to try and that is Pao de qeijo. Voila! So of course we had to go to Casa do Pão de queijo. And that means the house of the cheese bread. And over there they've specialize in these little bread cheese balls and they are amazing. I used to eat these as a kid when I used to visit family and they are so so good. This is like my favorite Brazilian snack. I know, they are super tasty and you can find them almost everywhere. I mean this is embarrassing to admit but we've even had them at McDonald's here. McDonald's for breakfast. You can get coffee and Pão de queijo. So let's just dig right in. I'm going to grab one of these. So I have to admit these are best when they are like fresh out of the oven. And we've had these in our apartment for a few hours now. So they're not warm anymore but they are still a little bit gooey inside. I mean it is getting kind of dark here so I don't know if you can see that but it is like really cheesy and ooey and gooey and just oh so good. Mmmmm. Mmmmhhhmmm. So the key ingredient for these Pão de queijo is the casava flour. That is what makes it sticky inside. And then of course the cheese too. Oh. Mmmm. Aren't they so good? Oh man. I could just eat like them by the 10's. Yeah. And you know what? If you want to make these back at home you can actually pick up a bag at the supermarket of the powder and you mix it yourself. We have to do that. Definitely. So Sam is washing the Pão de queijo down with Guarana. And what is Guarana? It is like the most popular soft drink here in Brazil. Yeah. It kind of tastes a little bit like ginger ale. Not as much bite as ginger ale but it is a little bit sweeter. That is the best way I can describe it. Yeah. And apparently it comes from the maple family so I think that is the reason we enjoy it so much being Canadian. There you go. Alright and we've got a massive one over here. Yes. So aside from specializing in cheese bread you can also get sweet ones. And this one is filled with doce de leite. I know I'm butchering it every time. My Portuguese is awful. But this is like the dulce de leche filling. And if you can have a look at the bottom of the bread there is a little hole and that is where they've filled it with that ooey gooey caramel. So what do you think, should I bite into it? Yeah but don't take too much because you know what I want a lot of that too. That is my biggest concern here is that I'm not going to be left with much. Mmmmmm. Look at that. Can you see the filling. Oh yeah. There it is. Squeeze it some more. Squeeze it around a bit. Oh, wow. It is just seeping out from the side. So how is it? It is really good. Obviously it doesn't taste like cheese but it is still made with the casava flour so it has still kind of got that like chewy starchy consistency. So this is your dessert after you have the cheese ones right? Look at that. Look at that. Oh, don't you dare have anymore without me. Half and half. Half and half. Urgh. This is so good. Here you go before it is gone. And this is kind of a random item totally unrelated to bread but Sam saw it at the store. I saw it while we were checking out paying for the bill. And you know what I've never had a bananada. I'm guessing it is some kind of a banana candy. Oh wow. That is really thick. Look at that. It is coated in something. Wait. I've had this before. Have you. Yeah. Mmmmm. Oh, super sweet. Yeah. It is like condensed banana. Yeah, it is like it reminds me kind of like a burnt banana with sugar. Yeah. And like turned into a candy. Oh man. It is delicious. It kind of reminds me of the plantain we were having up north in the jungle. Except this is even more like candy than that. Wow. Mmmmm. Tasty. Mmmmm. Good. So bye bye cheese bread. It is all gone. All gone. So these exact ones here cost 12 Reals and I think the dessert one with doce de leite and bananada brought it up to 20 Reals. So you're talking about that is probably like six or seven US dollars at most. So not bad. For some of the best bread you'll ever try. Yes and we're both quite full after that so you can turn it into a snack slash meal. And you know what you've got some little crumbs on your mouth. Hahaha. So today's lunch video is going to be all about black beans. We are at a place that specializes in Feijoada. And that is kind of like a black bean stew. So everything we're going to be trying here from the appetizers to the mains is going to have black beans in some component. And this is something that you really find a lot in Brazilian cuisine so looking forward to sampling that. So for the appetizer here we have a Feijoada soup. So basically a black bean soup that you drink out of a cup. Never tried this before. It is kind of an exciting moment. Beans! Beans are exciting. Oh, wow. Yeah, is it a warm soup or a cold soup? How is it served? It is warm. It is not like pipping hot but it is warm. It is really thick. And it is very salty and flavorful. I quite like it to be honest. Is it just beans or does it have any chunks of meat? Um, no I think it is just beans. Just beans. We're drinking beans guys. So the food is here and we have a nice selection. Just have a look. Lots of different pots and things happening. So I'm just going to serve myself. Wow, that is a lot of food. Yeah, so we're going to start with a base of white rice that I just spilled all over the table. But white rice is one of those things that is never missing at the table when you're in a Brazilian home. And on top of that I'm going to put my Feijão which is the black beans. Black beans on its own. Oh, that looks good. And in the next one here you have the Feijoada which is the black beans and the meat. So this is like a bean and meat stew. It has different cuts and it is a mix of pork and beef. So I'll grab some sausage. Let's start with that. That looks good. Oh, there is more over here. So I'm going to grab some manioc. I think that is the English name for it. Some greens. And then over here we have - what is this one? Oh, okay so the powder is farofa which is kind of like a manioc flower. So you want to be careful with this because it is really easy to choke on it. You know what I think that is the one I tried on its own and I didn't enjoy it that much. But I think it is going to be pretty good with beans. It is very dry. Um, yeah and this apparently is fried pork skin. I think that is what I understood, so. It looks like a puffed cracker. It does. I've never tried fried pork skin. I'm not sure I'm going to like it but let's get started shall we. So you're getting a little bit of everything there. A little bit of everything. I almost feel like I should be eating this with a spoon. I feel like it is going to be messy. Mmmmm. That is quite good. I like that. Like the ingredients themselves are very simple. I mean rice and beans are super easy to make and super cheap. So yeah, and I kind of like it with the ferofa on top because it gives it kind of like a nutty flavor and it adds a bit of texture to it. So yeah, pleasantly surprised. It has been a while since I ate this so I'm enjoying it. Familiar flavor. So it is now Sam's turn. Time to dig in. Yeah, time to try it for the first time. So I've got the meat here, I've got the beans and I'm going to make sure I get a bit of the rice too. Time to try that Feijoada. That was a big piece of meat. Yeah. It's good. It's good. It is very salty and it does have a lot of flavors considering that it is just a bean dish. Yeah. I mean it is really high quality beans. A lot better than most of the types of beans I would eat back home in Canada for example. More flavorful. But yeah, it is simple food and it is tasty. I can see why it is popular here. We should also mention that we kind of tried to play it safe with the meat in our Feijoada because on the menu we saw they had like pig ears and pig feet and intestines and just different cuts. We could have gone all out but we played it safe today. Yeah, we were like um. We have a flight tomorrow. Maybe just beef and sausage will do. So that looks like a nice cut of beef there. Yeah. Let's try that. Nice and pink. That is really good. That kind of tastes like a roast beef. Yeah. I like that a lot. Okay, so now it is time for the fried pork skin. Going in for the fried pork skin. And it looks really crunchy. Oh, wow. Look at that. I mean I got it all over my fingers. Mmmmm. So if no one had told you this was pork skin what would you think it is? I've had something similar to this that was a prawn cracker. Okay. You know what it is quite tasty. It's very salty it is almost like a eating a potato chip. Almost. Yeah, it is good. Let's get a closer look at it. Let's see the texture. It is kind of hard to see. There we go. Oh. Not bad. What do you got over there? Okay, so now I'm trying something that is called manioc. And it kind of looks like a golden potato but the texture is more like a root. Like it is more quite fibrous. Is it kind of like yucca? Similar to yucca. Yeah. It is like really starchy. Is that good? It is nice. Yeah. It goes nice with the beans. With the bean sauce. The feijao. Okay so this right here is Brazil's national dish. So what can you tell us Sam? Yes but it did originate from Portugal. And what is really cool is you can find variations of this dish in former Portuguese colonies such as Macau and Goa, India. Yes. Mozambique. So travel around and try out the variations. Yeah, it feijoada around the world. Dessert has arrived. Dessert is here. Well, Sam is going to love this. So this one is Doce de leite and I'm probably butchering the name but that is Portuguese for dulce de leche. There it is. Oh wow. Mmmmmm. It is so nice to just eat it on its own. Like it is great on ice cream and bananas and cakes but even on its own. Like just on the spoon works perfectly. And what are the other two? So this one, the dark one is made out of banana. So let's try that. I've never had this one before. Mmmmmm. Yeah, it is kind of like caramelized bananas. It almost tastes a bit like a jam. I think I'm going to like that one a lot. And this one, last but not least, this one I asked but he said the name in Portuguese really quickly and I couldn't understand it. Hahahaha. It's a mystery. Number three. If I had to guess, maybe pumpkin. I was going to say sweet potato. Okay. It could be one of the two. One of the two. Why don't you try and tell me. So time to try the mystery dessert. The mystery. What could it be? Pumpkin or sweet potato? That is the question. The million dollar question. You know what, I think I don't know if it is pumpkin or sweet potato but it definitely has cinnamon. It definitely has cinnamon. That is what I've been able to ascertain. Hahahaha. Detective skills. Foodie detective. Okay, so the meal has come to its conclusion. We have finished everything in front of us just about. That was a lot of food. It was. The dessert was like the knockout blow. Yeah. It was the uppercut. Ready for siesta? Yeah, basically. So what did you think of your first feijoada? Yeah, I actually really liked it. It is simple food. Simple ingredients but it is quite tasty. And it is filling too. I did like it. I would eat it again. I think it is also worth mentioning this is a dish that you can find everywhere from like budget eateries to like top notch restaurants. So if you want to try it you don't necessarily have to pay a lot for it. You can find this anywhere in Brazil. I mean, it is the national dish right? Yes, that is right. So try it anywhere and for whatever budget you have. Yeah.",False,"20180101 - Brazilian Food Tour ≡ƒçº≡ƒç╖ΓÇ»∩╜£ 12 MustΓÇæTry Dishes in Rio and Sa╠âoΓÇ»Paulo ΓÇô Churrasco, Feijoada, Brigadeiro.en.srt"

It is seven in the morning. A little early to be out in my opinion but today we're going to Macau (澳門 - 澳门). Special day. So we've got our tickets for Macau (澳門 - 澳门). Woo! 160 Hong Kong dollars each. It is just over $20 US bucks and they give you your seats as you basically arrive. Just after you go through immigration. Yeah so we just got these little stickers. We're 17M and 17K and guys don't forget to bring your passport because technically you're going to a different special administrative region. You're going from Hong Kong (香港) to Macau (澳門 - 澳门). So we have just sat down in the boat (TurboJET - 噴射飛航). I already feel queasy. This is like rocking from side to side. Are you regretting your decision to have a Mcdonald's breakfast this morning? That was his idea. Not it wasn't. We needed something quick. We normally don't eat there. Oh man. Made it. And you know what? The ride was a lot smoother than I was expecting. I think it was because we were on the second floor of the boat this time. Yeah. That and the fact you were sleeping most of the way. I passed out. It was way too early to be traveling. In all fairness almost everyone was sleeping on that ride so. Yeah. So yeah now we're basically we're going to go catch our transportation. We're looking to find one of the free shuttle buses to the hotels we're looking for. Yes. Possibly the Venetian bus and then we get started. Haha. I feel so cheeky. We're being so cheap instead of paying for a bus or for the taxi. No, that is what everyone does. Free shuttle. That is what everyone does here. That is true. We found free transportation. Shhhh. So I'm not sure if we already mentioned this but today is just a day trip from Hong Kong (香港). So we're not actually staying here in Macau (澳門 - 澳门). We did that once before and it is super expensive here. Like everything is overpriced. So we thought we would just visit for the day and yeah we're going to be making a little guide and showing you a few of the different things that you can do here and eat here. We're going to be sampling lots of good food. Alright, so we figured since we took the free shuttle to the Venitian we should probably visit the Venetian (澳門威尼斯人度假村酒店). What do you think? So yeah, we've just been checking it out here. And it is definitely obviously not like Venice but I guess it is a casino version of Venice. It is a bit like Vegas. It is a bit like Vegas. And yeah Macao has been called the Vegas of China. So I mean. Yeah. Yeah we're going to go check out a few other casinos and then I think we're going to spend the rest of the day exploring more of the historic ruins and eating. More of the cultural side. More of the cultural stuff and then eating a lot of street food as well too. I have to say walking through casinos is exhausting. These buildings are massive. We're currently trying to reach the Parisian (澳門巴黎人) from the Venetian. I feel like we've been walking for 15 or 20 minutes. Still not in sight. So we had enough of hotels and casinos for a while and we've walked over to Taipa (氹仔) and over here we're going to be visiting the Taipa Houses Museum (龍環葡韻住宅式博物館 - Casas-Museu da Taipa). There is also like a nice little park with wetlands behind us. So yeah, it is a lot quieter and more peaceful over here. I would say I prefer it. So what did you think of the museum? Yeah, it was pretty cool. It was free to visit and there is about four different houses you can go in to. Each house had its own different kind of theme or gallery. One was a living museum, there was another where there was artwork and there was another where there was old photographs. So yeah if you pop by here you can check out the different houses. Just pop in and it doesn't take long to visit them at all. We have now been walking around for a few hours and I'm starting to feel the hanger vibes. Yeah, so it is a good time to go eat. It is just before noon and it is time to scarf down on some Macanese street food. Let's get food. So we kind of have a list of things we want to try here in Macau (澳門 - 澳门). Yes. And this was not on here. Wasn't on the list but we still found it interesting. So what is this one? So this is an egg pudding but I got the chocolate egg pudding. Yeah, they also had green tea right? Yeah. Um, so yeah it is like an egg. They sliced off the top. I don't even know how you make this to be honest. Do you shape the egg until it is creamy? I have no idea. We have no idea what this is and that is what makes it so exciting. Mmmm. Well it does not taste like boiled eggs so that is excellent. It is really creamy. Look at that. Is it sweet? Like how yeah. Yeah, it is literally like pudding. Okay. Maybe it is just like pudding that has been put inside of the eggshell. Maybe that is just the preparation of it. Look. Oh wow. This is a mystery to me. No idea how it is made but it is so delicious. Wow. And Sam doesn't like eggs so he was like no I won't have one. So are you going to eat it all then? You're missing out. Seriously this is like chocolate pudding. It is so creamy, so smooth. Unbelievable. So it took us a while to find a place that was serving pork chops this early. But we finally found one. Yeah, some of them weren't going to start serving them until 2pm. Until 2 pm. And it is around noon right now so oh bummer but we finally found somewhere and this pork chop bun (豬扒包) is one of the most popular street foods you can find in Macau (澳門 - 澳门). Yeah. It is basically. Oh wow. Thank you. Here comes our tea too. It is basically considered a Macanese specialty. Uh huh. And it is almost considered like a Macanese hamburger. Macau's take on a hamburger. So you've got your pork chop (豬扒包) in the middle. Yeah. And then you have a crispy bun. Well it is crispy on the outside and it is supposed to be soft on the inside. So I am dripping sauce all over the place. Time for me to just take a bite. Next up we're having Pastel de Nata (蛋撻 - 蛋挞) and this is where you start to see the Portuguese influence in Macanese cuisine. This is something that you find everywhere in Portugal. We had these when we were in Lisbon. There is a really famous shop um in Belem. And yeah these are really tasty. I've had these often. I know. So let's dig in. So excited to be having them again. Mmmm. And the Macanese take on it is really good. Mmmm. Really good. Look at that. It is like so custard-y inside. Wow. And we got these from what is considered to be a famous place for them. It is called Lord Stow's. Yeah. Yeah. It is not from the original shop but it is from one of the branches and ah yeah we're just really lucky to bump in to it. It is so flakey. Haha. The exterior. Look at that. Can you see the layers these. It is like Millefeuille. So I have to say I really enjoyed visiting this area. Taipa (氹仔). I hadn't been here before when I was last in Macao (澳門 - 澳门) and it is pretty cool. It just feels more historic. It is colorful. Great street food. So next up we're going to head to Senado Square (Largo do Senado - 議事亭前地) and to get there we're going to make use of some of the free transportation provided by the Casinos. Update. So the free shuttle that they used to have from the Galaxy Hotel to the area around Senado Square (Largo do Senado - 議事亭前地) a few years ago no longer runs. What? So we're going to Star World. Yep. And from there I think we're going to be walking about 20 minutes the guy said. It is getting us halfway there and then we have to walk. We're getting a little spoiled I'd say. We were on our way to Senado Square but then we spotted these really pretty garden so we're taking a bit of a detour. Yeah, it is has been nice so far and we've just been walking around and I think we're probably only like five or ten minutes away from where we want to be so getting closer. Where are we at the moment? So we're at Senado Square (Largo do Senado - 議事亭前地). This is where we've been trying to walk to now for a while. Yeah. We've just been taking some time-lapses so setting the camera up on the tripod and I think we're going to try and go find a bite. We're getting a little peckish again. Again. And you know what? It is looking super Christmas-y around here. It is. Check it out. It is only like 19 days away from Christmas. So yeah. But by the time you watch this Christmas will be long gone. Happy 2017! Haha. This is just a little bit too crowded for me. We're at a standstill. We're not moving. Not going anywhere. Ow. We're losing steam. We're still determined to see as much as we can in one day. Man. Yeah, we made it to Saint Paul's Ruins. We still haven't found food though so we're getting a little hangry. We have St. Paul's Ruins (大三巴牌坊) off in the background and Sam ready to sample more food. Yeah, so something you're going to find in Macau (澳門 - 澳门) well just about everywhere. Especially around the Saint Paul's Ruins (大三巴牌坊) is you get this beef jerky that is for sale. Yeah. And you buy these big slabs and they cut it up for you like there is just a huge amount here. So I'm going to try it. I did sample this one. It is sweet. Is it beef or pork? That is the question. It is pork. Pork. Pork jerky (豬肉乾). Mmmm. That is really nice. It has got like a sweet glaze on it. It kind of reminds me of um if you've ever had a cooked ham that has been cooked in like molasses or maple syrup or something like that. Very Canadian. Maple Syrup. Uh huh. It kind of has that glaze type of sweetness on the outside and it is nice meat. It is not unlike other jerkys that I've had before it is not as chewy. Um, it basically you just bite in to it and the meat basically disintegrates in your mouth so it is nice. We've got a lot. Look at that. Man. We're going to be here for a while. So we're still trying to eat our way around the city here and it is starting to rain. Today was supposed to be zero percent chance of precipitation and look at what is happening. With all of these clouds I'm actually surprised it didn't rain earlier. Anyways we found our next snack and we're having almond cakes (杏仁餅). So check those out. It looks really powdery and it actually has chunks of almond in it. Wow. And we saw these being freshly made. So it is pretty amazing. That is how we decided on the store. We're like oh they're making them right outside so. How are those? Good. It is quite dry. It is almost like a chalky like powdery texture so if you're planning on having a few you probably want tea or like some kind of beverage nearby. A bubble tea (波霸奶茶). Have a bubble tea nearby. We didn't get a bubble tea (波霸奶茶) actually. Hahaha. That is next. But yeah it is really nice. Really tasty. Kind of a nice Christmas treat. Almond for some reason it seems like a Christmas-y ingredient. Alright so Sam is now rocking a purple drink in his hand. Yeah. What could that possibly be? So we've had bubble tea (波霸奶茶) in both Taiwan and in Hong Kong (香港). Yeah, but we haven't had it in Macao (澳門 - 澳门) and we haven't had Taro before. So this is a purple color. And you can see it still has the tapioca jellies at the bottom. Yeah but time to try it. Alright, so taro milk. Mmmm. What does taro milk taste like? It is really sweet. It has a bit of a creamy taste and you can definitely can taste the taro. It is strong. Does it taste like potato. Like potato milk. A little bit. It still tastes a bit like tea though too. It is really good. So next we're heading into Museu de Macau (澳門博物館). We have not decided whether or not we actually want to go in to the museum. Still debating that. We've been walking around a lot and visiting the museum involves more walking. I'd be pretty happy to just enjoy the view maybe eat some more. So Sam what is the one determining factor on whether you want to visit a museum or not? What do you always ask? Can we take photos? I thought you were going to say is it free? Oh is free too. Yeah those things. If it doesn't meet those criteria then sometimes I just do not go in. So that was made easy. The exhibit was actually closed so we can only enjoy the terrace but the terrace has some pretty cool views so we're here. So Sam last attraction of the day. Where are we? So we are at Monte Fort. Monte Fort (Fortaleza do Monte - 大炮台). And yeah it is starting to rain quite a bit. It is starting to rain and it has been a long day so we're going to head back and leave you with these magnificent views. We should probably say thank you to the Wynn Hotel for that private transfer to the ferry terminal. We were the only people on the shuttle bus. Literally. And we didn't even stay at their hotel. Well welcome to a nondescript hotel room somewhere in Asia. Today we're going to be talking Macau travel tips because we recently traveled there on a day trip from Hong Kong and actually we've also been there. We went there maybe like 3 years ago. Yeah. And we stayed overnight. So we thought why not share some of the tips, some of the things we've learned for anywhere out there planning a trip there. And because we've done both of those types of trips we think we can offer something for just about everyone. So yeah, you can do it by day from Hong Kong and you can also stay overnight too. So as usual we've got our notes in front of us on the computer so you're going to see us staring down but that is just so we give you accurate information and we're not making stuff up. Yeah. Yeah. So how a lot of people describe Macau (澳門 - 澳门) is they call it the Vegas of China. But you know what that is not really fair because Macao actually generates seven times the amount of revenue as the strip on Vegas. Cha chingy chang. So if anything Vegas should be called you know the it should be the Vegas should be the Macau of the United States. America! Yeah. All of America. So that is how much gambling is a part of Macau (澳門 - 澳门). But Macao (澳門 - 澳门) is also way more than just gambling. It also has a lot of colonial history and you can really see that when you're walking around in the Old Town. It is just very Portuguese. Like buildings, the floor tiles, even the cuisine. So even if you're not in to gambling it is really worth visiting. Right. And there is also a lot of really fascinating street foods as well. That is called Macanese cuisine. It is a combination of Portuguese and Southern Chinese with a lot of Southeast Asian ingredients. Oh la lah. Quite fascinating stuff. So the local currency is the Macau Pataca. I had no idea so I was calling it Macau dollars or Macanese dollar the whole time I was there which is pretty embarrassing. That is. Anyway the exchange is $1 USD = 8 MOP Patacas. Yeah, and it is basically almost identical to the Hong Kong Dollar. And that leads into our next point where if you're coming from Hong Kong you can use Hong Kong Dollars in Macau (澳門 - 澳门). Yes. It is widely accepted. Yep. But here is the catch. If you do take out the Macau Patacas. If you have quite a bit of them you're going to want to especially exchange your coins before you go back to Hong Kong because those coins are not accepted in Hong Kong. Yeah. So yeah, it is kind of a bit of a double standard. I'm not sure why that is but yeah if you do have Hong Kong extra Hong Kong dollars do bring them in and spend them in Macau. It is possible to do that. So our next point is transportation. How do you get to Macau (澳門 - 澳门) and there are actually lots of different ways. Right. I would say probably the most popular if you're coming from Hong Kong would be the ferry. Right. And you can take the ferry from Hong Kong Island, Kowloon or from Hong Kong International Airport. Yeah, so you have those different options and so that is arriving from the let's say arriving from Hong Kong but you can also arrive from Mainland China. There are buses from like Guangzhou and other places. Shenzhen. Different types of places. They also have ferries too. Uh huh. And then of course there is the airport. And something to keep in mind even if you're going to visit Hong Kong not just Macau is that uh the Macau airport has some really good budget flights. Yes. So you may actually be able to fly into Macau cheaper than Hong Kong. So if you're thinking of flying into Hong Kong especially somewhere from Southeast Asia consider also Macau (澳門 - 澳门). Because you may get a much better deal. I remember the one time we flew in from Chiang Mai we got a really good price from Air Asia. So yeah, do consider that. And you know what? Speaking of flights we should also mention you can come to Macau by helicopter. Haha. Fancy. Yeah, if you want to arrive like a boss. If you want to arrive in style. I think it is like about $500 dollars one way. Yeah, it is about $500 US dollars but it is only 16 minutes from Hong Kong. So if you're in a rush and you want to start gambling you know take the helicopter and you'll be there in no time. So speaking of the ferry you're going to save a little bit of money if you go on a weekday as opposed to the weekend. It is just slightly cheaper. Um, you're looking at around just over $20 US dollars for an economy class. Yeah. And that is perfectly adequate. I mean uh it is only an hour ride so and there is departures leaving every like. Very frequently. Yeah. Like 15 to 30 minutes. Right. And you can go anytime of day. You can leave really early in the morning and you can come back late at night. Or vice versa. So it is really easy. We've always just shown up and bought our ticket. Um, like right from the stands. Right when we wanted to go and that is probably fine on weekdays but if there is like a really big event going on in Macau or it is on a weekend during a busy time of year I'd recommend booking in advance and you can do that on the TurboJET's website. I've also once booked it online. It was really easy. They accept credit cards and stuff like that. Of course. Super easy. So next let's talk about accommodations in Macau and we've got to tell you just like Hong Kong it is not cheap. I would go as far as saying that it can be more expensive than staying in Hong Kong. Yeah, it is. Hong Kong does have budget options. You can stay in dorms. In Macau that is basically nonexistent. Yeah. Uh, I remember even the first time I visited Macau which is before I met you they didn't really have many dorm options or hostel options and that is true even to today. And I guess when most people are going over there to gamble um yeah. They've got the cash. They've got money. And there isn't even a lot of very good mid-range options to be honest. Yeah. So there are some sort of more like dingy hotels which are not located by the casinos not located by the main attractions. And you can probably find something for under $100 US dollars but don't expect a lot at that price which is kind of why we recommend doing it by day. If you're visiting Macau more for the culture and the food then you can definitely make a day trip from Hong Kong. But if you do want to gamble and do some of the more entertainment. The shows at night and stuff then you probably will just have to cough up the money stay in a casino or like famous hotel and pay a bit more. And we have notes on that here. So a 2 to 3 star is going to be between $88 to 160 USD and if you're looking for 4 to 5 stars a $150 all the way up to $600 US bucks. So yeah, bring your money. Hahaha. So there are AirBNB options. We noticed some places where you can get a shared room for $40 to $60 dollars a night. So that is actually not bad. Well not a shared room. Like your own private room in someone's house. Right. But you won't have the whole apartment to yourself. Yeah, sorry. That is what I meant. And I noticed that those places weren't like right in the core the city. So again more on the outskirts. And if you're wanting to get your own place you're looking at $80 to $200 dollars plus. Yeah. So yeah, again not very cheap. Um but it is available. So next up let's talking about transportation around Macau (澳門 - 澳门). And one thing we really enjoy is that all of the casinos and hotels offer free shuttles from the terminal because obviously they want to lure guests. Like come gamble at our place. Yep. So they offer free transportation which is great for visitor's on a budget I would say. It really is. So you can literally arrive at one of the ferry terminals and then hop on one of these free shuttle buses and they will take you to all of the major casinos and also to some major attractions as well. Yeah. So it is actually a really good way to get around the city and it is absolutely free. So you can that is our favorite way to get around Macao. Hands down. So aside from free transportation also just walk around Macau on foot. I mean a lot of places once you arrive in a certain area like if you're in Taipa or you're near Senado Square or Saint Paul's Ruins for example. A lot of the places that you can just reach by foot and it is just a really pleasant way to just walk around in Macau. So it is very pedestrian friendly and we definitely recommend it. That being said we would not recommend walking from the strip where all of the casinos are all the way to Senado Square because you're not going to make it. Take a bus to get there. And then you can walk around once you're there. That would be really pushing it. Yes. Haha. Uh, another option is you can take also public buses which are fairly cheap and also taxis. So a taxi shouldn't cost more than about $5 US dollars for short rides and yeah if you're in a hurry that would probably be your best bet because you do sometimes have to wait around for the shuttle buses. They leave at designated times for example. And if something is too far to walk then consider taking the taxi or one of the public buses. So for all of you budget travelers out there next up we're going to talk about free attractions you can visit around Macau. And number 1 I would say the area around Senado Square which is kind of like the main plaza the main square. You have lots of Portuguese architecture and tiles. Yeah. You can get some street food while you're there. Yeah, it is nearby a lot of other major attractions and it is just a very central area and it is a great place to people watch as well. Yeah, and once you're at Senado Square you can walk all the way to the ruins of Saint Paul which is basically the facade of a church. Like the building is no longer there so all you see is the facade and the stepz leading up to it. But I would say that is a pretty cool walk from those two points. It is a major landmark and you're going to see tonnes of people taking photos there. It is quite photogenic and it is also you pass from Senado Square all the way to the ruins that you're going to see probably where you can most of your street food too. Yes, free samples of food guys. Food! That was another one of our free things. Yeah, a lot of these stores they lure people in by offering free samples. You can get free samples of almond cookies, free samples of like the pork jerky with glazed honey. So yeah there is a lot of different free samples so hit those up before you actually purchase something. So obviously another free attraction are all of the hotels and casinos and I mean some of them are themed. You have the Venetian which looks just like Venice and you have the Parisian which looks just like Paris. So if you enjoy that kind of thing you can go hotel and casino hopping. Yeah, and some of them are really cool inside. And the nice thing is that all of the shopping area and all of the entertainment area is free to anyone in the public. It is only the casino part where you have to be gambling in order to go in to. You can't just wander around in there. So aside from Senado Square another really cool place where you can see a lot of Portuguese architecture and visit some museums is Taipa. And it is also a great place to get street food. That is where we tried are Macanese egg tarts and a few other delicious things. Pork chop buns. Yes. So that is a great place to wander around. So we've already talked about free attractions in Macau. Now we're going to move on to things that you're probably going to want to pay for. So first up we have Macau Tower. Yeah, and I mean you're going to get a great view of Macau from there. All the casinos all of the different islands. So yeah, definitely go up it. This is actually a confession time. This is something we haven't done before but yeah if you're in to towers and getting really good views then definitely check it out. And you know what, I'm pretty sure you can go bungee jumping. Yes, you can. It is something we've never really researched. No. Because we have no interest. We're both terrified of heights so that is not something we'd do but if you have a little more courage than us consider it. So the price to go up Macau tower is 130 Pataca MOP and it is obviously a little bit cheaper if you're a child or a senior citizen. So this next attraction that you're going to want to pay for is a mouthful. So I'm going to read it to you. It is called City of Dreams House of Dancing Water Spectacular. RIght. And basically it is a nightly show. Kind of like a performance so if you like entertainment that is something you can do. Yeah, this is located on the strip where all the casinos are. RIght, and again that is something we haven't done but it is very very highly rated. But this one is quite pricey. So in terms of prices it is going to cost you 580 Hong Kong Dollars which is about $75 US dollars per ticket. And of course we couldn't talk about Macau without mentioning gambling. So so many people go there to gamble and if you're so inclined you can spend as little or as much as you want. You can drop huge wads of cash in Macau (澳門 - 澳门) and if you want to gamble there is no shortage of places that will take your money. And there is probably no limit to how much you can bet. Yeah, exactly. So next up we're going to talk about different foods you can try in Macau. And we actually made an entire video dedicated to Macanese street food so you can check that out if you're interested. If you're a bit of a foodie. There are just tonnes of options. Like we ate like seven or eight different things. So there is just tonnes of things to try. And we ate really well. So I would say one of my favorites was the egg tarts. The Portuguese egg tarts. Those were so tasty. Oh my gosh. So crispy. Those. Flaky. Those were so good. Those liked rivaled the egg tarts you find in Portugal. The original ones. What are they Pasteis de Nata? Yeah. Yeah. They were so good. Those are fantastic and they're also really cheap. So another really popular one to have that we highly recommend is the pork chop bun. It is basically like just like a pork chop in a bun. And the outside of the bun is crispy and then it is really doughy inside. Yeah, it is toasted. Yeah, it is toasted. It is just really good. Trust me. Try that one. Just make sure you don't like bite into the bone like Sam did. Oh my gosh. Because the pork chop obviously has the chop in there. I didn't see the bone and I bit in to it really hard and I thought of my gosh did I just chip a tooth. I was wondering am I actually going to be able to enjoy Macau or not or do I have to go to a make an emergency dentist appointment. Okay, so next up, and this is for the more adventurous people, try the durian ice cream. Aw! Oh my gosh. It smells bad. I love durian you hate it. So if you already know you hate durian then obviously don't try it. Stay away. But if you've never tried try the durian ice cream it is really good. And the next one I want to talk about is basically the sweet pork jerky that you can find. These are just the thin strips that are cut up with scissors and put into a bag. They are really good. It is really soft. It is so different from North American jerky or also Biltong which is something I've tried from South Africa. It is really soft jerky. It is really sweet. It makes a great snack. And another thing I really enjoyed trying was the almond cookies. Oh yeah. And those for some reason just make me think of Christmas. They're like little small bite sized cookies and they're very dry. Yeah, so if you're going to try a whole bunch you probably want to enjoy them with tea or some kind of beverage. Yeah, maybe bubble tea. We enjoyed ours with bubble tea. Mmmm. Oh yeah. And if you guy by some shops you can actually see them making almond cookies which is fascinating. So I would recommend buying them from one of the shops that is making them right in front of you. You know it is fresh. You know it is good. And another thing you can try in Macau is Portuguese wine. We didn't get to do this. Oh, I highly regret not doing that. Yeah. We just didn't have time. I love wine so I would have loved to try the Portuguese wine. Apparently, it is really affordable and really good quality too. Next time. Now moving on to things we loved about Macau. Yeah, so these are all of things we really liked about Macau and what made it an attractive place to visit. So number 1 would be the free hotels and casinos you can just wander around and I mean you've got these grand buildings. Yeah. So it is kind of like woah! If you're there just for shopping and entertainment you could literally make that the focus of your entire trip. There is just so many different casinos and hotels to visit. And every time we go back there is a new one. There is like a new building. They build fast in Macao. Oh. I have to say. They sure do. Yeah, anyways another thing we enjoyed was the street food. Which we've mentioned a few times already. That was really good. Oh my gosh the Macanese street food is amazing. And one of the advantages of snacking on street food all day long as opposed to going to sit down restaurants is that it really helps you manage your time. You can see and do a lot more when you're just like picking up these little bites. Having something quick to eat and then moving on to the next thing. And it is a lot more affordable than going out for a fancy meal. Yes. In Macau (澳門 - 澳门) because I have a feeling that would not be affordable. No, it could get pricey really quick. And yeah, all of the Macanese street food is really cheap. Like everything was under $5 US dollars. Some things were under $1. So really cheap. Really delicious. Highly recommend it. So another thing we really like is all of the Portuguese architecture and ruins that you can find throughout the city. It is just fascinating to see that type of architecture in you know a part of the world where you normally wouldn't associate that with. Yeah. It just gives a some people come obviously to Macau to gamble and to do other things like that but you can also be a culture vulture and enjoy the Portuguese architecture. Culture vulture. And other things. So another point to add is that this is such an easy day trip. Like it is just so convenient to hop on a ferry and you're there. Right. So the ease of travel is another really alluring thing about Macau (澳門 - 澳门). It is very attractive and if you want to do the way we did it we woke up really early in Hong Kong we went to the ferry terminal bought our ticket, quickly went through immigration. Do remember to bring your passport. Yes. You are going from one special administrative region to another. From Hong Kong to Macau so don't forget to do that. But yeah, you can go buy your ticket on the spot. We were on the baot within like what 30 minutes. And then it an hour to Macau (澳門 - 澳门). Immigration was a breeze there and so like by I don't know by 8 or 9 we were like already rolling. We were sightseeing. We were sightseeing, exploring Macau. So yeah and then you can come back again late at night. And that makes for a great really busy day. I find that when you have some time scarcity like that you just maximize your time. Yeah, you really run around. We did. And we saw a lot and yeah check out our video to see what we did in just one day. And one final point about things we loved about Macau would have to be the free transportation provided by the hotels and casinos. Thank you! Thank you hotels and casinos. Even though we didn't really spend money. I know we took like three different shuttles. Yeah, oh what was it the Wynn Hotel. We went from the Wynn Hotel back to the ferry. We were the only people on that shuttle. And they drove us. It was a private ride. It was awesome. So yeah, do take advantage of the free transportation. These casinos and hotels they have tonnes of money so you don't have to feel guilty about it. Alright, moving on to the things we hated about Macau. Basically the things we disliked about Macau (澳門 - 澳门). And the first thing that comes up is the accommodations. The lack of budget and mid-range accommodations. It really out prices a lot of travelers and visitors. But obviously the city is making a lot of money so I don't see that changing anytime soon. And I don't see there being a lot of budget accommodations both now and in the future. So another thing that we kind of hated about Macau is that let's say by mid afternoon a lot of the major attractions like Senado Square, Saint Paul's Ruins it is just packed with people. Super crowded. Oversaturated. Yeah, it is a little bit overwhelming. So the way that you can get around that is to visit these earlier in the morning. Yeah. Um, especially if you're staying in Macao (澳門 - 澳门). We didn't have that option because we got to these around the mid-afternoon but it was a little bit overwhelming. Yeah, there was a point where we weren't actually moving. We were just standing there in a crowd like kind of getting pushed and shoved. So that wasn't so pleasant. I guess that is one of the downsides. Right. So to like we said to get around that visit during off hours. And the last thing that I didn't really enjoy was the ferry ride coming back. It was totally fine on the way there but on the way back it was super choppy. And like the boat was bouncing up and down and that is when I understood why they have seat belts on the seats on the ferry. It is because like you're getting some serious air. And it is like uhh. To be honest that doesn't bother me as much. Like I don't get as seasick. And one tip we can offer is to try to get a seat on the second level. That is never as choppy as on the first level. Yeah. So yeah, try to get your seat on the second level especially if you mind the choppy waters and if you get seasick easily. Yeah, so I would say those are all of our travel tips for Macau. I hope you found them useful and we wish you a wonderful trip. If you're traveling there soon. Absolutely. Do visit Macau it is definitely worth at least one visit there at one point in your life.

Yes, this is a city of modern skyscrapers and futuristic architecture, but if you scratch beneath the surface and spend a little time here, you’ll discover pockets of tranquility in the form of incense-filled temples and bonsai gardens, a delicious foodie scene that features budget friendly Michelin-stared restaurants, mountainous islands that are an easy day trip away, antique markets full of treasure, and a dazzling skyline you won’t soon forget. Without further ado, let us show you 25 things to do in Hong Kong: Let’s kick things off at the Peak Tram, where the steep 7 minute ride to Victoria Peak (山頂纜車) gives you some of the best views of the city. So we just finished riding the tram to Victoria Peak (太平山 - 扯旗山) and now we're enjoying the free views. We could be paying more and going up to the sky terrace but we refused because the free views are good enough. Yeah, and if you're willing to walk out a little bit from the complex you'll find that you know the crowds slowly dissipate. And hey we're just by ourselves right now. At 552 meters, the Peak (太平山 - 扯旗山) is the highest mountain on Hong Kong Island (香港島) and its location offers vast views of towering skyscrapers, Victoria Harbour and Kowloon (九龍) off in the distance. For more postcard worthy views of Hong Kong (香港), we also visited Victoria Harbour (維多利亞港) at sunset and then watched as the skies turned from amber to fiery orange. Another event you should definitely make time for is the Symphony of Lights (幻彩詠香江), which is a daily music and light show that encompasses both sides of the harbour. Skyscrapers dazzle with blinking lights and lazer beams, while everyone oooh’s and aaah’s from the waterfront. You can watch the show from either Kowloon (九龍) or Hong Kong Island (香港島), but I personally prefer being on Kowloon since Hong Kong island has the iconic skyline. We are currently in the Nan Lian Garden (南蓮園池) which is right across from the Chi Lin Nunnery (志蓮淨苑). And again like most parks here in Hong Kong it is super peaceful. They have soft music playing. You can hear the birds chirping. There is beautiful flowers. There is like a little golden pagoda in the middle of a lake. So we're going to show you all of that now. After visiting the gardens, we crossed over to the Chi Lin Nunnery (志蓮淨苑), which is a Buddhist temple complex that dates back to the 1930s. What is perhaps most impressive is that the structures were built out of wood but without the use of a single nail! Alright guys we have three words for you! Tim Ho Wan (添好運)! Tell us all about it. What is this place? This is basically one of the best places to try dim sum in all of Hong Kong. Yes. It is a Michelin starred restaurant yet it is affordable. So we're going to go in, we're going to order a lot of food and we're just going to scarf down some dim sum (x點心 - 点心xx). Okay. Oh the joy. Ready. Yeah. Alright guys so we just finished placing our order. And this is what the menu looks like. You basically grab a pencil and you tick off the different dishes you're interested in. The first one has already arrived. Oh wow. So we got a little bit greedy because it is like three in the afternoon. We haven't had lunch yet so we ordered seven different dishes and we're going to be showing you those once they arrive. First one is here and this one is the sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf. This is one of our favorite ones. I love this one. So let's not waste any time. Let's just start unfolding this masterpiece. Wow. Lots of steam rising. Ooh! Look at that. It is a huge leaf. It is a huge one. And there you've got the sticky rice with chicken I believe and a nice mushroom. So we're going to be sharing this. Mmmm. Wow. So good. Well what do you think? I love it. He loves it. And there is more food. Oh my gosh. So I'm just going to use my hand because it is a little bit easier for me. But man these are nice and plump. Yeah. Everything here is plump and stuffed. They do not skimp out here. Mmm. Mmmm. What do you think? There you have it. There is the barbecued bun. This is so fluffy. Oh my gosh. I know. It is a lot fluffier than I remember. Wow. What about the taste? Do you like it? Mmmm. It is really nice because it is like savory inside but then really sweet on the exterior so you get both flavors. It is that contrast that makes it so good. Mmmm. So the next on the menu is one of our absolute favorites. I believe it is called Har Gao and that is basically the almost like shrimp dumplings. Yeah, they are. Shrimp in a little wrapper and they are just so good. Oh my gosh this is a slippery one. Haha. Don't burn yourself. I have a feeling it is going to be really hot. Those are like freshly steamed. Oh man. His eyes are bulging out. That was a big bite. Hahaha. So yeah it is just filled with like so much shrimp and you just bite into it and it is juicy and it is just so flavorful and tasty. It is so plump. It is. Seriously. That is the best way to describe them. Just such plump pieces of shrimp. I think it goes without saying that Tim Ho Wan (添好運) is one of our favourite places for dim sum (點心 - 点心), and it’s worth seeking out if you’re ever in Hong Kong (香港)! So next up we're going to watch the Noon Day Gun (午炮). And I have to admit the first time I heard about this attraction I had no idea what it was. Sam actually mentioned it to me last time we were in Hong Kong like three years ago. And I just thought Noon Day Gun (午炮) was a name. To me it sounded like Chinese. But apparently it is a gun that they fire during the day at noon so we're just waiting for that to happen right now. Getting here is a little tricky. I wish I could give you instructions. Um, basically you can probably see the Excelsior Hotel behind me. The Excelsior. Um, you need to go down some tiny side alley and then cross through a tunnel. Um but yeah it is a little bit tricky to find it. We went into like three buildings before we found the right place so you may have to ask around to find it. Um but yeah we're here. We're going to watch this gun be fired. Woah! Well Sam after all of these years you finally got to see the Noon Day Gun again. How was it? Yeah, it must have been like six or seven years ago that I got to experience this. Well my biggest tip for this is when you come here make sure you plug your ears just before the shot. Yes! It is some kind of loud. And it almost makes you like shake. That is how loud it is. It is really powerful. Yeah. It is scary. It is a powerful blast. And it is a very short ceremony. Like he just rings the bell, fires the gun and off he goes. And then you can come in and check this place out. For thirty minutes. You can go and take some pictures of the gun and just walk around. It is pretty cool. Another fun thing to do in Hong Kong is to ride the double decker trams (香港電車). This was one of the earliest forms of transportation in the city, and riding them through the modern financial district feels a bit nostalgic. If you’re really looking for something memorable, you can actually hire a party tramway and celebrate with music, drink, and stellar views as you cruise through the city. We are currently making our way down Upper Lascar Row and this is the place to buy souvenirs. There is also some construction happening so it is bit loud. But basically the street is lined with shops that sell really high end antiques and then on the street you have like these little tables where you have old trinkets and just things that would make really cool souvenirs but also have a history behind them. So it is worth checking out for sure. I haven't picked up anything but I do see things that interest me. It is just I don't have a home and I don't have room in my suitcase. If antiques aren’t really your thing and you’re looking for something a bit more modern, Causeway Bay (銅鑼灣) is full of malls, department stores, and fashion boutiques. So today we are going in search of free views of Hong Kong. Always like free stuff. So we're here at Central Plaza (中環廣場) and apparently on the forty sixth floor there is a skydeck. So we're going to be checking this out for the first time. We've never done this in Hong Kong before. Let's do it. So look at this. We get three hundred and sixty degree views of Hong Kong from this building and no one is here. And it is free. More people should know about this place. Seriously guys. Free views of Hong Kong all to yourself. So this is a bit of a quirky attraction to be listing, but not every city offers the opportunity to ride a series of escalators instead of walking up hills. The Central–Mid-Levels escalator (中環至半山自動扶梯) is the longest covered escalator system in the world, so it’s worth experiencing at least once. Just know that there is no escalator going down, so you’ll have to take the stairs. Man Mo Temple (文武廟) dates back to 1847 and it is dedicated to the God of Literature and the God of War. For a little trivia, this temple was once popular with students looking to succeed in the civil examinations of Imperial China. We are currently inside the Man Mo Temple (文武廟) and it is thick with incense in the air. I don't know if you can actually see it. But is almost burns your eyes a little bit yet it looks magical at the same time. So it is a weekend in Hong Kong. Tell us what are we up to? Yeah, it is time for some nightlife in Hong Kong. We're at Lan Kwai Fong and this is probably the most popular nightlife area in the city. We're not exactly going to paint the town red but I think we'll get a beer or maybe a glass of wine. So I'm the kind of person who would rather be at home in bed reading a book on a Sunday night but apparently that is considered lame. So somebody insisted we check out the nightlife. That is all kinds of nerdy. All kinds of nerdy. So here we are. The funny thing is it is like seven thirty PM right now and we're super early. Yeah. It is going to get hopping around nine or ten. By which time we'll be back. We'll be sleeping by then. Back in the hotel. But anyways cheers. What did you get? Ah, I got red wine. And I got gin and tonic. Salut. If you’re looking to get out of the city and a little closer to nature, you can ride the aerial tramway (昂坪360) to Lantau Island. Once you’re there you can visit the Po Lin Monastery (寶蓮禪寺), and also visit the Tian Tan Buddha (天壇大佛), better known as the Big Buddha. So one thing to keep in mind is that if you visit the Buddha in the morning it is backlit. So if you're a photographer and you want to be able to take some good shots from the front you may have better luck in the afternoon. Otherwise this is what you'll get. Time for a little update. Yeah, so we've had a busy day exploring Hong Kong. Now it is time to go back to our apartment and this is our favorite way of getting around the city. Is taking the Star Ferry (天星小輪). Star Ferry (天星小輪). In my opinion it is like iconic transportation in Hong Kong. You've got to do it. It is cheap it is fun. You can cross Kowloon to Hong Kong Island or vice versa. And it is just something we look forward to doing every time we visit Hong Kong. And the views. If museums are your thing, you can always pop into the Hong Kong Museum of History (香港歷史博物館) in Tsim Sha Tsui, which looks at Hong Kong’s history and cultural heritage. The permanent exhibition is free of charge. So right now we're visiting Hong Kong Park (香港公園) and this is one of the coolest parks in the city because you are surrounded by skyscrapers yet you can hear the sounds of nature. They have streams and waterfalls and you can hear the birds chirping and there is palm trees swaying so it feels very peaceful but you can still see that Hong Kong is a very modern city and it is not that far away. Inside the park they also have this huge walk through Aviary. Um and yeah they just have birds flying freely. One just nearly hit someone in the head. And it is pretty cool. They have over six hundred birds in here. Another cool park you can visit is Kowloon Park (九龍公園), which offers a serene escape on the other side of the harbour. For a bit of a splurge and some sugary treats, we would recommend indulging in afternoon tea. We went to Lion Rock inside the Royal Plaza Hotel. Alright so I'm so excited the tea is here. And we each get our own pot. And seriously there is probably like three cups in here. And they've already poured one. Yours is like the chocolate truffle? It is the chocolate mint truffle. I don't even know. Oh my gosh. The order. But it smells amazing. That seems like a bit of a fancy pants tea. Yeah, it smells like melted chocolate with mint? Does it? I can't say I smell the truffle but I'm not that familiar with truffle so. Mmmm. That is nice. The flavor itself isn't very strong but it is more the aroma that you get before you drink it. And like you don't need any sugar or milk with this. It is just so good. I love the way it smells. It smells like the holidays. We are both so giddy right now. The tower of heavenly delights has arrived. Low and behold. So let's see what can we choose. So we're going to start from the top and work our way down. So we have some scones, some chips with crab meat I think. This looks like a mini quiche and then we have mini burgers. Mini sliders. What is on the second level? Well, we'll get to that later. But first let's eat from the top alright. And I have a major sweet tooth so I'm starting with the scone. I'm just going for it. Why waste any time. So there we have it. There is the little scone. Going to cut it in half and I've got some jam here. And I'm really hoping this is clotted cream and not butter. But it might be butter. I think it may be butter. Would that be the saddest thing ever? With butter. It is a little sad but I will survive. Hahaha. It is not England so that is okay. And then some jam. Oh yeah baby. This is what I came for. The scones that is my favorite part of the whole afternoon tea experience. So if you don't want your scone Sam I will take it. Oh, I'll have my scone. I'll gladly relieve you. No worry about that. This is like one bite. Mmmm. Oh man. That is how it is done. So I think I have something that might be a mushroom tart. It has a very um flaky exterior and it looks like mushrooms on top. So there we go. I don't know if I should do it in one bite or two. All in one bite. Oh my gosh that is a huge one. One bite. You can handle it Sam. Oh, keeping things classy. Mmmmm. We'll give you a second to chew it. And search for your words. So food doesn't go flying everywhere. Right. That would be a civilized way of doing things. So if you've ever had like a thick mushroom creamy soup before it tastes like that. And then it just aww the pastry is so buttery and flaky. And you just bite into it and it just disintegrates in your mouth. Oh la lah. And you're rolling that mushroom around it is just aww that is nice. Rolling it around huh? Rolling it around on your palette. Mmm. And you get the idea. It was an hour of om nom noms! This evening we're taking part in Sam's favorite activity. Shopping! Oh yeah. Shopping. No, we're headed over to Temple Street Night Market and we're just going to check it out and see what is happening out there. The market (庙街 - 廟街) itself stretched for several blocks and offered all kinds of clothes, purses, souvenirs and random knick-knacks. We also spotted some street karaoke happening in the area. Lastly, let’s talk about transportation. The most effective way to get around Hong Kong is by MTR (港鐵). If you’re going to be here a few days and you don’t want to pay for individual tickets each time, you can get an Octopus card (八達通) and also save on the fare. As a final piece of advice, try to avoid travelling in Hong Kong (香港) during rush hour. You’ll either feel like a canned sardine on the subway, or be left behind on the platform like a beached whale because there’s no more room. And that’s a wrap for Hong Kong (香港). We hope that you enjoyed this travel guide and that it gave you a few ideas of things to do and places to visit on your own trip. We know we only covered a small fraction of everything Hong Kong (香港) has to offer, so if you have any other suggestions of things travellers should experience, feel free to share those in the comments below. Wishing you happy travels and until next time! Alright guys, so in today's video we are going to be sharing some travel tips for Hong Kong and also letting you know how expensive is Hong Kong? Yeah, how expensive is Hong Kong? I think we all know the answer to that. Yeah, it is quite expensive but there is also some really cool aspects about Hong Kong (香港) almost unlike any other city we've visited. There is a plethora of free things to do and budget eats. Budget eats and also transportation is really cheap. But we're going to break everything down and let you know the costs for Hong Kong. Okay so first up let's get started with transportation from the airport in to Kowloon (九龍) or Hong Kong Island (香港島). Right and like our last travel tips video we've got our notes on our computer so you'll see us looking down from time to time. We just don't want to miss anything. Alright, so the first point we have is arriving by Airport Express. And that is what we did getting in to Hong Kong. It is like this really fast train that takes you right in to the city. You can get off at Kowloon (九龍) or you can go all the way to Hong Kong Island at Central station. And it super efficient, really fast, very comfortable. Um, in terms of the price so you're looking at a $100 Hong Kong dollars all the way to Central or you're looking at $90 Hong Kong Dollars to Kowloon station. So that is about $11 to $12 USD dollars. Something else important to know is that they have free porters to help you bring on your luggage. Fancy. We didn't take advantage of that service. No one helped us with our bags. No but if you do have trouble getting your bags on to the train there is someone that is apparently available to help you do that. Good to know. That is really good to know. Um, an even cheaper option is the buses. And there is a bus called the a bus system called the Cityflyer and this is how we got back to the airport. From the city to the airport when we were leaving. Yeah and prices can range anywhere from 10 Hong Kong Dollars to 48. Ah, it is going to be closer to the forty eight range if you're leaving anywhere from the centre of Hong Kong (香港) which is what we did. And you're looking at like five to six US bucks for that. This is also quite a comfortable way to get to the airport. I remember I think it was air conditioned inside. I fell asleep so I don't remember much. Yeah, I mean they have a little section for you to put your luggage and yeah uh as long as there is not a lot of traffic then it is a fairly efficient way to get from the airport to the city or vice versa from the city back to the airport. So we can also recommend doing that. Especially if you want to save a little bit of money. And the last option that we have here is taking a taxi. Oh man. And that is going to cost you a lot. That is anywhere from 250 to 350 Hong Kong dollars. So you're looking at around forty maybe fifty US bucks to get you in to the city. And I guess the only time we'd recommend taking that is if you were in maybe like a super rush. Something like that. But otherwise why wouldn't you take the first two options. Save some money guys. So for accommodations you have a few different options but we're going to tell you right now it is going to be pricey. This is probably the most expensive city in all of Asia for accommodation. And you're not going to get a whole lot of space. If you watched our Hong Kong hotel room tour there is a shot where Sam is like touching the two walls. It was tiny. And like the beds were tiny as well. You kind of feel like a giant when you're in a typical Hong Kong hotel room. You do. But anyways your best bet if you're traveling on a budget would be a hostel. So how much would you say that is. So the dorm rooms can be anywhere from about 17 to 30 US dollars and the price range reflects on where you're staying and also the quality of the hostel. Yeah. So that is about as cheap as it gets. Also you can sometimes get like a really cheap flop house. What we call a flop house at that price. Which technically is your own room but it is almost like it is so small it is almost like a closet. Yeah. So you're not going to get a tonne of value at that price range. That is just like the rock bottom price for accommodations in Hong Kong (香港). So the next step up would be kind of like a budget or mid-range hotel. And that is what we did. Yeah. For our visit to Hong Kong (香港). Yeah. And well you paid. Tell us the price. Yeah, I think we were paying around sixty or seventy US dollars. And it was the nicest place we've ever stayed in Hong Kong. But it was super tiny. Nice. What was really cool about our particular room is that it had a really good shower. Yeah. But everything else was really small. Our bed was super tiny. Our desk was like almost a bit of a joke. Like I could barely sit down on the stool. But um yeah this is what you're going to pay and it is usually about 40 US dollars all the way up to a 100. So we were still on the lower range of that scale. I think our room was typically around 80 dollars but we found it on special so it had a bit of a discount. But still you don't get a lot of space for that amount of money. Yeah, I don't think you really start getting like typical small hotel space until you're spending at least probably over a 100 US dollars. So yeah. It is very expensive. Yeah. So the next option would be to do a luxury hotel. A luxury hotel. Yeah, how much would that be? 100s of dollars. Thousands of dollars. Well over two hundred and probably like anywhere from two hundred to five hundred to six hundred US dollars. Depending on location. Yeah, if you want to live it up you definitely can in Hong Kong (香港). Woo! And then the other option would be to do an AirBnB or an apartment rental. And between the thirty five and eighty dollar range you can usually get a room in someone's house. Um, closer to the eighty dollar range sometimes you can get a really small room but it is almost more like a hotel size. Like a tiny hotel. But then if you're bump it up to the 80 to 200 dollar range sometimes you can get a whole apartment or a studio. Something like that. So that is something to consider. We didn't do that on our trip but maybe in hindsight that might have been a good idea. So another place that you could consider staying in as a traveling on a budget is the infamous Chungking Mansions. Hahaha. Ooh. Yeah. Um, that place is scary. That place is it is kind of this sort of rundown building it is near the Tsim Sha Tsui (尖沙咀) area of Kowloon (九龍) and um yeah it is also a good place to get a curry. You can get some really good Indian food but I remember a few years back we were looking at rooms in there and it is like dark and damp and run down and super sketchy characters outside. Yeah but that is about as cheap as you're going to get. Yes. If you're looking for excellent. If you're looking for ultra hardcore backpacker beeline it to there. Yeah. But some other cool areas also on Kowloon (九龍) to consider is Mong Kong. It is a really cool busy area. You're nearby a lot of really good night markets. Lots of good restaurants. The Ladies Market. Yep. Yep. And also the Temple Street Night Market is nearby too. And if you want to go to Hong Kong Island (香港島) there was one time it was before I met you where I stayed at a hostel at Cow's Way Bay. Cow's way? Cow's way bay. Causeway Bay. Not Cow's Way Bay. Causeway Bay. So next up let's talk about transportation around the city. And Hong Kong is a place where you have like so many different types of transportation. You've got the ferry, you've got the subway, you have double decker buses. So plenty of options that is for sure. Trams. You've got it all. You've got it all. And the card that you're going to want to pickup to travel on all of those options is the Octopus Card. You can pick it up right from the airport and I think it is called the Octopus card because of the what the eight arms. 8 arms. Are there 8 modes of transportation in Hong Kong? I think so. I think that is what it is. I don't think I could list all 8 of them. Me neither. Anyways yeah you can pick it up right at the airport. Um, and then it is one of those reloadable cards that you can just deposit some money on it and it makes transportation so much more efficient because there are certain modes of transportation in Hong Kong where if you're paying by cash or coins you need the exact fare. Or you won't get anything back. Yeah. No change. Right. Right. So if you have the Octopus Card you avoid that. And it is also a really versatile card in the sense that you can use it for some museums, you can use it in certain convenience stores. Apparently you can use it in McDonald's. We didn't try that there but yeah it is one of those really highly versatile transportation travel cards. Well worth getting. So the transportation we actually ended up using the most especially when we were pressed for time was the MTR. Which is Hong Kong's metro subway system. And it is an awesome way to get around. It is cheap, it is efficient, it is clean. It can be extremely crowded during peak times. Oh yes. So try to avoid rush hour. Otherwise you are like a sardine squeezed into a can. Uh huh. Literally. And there was times where it was just so full we couldn't get on. We couldn't get on. Like the train just left and we were waiting for the next one. So had to try the next one. Yeah. So that is what the experience like is there. And moving on from there. So we talked a bit about the trams. Now this is probably in terms of like ground transportation this is my favorite way to see Hong Kong (香港). The double decker trams. And this is on Hong Kong Island and they are just so cool. It is just such an iconic and old fashioned of getting around the city. Especially if you can go up to the second level. And so the thing to note here is that you enter through the rear and your fare is paid. You pay your fare when you're actually exiting the tram. After your ride. So that is kind of cool. Um, so yeah definitely try to go up to the second level. Sometimes it can be a bit crowded on there as well. So if you see one that is really packed maybe let that one go by and hop on the next one. And in terms of the price there is a flat rate of Hong Kong dollars two dollars and thirty cents which in US dollars is about thirty cents. So it is ridiculously cheap to go on here. Um, this is somewhere where you'd want to pay with your Octopus Card or have exact change because they don't give change back on here. So another form of transportation you can consider in Hong Kong is the Peak Tram that takes you up to Victoria Peak where you get some amazing views over the city. Yeah. But that is actually a sightseeing attraction so we're going to mention that later. Yeah. And let's move on to Sam's favorite modes of transportation. My absolute favorite. The ferry! Yes, the Star Ferry going from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon crossing Victoria Harbor is just so so cool. Apparently, this is been in operation let me see here. I had it written down. So it has been going for over a 120 years. So it is it is I've mentioned this in our city guide. Like our things to do guide. I think it is the most iconic way of seeing Hong Kong. I believe it is an eleven minute ride and if I look at my notes here it is only like between two fifty and three forty Hong Kong Dollars. So you're talking like between thirty and fifty US cents to get on a ride. So it is just so cheap. It is such a fun way to experience the harbour and also the skyline in Hong Kong. Especially cool if you get on the Star Ferry during a Symphony of Lights laser show. Or at sunset. Yes, or at sunset. And um you know what it can be crowded during the rush hour but I find like during the middle of the day it is usually not very crowded at all. But even if it is crowded it is still something we recommend taking for sure. So now let's talk about free attractions in the city. There is quite a bit that you can do for free around Hong Kong (香港). So first up we would recommend checking out a Symphony of Lights and this is like a music and laser light show on the harbor. And it takes place both on Hong Kong Island (香港島) and Kowloon. Yep. But I would recommend being on Kowloon looking out to Hong Kong Island because they have a really cool skyline. And it just looks amazing once the lights come and it all starts flickering and flashing. It is really cool. So some other really cool free things to do in Hong Kong and this is really awesome because the museums. At least three museums are free on Wednesday. Oh. So the ones that you can go in to for free on Wednesday are the Hong Kong Heritage Museum, the Hong Kong Science Museum and the Hong Kong Museum of Art. So keep that in mind if you're going to be there. If you're going to be in Hong Kong for a whole week maybe plan your museum day on Wednesday. So for some great free views of Hong Kong we recommend going to Central Plaza. You can go up to the 46th floor which is called the Sky Lobby and there was hardly anyone there when we went. Like we were what maybe there was one other person. Yeah. Seriously. And you get incredible views looking out over the harbor and you can see the other really tall buildings and you get a great view of the skyline. It is awesome. You can actually get 360 degree views. You can walk around in a circle and it is all like glass windows from floor to ceiling. And you don't have to pay. I can't believe it is not more popular. It is really worth visiting. Yeah, it is really underrated. I would say it is the most underrated thing we did in Hong Kong. There is hardly anyone there when we visited in the morning. Alright, so moving on to something else that is free there is a lot of really cool parks you can visit in Hong Kong for free. Two of our favorites were Hong Kong Park which is a really nice park on Hong Kong Island. There is an aviary there is just a lot of really nice places to walk around. It is really lush, really green. It is kind of like this tiny little oasis escape in the middle of the city. It is kind of in the heart of the city. And then the next one we really liked was Kowloon Park which was on the side of Kowloon which is where we were staying basically. That is another really nice park. It is very big and very spread out. Um, highly recommend going for a walk there. So something else you can consider doing in Hong Kong is hiking. There are a lot of different hiking trails. One of the most famous being the Dragon's Back. Another place we really enjoyed visiting that was absolutely free except for getting there was the Tian Tan Buddha and the Po Lin Monastery. Admission to those two places is completely free to visitors. You just have to pay to take the cable car there. Right. Or if you want to go an even cheaper route and I did this several years ago, you can take the bus up there. And you don't have to wait in line for that unlike the cable car. Okay, the next one that we have here is the Temple Street Night Market. So obviously if you want to eat or shop you're going to pay some money but if you just want to take it in you can walk through the market for free. Um, the Noon Day Gun. This was the one attraction that I really wanted to do in Hong Kong (香港). I don't know why I liked it so much. It is a little bit quirky. Just every day at noon they fire this off. It is basically near Causeway Bay. And you have to go underground to get to there. You have to go through like an underground parking place. So two other places that we really enjoyed visiting were the Chi Lin Nunnery and the Nan Lian Gardens and the two are located right next to each other. They have beautiful gardens with like bonsai and waterfalls and lakes and it is just really quiet. Really pleasant. They play soft music while you're walking through the gardens. It is very tranquil. It is just a lovely place to go for a stroll. Yeah. And finally so we've done ten things here. 10 free things! It is the Avenue of Stars and unfortunately this is under construction at the moment. They are renovating. Hopefully by the time you visit it will be open again. And this is where you can see like the iconic Bruce Lee statue. Yeah and it is basically an area along the waterfront so you also get great views of the city from there. So we've talked about free attractions and now we're going to tell you about some attractions that you're going to have to pay for but these are iconic experiences in Hong Kong so you'll most likely want to dish out those bills. Yeah most definitely. So the thing we recommend doing the most obviously is taking the Peak Tram up to Victoria Peak. And that is like such a steep tram ride. It is like oh my gosh. It is like a rollercoaster. You're like lifting back. Seriously. Yeah, exactly and in terms of the price I have it written down here. So if you just do the Peak Tram only and not the observation deck which is what we did. You can get some really good free views when you go up top. It is going to cost you for a return ticket 45 Hong Kong Dollars. So that is just under 6 US dollars. So it is actually not that expensive and it is something that we highly recommend. Although it can be quite crowded lining up to get on it. Yes. So be prepared to wait a bit. And if you don't want to if you kind of want to beat the crowds then don't go right at night because that is probably the most popular time. Also it is really popular on the weekends. So considering going on a weekday maybe mid-afternoon before yeah sunset. It would be really good time to go. So now we're going to move on to our favorite part. The food and the eating and what should you eat. So first up we're going to recommend a really well known restaurant. Tim Ho Wan. They specialize in dim sum and they are a Michelin Star restaurant that is surprisingly affordable and the food is amazing. Yeah, and I just have to mention sorry for the construction noises. There is some building going on. Ah but yeah we'll just roll with it. Roll with it. But yeah Tim Ho Wan is really cool because it is affordable dim sum Michelin star quality and there is several locations so definitely check it out. But also don't be afraid to check out your local neighborhood dim sum place because dim sum is just awesome in Hong Kong and we ate it at several different restaurants while we were there. Yeah, we found a little local spot that actually had discounts if you ate mid-morning and mid-afternoon. Yeah, so it was like 15% off. 15% off. Sometimes our bill would be just like over 10 dollars for the two of us. Yeah, for a lot of dim sum. Yeah, so it is cheap. It is affordable, it is delicious. Oh man is it ever good. But aside from dim sum there are other cool foods that you can try. So what else? So in terms of other things you can have congee which is juk. It is kind of like a juk for breakfast but you can also get it anytime of day. So a juk is a porridge. You used a Korean word. Hahaha. Why is he speaking Korean? Yeah, I don't know why. But then you can also get roasted pork over rice which is also really delicious and there is also really nice baked goods. Like there is something called wife cake and then of course the iconic Hong Kong egg tarts. So yeah there is a lot of really good foods to try in Hong Kong. That is just a few of them. So now let's talk about a fancy meal. Not on this last visit but a few years ago we went out for afternoon tea at the Peninsula Hotel. Oh my. Yeah. That was not a good day for Sam because they do not allow you to make reservations. So we probably stood in line for two and a half hours and Sam was sulking and then he refused to come on camera and make a video about it. Yeah, I lost my cool that day. I mean it is a really awesome thing to do but you really need to be prepared to wait for a while. Yeah. And it is the most famous place to have tea in Hong Kong and it is cool. I mean it is popular for good reason. Yeah, I mean it is a beautiful setting. But. It is a beautiful hotel and they have classical music. Like there is people playing the harp and the violins. So it is fancy but long wait times and it is expensive. Right so I'm going to talk about the price right now. So for two people currently it is 658 Hong Kong Dollars which is roughly about $85 US dollars. So you're looking at tea. You're looking at over $40 dollars per person. It does come with a generous amount of finger sandwiches and yummy snacks but yeah it is not cheap. There is an alternative. There is a lot of alternative places to have tea in Hong Kong. And the place we ended up going to recently was a place called the Lion Rock. So what we did is we called them up for a reservation the same day that we went which is incredible. And we arrived on time, we were able to sit down right away and within minutes we were served our tea and we had really amazing set of sweets and savory foods as well. And that one was quite a bit cheaper. I have the price here. 428 Hong Kong Dollars for two people. Knock. Ready. And we are back. They came knocking to clean our rooms so we've actually been gone a few hours. We had lunch. Lunch. Met up with friends. We had a little siesta with friends. The lighting has changed. So we're not going to pretend we're just rolling seamlessly. Anyways, we were talking about tea. The price. The price. Afternoon tea. Right so the price of afternoon tea we were talking about at the Lion Rock and yep that is 428 Hong Kong Dollars for two people. And that is basically $54 US dollars so about $27 or $28 per person. Yeah, it is cheaper. A lot more affordable than the Peninsula we can tell you that. Yeah, the advantage are it is cheaper and more affordable and you can make a reservation, arrive and have it exactly at the time you booked. That is really nice. So next up we're going to talk about things we loved about Hong Kong. Yeah and there is quite a bit we loved about Hong Kong (香港). So the first being all of the free attractions. And we've already listed ten of those so we won't ramble on about that. But Hong Kong is just a city where almost most of the things we ended up doing ended up being free. Yeah and it kind of balances out nicely because accommodation is going to eat up a big chunk of your budget. Yeah. But then you can go sightseeing and not necessarily have to spend a lot of money. Yeah, you could literally plan the whole day just around free activities. So that is pretty awesome. Okay, next up. Second, dim sum. And I wrote in my notes dim sum is amazing. Haha. And it is. Haha. I don't know what else to say beyond that. It is just such tasty food. It is cheap. And it is just all over Hong Kong. And you know what with dim sum you can eat it anytime of day. Right. We were having this for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Sometimes it is like a mid-afternoon snack. Let's get dim sum. Yeah, exactly. It is such a versatile meal. You can have it for lunch or you can have it as a snack. Exactly. And we ate it a lot. Okay number three. Most diverse and interesting options of transportation in any city we've visited. Like I can't think of any other city where you can take a ferry, where you can take a tram, where you can take the metro, where you can be in a cable car or you can take a steep peak tram going up. It is just options galore and everything is really efficient. Everything is cheap and affordable. And that is what is awesome about Hong Kong is it is so easy to get around and there is so many different options you can choose from. My suggestion would be to try them all. Especially the tram and the star ferry. Another thing we loved about Hong Kong is the views. Like I think this is a city that has such an iconic skyline. Yeah. Especially at night when the lights come on. It is really amazing. Yeah, it is cool and if you keep revisiting the city it is always changing. There is always a new building. Skyscrapers. Yep. Yeah, it is amazing by day and also by night. So and from different vantage points. It is really cool from Victoria Peak and it is great on Kowloon where you can see like the laser and a Symphony of Lights show. Like there is just so many different cool vantage points where you can see the skyline and like we mentioned it is totally iconic. So number five, Hong Kong is a dynamic city and there are not too many comparisons. Like it is just an assault on the senses. Exactly. And there is just so many people, there is so much going on in terms of transportation. It is just a very exciting city. You can feel the pulse of the city almost anywhere all the time. Anytime of day. But you know what? That can be a good and a bad thing. So now this is going to be our transition into things we didn't necessarily love about Hong Kong. And there were a few. So I would say number one for me is the crowds. There are certain areas in the city or certain times of day where it can feel quite claustrophobic. Yep. And we've also been in Hong Kong before during holidays and festivals. Ooh. Celebrations. Yeah we were in Mong Kong and like there was times where we would look out our apartment window and we're not going to even bother going out. Yeah. It just looked like ants scurrying across the street. Yeah at night. And as an example I remember a few years ago we decided we wanted to go to the movies on a Friday or a Saturday night. It was probably like six or seven PM so we thought oh we'll just walk over to the movie theatre and buy a ticket. And we got there and everything was sold out. For the whole day. For the whole night. Nothing. It is a place where there are so many people that sometimes you need to actually like make reservations and bookings in advance if there is something you really want to do. Yeah, exactly so it is a bit of a double edged sword. You can get swept up by the excitement of the city but is also can be overwhelming especially when you're feeling a little rundown or a little tired. Maybe a little sick. All the crowds can be really overwhelming. Okay so the next thing is uh I'll just perfectly blunt it is some of the worst value accommodations you'll find in Asia. For what you spend like you're just getting very cramped type of quarters and unless you're willing to splurge and Hong Kong might be the city that if you've been if you have the resources to splurge it might be worth it. Yeah. Because we don't. You really pay for what you get and at our price range that we paid. It is quite a bit higher than what we paid in a lot of other cities in Asia. We had paper thin walls, we could touch our walls. Babies crying at night. Couples fighting. We didn't have one good sleep to be honest because there was babies crying at night and then there was construction during the day. So that was a it weared on us over time. The accommodations. And the last thing is that uh nightlife and fine dining can get a little bit pricey. And you would expect that in a big developed city like Hong Kong. So I just like if you're going out for drinks it is going to be pricey. It is a lot cheaper to get your drinks from a convenience store and have them at home. Yeah but I would still experience the nightlife. At least once. I think it is a city that you have to experience at least once in your life. It is truly impressive. It is amazing and it is just so iconic. So I would say go to Hong Kong but maybe save up your cash so you can actually have fun, stay in the types of hotels you want to and maybe splurge on a few experiences and really enjoy it. And if you're someone that doesn't have enough money for like a more expensive accommodations than just plan to be out most of the day. You don't want to spend a lot of time in your room. If it is that small. Yeah. Anyways we recommend going to Hong Kong. We loved it. We've been there many times and we will probably be back in the future. So those are our tips for Hong Kong. We hope you found some of this information helpful. If there is anything else you want to know about this city maybe leave us a question in the comments below and we'll try to answer that. Exactly. If not if you're a local feel free to answer those in the comments. Because yeah we are just visitors and the local perspective is always better. So yeah signing off and do visit Hong Kong if you get the chance. See you later.

As two self-proclaimed foodies who are always on the hunt for the next meal, we loved the amazing mix of restaurants and street markets the city had to offer. On top of that, there were plenty of temples, museums, and nature escapes to keep us busy throughout the day, so we actually managed to pack quite a bit into our trip. With this video, we’re going to show you 30 things to do in Taipei, Taiwan (中華民國), and you can count on a few foodie recommendations to be sprinkled throughout. Now let’s get started. Let’s start with the city’s most iconic landmark: Taipei 101 (臺北101 / 台北101). Well good morning. Today the skies have finally parted. It has stopped raining. So we're going to visit the attraction we've been waiting for. We're heading to Taipei 101 (臺北101 - 台北101). This was the tallest building in the world at one point. It no longer is so yeah it should be fun and we should be able to get some great views of the city. So we have the tickets. You paid. You do the math. So it is 600 Taiwan dollars each. So you're basically looking at just under twenty US bucks. About nineteen dollars. So not cheap but I think it is going to be worth it. So we made it to the top. Yeah, that was crazy. So it took thirty seven seconds. When we both got off we thought man that felt like it was only like five or ten seconds. I know. And to get up that high it didn't feel like it is as powerful as you would think. It was still really smooth. It was very smooth but my ears did pop. Once you finish visiting Taipei 101, you’ll exit inside the Taipei 101 mall which is also worth the visit. This is a mall with high end brands and designer labels, and it’s probably the most luxurious mall we’ve ever set foot in. So if you're looking for panoramic views of Taipei that also include Taipei 101 you'll want to climb Elephant Hill (象山). We're currently struggling here. They call it a hike but really it is just hundreds of stairs and you're just climbing stairs the whole time. But we're starting to get nice views. Just catching our breath now. So I think the hardest part was probably the humidity not even the steps. Yeah. Sam, what did you think? I'm sweating profusely. I think I see some little drips there on your forehead. Little? I'm like totally drenched in my shirt. I'm so glad we brought water because we weren't initially planning to do this one today. Yeah. Good idea to put some water in my backpack. Next, we visited Liberty Square which is flanked by the National Theater to the north, the National Concert Hall to the south, and the Freedom Square Memorial Arch to the west. These structures are impressive enough on their own, but the main reason you come here is to see Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall (中正紀念堂) which was erected in memory of the former president of the Republic of China. You can also watch a changing of the guard ceremony at the memorial, but try to get there early, otherwise you’ll be several rows of people deep. Another place to visit in Taipei (臺北市 - 台北市) is the National Revolutionary Martyrs’ Shrine (國民革命忠烈祠), which was built to honour the soldiers who died during the War of Resistance against Japan, the Civil War between Nationalist and Communist China, and the First and Second Taiwan Strait Crises. You can also watch the changing of the guard here. So we have just arrived at the Shilin Night Market (士林夜市) and it is still quite early. It is 4:30 PM. Most of the stalls start opening closer to five o'clock and things will only continue to get busier as the night goes on. And apparently this market can run until like one or two in the morning. So yeah, still very early. We were hungry so we couldn't wait any longer. If you’re a foodie, you’ll definitely enjoy Shilin Night Market. There are food options galore and there’s enough variety that you can turn all the snacking into a full meal. If your taste buds are feeling adventurous, be sure to track down stinky tofu! So Sam is leading the way with this one. What are we having next? Alright moment of truth. We've been playing it kind of tame. Playing it kind of safe so far. We're going right in to the classic Taiwanese street food (台湾街头食品) here. We are having Stinky Tofu (臭豆腐). I'm going to go take a bite here. Yeah. I think there is some cabbage. You can see it is on a double skewer here. Yeah, a double skewers and it has got cabbage in the middle. Somewhat like a sandwich. Oh my. A little overpowering there. That is something else. Oh. It is spicy. Um. Oh man. I'm keeping my distance. It is just you really taste the sourness of it. And the fermented aspect and woah. That is something that would take a while to get used to. I don't think I'm ever going to enjoy this one to be honest. One of my favourite outings in Taipei was riding the Maokong Gondola (貓空) up to the hills. The route is 4.3 kilometres long and we rode in a cabin with glass floors, which was kind of scary but cool at the same time. And of course because this is Taipei (臺北市 - 台北市) it started raining again as soon as we got off the Gondola. So I think we're going to pop in for some tea. There are lots of little teahouses around here. So yeah, we're going to stay dry and I hope the rain stops. Sam is stealing my order. He saw that I was ordering something really tasty and he was like that is what I'm getting. Yeah, well. Copycat! You're taking the good one. Copycat! I'm copycat-ing. Why not? So we've found a teahouse with a view. We've got Taipei 101 off in the distance. There she be. And we also have nice lush greenery all around us. And we feel really far removed away from the city which is quite a nice feeling. It doesn't actually take that long to get away from the city centre and to be out in nature. Which is something I really like. We may have gone a little overboard. We ordered two different kinds of teas. One coffee and lots of Taiwanese desserts. This one is actually Sam's. I believe it is Taguen if I'm pronouncing that correctly. Yeah, Taguin or Taguin tea. We asked what was the local tea and they suggested this one. This is the one. So we have to let it steep for two minutes and then we can pour it. And then look at the snack plate that we have. We've got cookies, we've got dried fruit, we've got something that looks like mango. Yeah yeah. Oh man it looks so good Oh my. It looks like is that one with peanuts or something? Maybe? Wow. I'm going to wait for my tea and then we'll dig in to this. Already getting in to the snacks. Yeah, I already had one of these. This is awesome. This is like one of those uh sweet and sour dried plums. Oh, I love these. Mmmmm. You're just popping them like candy. Mmmm. They are really good. Um, they have a large pit in the middle but really sweet inside. Um, just so flavorful. You look like you're having a moment over there. I am. Dessert time. What are you trying first? This cookie. I really hope it is peanut butter. Please be peanut butter. Mmmm. What is it? Not peanut butter. Not peanut butter? Is it sweet? Yeah but I can't identify what it is. But it is not peanut butter. Hahaha. Well why would it be? Hahaha. That is not a thing in Taiwan (中華民國) is it? I'm going to try this one. I think it is puffed rice. It is light in the hand and sticky. Mmmmm. Yep. Nice and crunchy. Sweet on the outside. Mmmm. I like it. And now there is one more left to try. That little green one. Please be wasabi. Please be wasabi. Haha. It is probably going to be matcha. Mmmmm. That is like a crumbly I don't know if you'd call it a cookie it is more like a cake. Is it green tea flavored? No, it is not. Is it wasabi. No, it is not. It is sweet. It is really good though. On the way back from the gondola, you’ll exit next to the Taipei Zoo (臺北市立動物園), which is a family-friendly attraction in the city. We are now visiting the Beitou Hot Springs (北投溫泉) and it smells like rotten eggs. Doesn't smell very pretty but it does look pretty cool. So we can't go swimming in that very spot because it is over seventy five degrees Celsius and that would kind of cook you up. Hahaha. Um, haha. That would not be fun. So we're visiting Guandu Nature Park (關渡自然公園) and it is nice to get out in nature here obviously but we're hoping to also spot some birds as well today. So Sam is being way too loud in this park and all the birds keep flying away before he can spot them. So Sam are you spotting any birds or are you scaring them away? Probably a bit of both. Like I spotted a few but I didn't have my camera ready so it was a bit of a photography fail. But we just started so I still am confident we can find some. I think you're being too loud. That is why the birds keep flying away. So Sam spent so much time in nature that he just confused a bird call for the sound of a construction truck. Hahaha. What? How is that possible? Hey, the construction trucks sound a little different over here I guess. I don't have any excuses. Tamshui (淡水區) is a seaside district that’s 40 minutes north of Taipei, so we thought we’d include it in this list. The bike path along the waterfront makes it perfect for a day trip on a sunny day. So this is pretty cool. We just rented bikes outside of the station and I did math wrong. So I thought it was ten dollars for an hour which I thought was great but it turns out it is only a little over a dollar and you get the bicycle for a whole hour and you can just ride along the waterfront so yeah that is what we're going to be doing. And it is a beautiful day to be out after all that rain. So the biking was a lot of fun. I mean we covered quite a bit of territory in just one hour. Really cool just going out and seeing people fishing, you see people out shopping doing different things. Just it is nice and quiet out here. Yeah, and there are museums and cultural attractions. We didn't really visit many of them because we would have had to get off of our bikes and we didn't have a lock for that so yeah we just kind of focussed on the bike ride which was fun though still. If you don’t want to go all the way to Tamshui (淡水區), you can also explore Taipei (臺北市 - 台北市) by bike with the U-Bike share system that has kiosks across the city. Today we're on a bit of a food mission. We've been hearing about Din Tai Fung (鼎泰豐 - 鼎泰丰). Apparently, they specialize in soup dumplings. So that is what we're going to try today. We absolutely love dumplings so any excuse for us to eat dumplings is always a good one and yeah it is another rainy day in Taipei (臺北市) so we figured let's plan our day around food. Let's go eat. Yes, and this place opens at ten in the morning and we are expecting huge lines. So we're here early let's go get in line. Alright so before coming here we were reading the history of the place and apparently the man who started this Yang he used to run a shop where he sold cooking oil and like that was his business but apparently when that industry started to change and people weren't buying as much cooking oil anymore he had to come up with a new business idea so he and his wife decided okay we're going to sell soup dumplings and like they became such a huge hit that today they have locations not only across Taipei (臺北市) and Taiwan (中華民國) but also around the world in places like LA, Hong Kong. So yeah, pretty cool story and now we're waiting for the food. This is the look of excitement. So the star of the meal has arrived. The Xiaolongbao (小笼包 - 小籠包) is here on the table in real life. And this is cool. So you eat it with a special sauce and they actually give you instructions on how it is done. How to enjoy Xiao long bao (小笼包 - 小籠包). This is how you eat it. Um, and they basically explain how to prepare the sauce so we're going to try our hand at this. The waiter actually wanted to make it for us and we're like no. We are filming this. Haha. So allow me to demonstrate. Okay so first up we have our little plate with ginger right here. So it says put some soy sauce and vinegar. So it is one part soy sauce. One part soy sauce. And three parts vinegar. I'd say that is about three parts vinegar. Next up we grab our little Xiaolongbao (小笼包 - 小籠包) and dip it into the sauce. Once it has been dipped we place it on the spoon. Let us see what is next. Oh, let's not forget you have to poke a little hole to let out the soupy broth that is hiding in there. Can you see that. Oh my gosh. Oh wow look at it seeping out. Pouring out. And then then you take some of the ginger from the plate add it on top and it all goes in in one bite. Is that too big for one bite? Try. Mmmm. Is that tasty? Wow. That is amazing. That is so juicy. Oh man. Is that one of the best dumplings you've ever had? It really is. I'm so glad we came here and stood in line. This is worth it. So next up we're visiting the National Palace Museum (國立故宮博物院). It is still drizzling if you can believe that. But at least the sun has also come out. So a little bit warmer. We've got some rainbows and yeah we're just going to visit this place. Okay so we had a slight change of plans. It was really crowded to go into the museum and they actually had lines to visit some of the galleries so we decided to scrapt that. We're not going in and we're visiting the Zhishan Gardens (至善園) instead which are right next door. It is really cheap to get in and yeah it is so peaceful. Hardly anyone in sight. Another thing to do in Taipei is to visit the Lungshan Temple (艋舺龍山寺). This is a Buddhist temple that was built by Chinese settlers from Fujian, in honour of Guanyin, also known as the Goddess of Mercy. Now, it’s been a while since we talked about food in this video, so let’s hop over to the Raohe Street Night Market (饒河夜市). This market was even more geared towards foodies than the Shilin Night Market, which we had previously visited. We had baked pork buns, egg tarts, cartoon-shaped waffles, chicken steak, as well as a few mysterious snacks, however, the most memorable was the liquid nitrogen ice cream. Please put the whole cookie deep in your mouth and chew it. So what are you having Audrey? It is smoking. Smoking cookie. I have to put this whole thing in my mouth, chew with my teeth and not with my tongue. Alright. Woah! It is smoking out of your mouth. Haha. You look like a dragon. Haha. Is it good? It is cold. It is like ice. Oh wow. It kind of gets stuck to your tongue. That is why they tell you to eat it with your teeth and eat it fast. And while we’re on the topic of food, let us show you what a typical Taiwanese breakfast looks like. So this is a wheat cake with sesame seeds on the exterior and it has an omelet inside. And for those of you with a sweet tooth, allow us to introduce you to Mango Shaved Ice. Alright, so our dessert has arrived. And it is standing room only at this particular spot. So they've got like this little bar outside where you just bring your dessert, you eat it here but check this out. Yeah, because all of the tables are full. I know it is packed with people and there is a huge line of people ordering. So this is it. This is the Mango Snowflake Ice (Xue hua bin - 雪花冰). It is a mountain. Like this is huge. And we went for the classic so it is just mango and panna cotta on top. But I mean they probably have like ten different flavors with like strawberries and chocolate and red beans and you can choose anything. Okay, so I'm just going to try and get a bit of everything. Oh wow. The ice is melting a bit already. I know you have to be fast with this because it just starts melting on the spot. Okay, I'm going to get some mango. So I've got a little bit of everything now. Mmmm. What do you think? Oh yeah, that is really sweet. You taste. You really taste the shaved ice, you really taste the syrup and the nice big chunks or mango. Fresh mango. It reminds me of something we had in Korea not too long ago called Sulbing (설빙). Yeah, which is their shaved ice dessert (Bao Bing - 刨冰 - 礤冰)) and yeah it is really good. Um, I think I would enjoy this even more on a hot day as opposed to a cool one like this but it is still a lot of fun and still really enjoying it. We also made sure to try a dish that’s a local favourite: beef noodle soup. We're going to be trying beef noodle soup (牛肉麵 - 牛肉面) and this is a super popular dish. We plotted a whole bunch of places on our phone and finally settled on one. So let's go find Jian Hong Beef Noodles (建宏牛肉麵). Let's go. Alright, so the food is already here. It came out super quickly. We ordered two bowls and this is a small portion but you know what? I think this is going to be pretty filling for one person. It is pretty big for a small portion. Yeah. I was kind of worried we wouldn't be able to get a table because it is already eleven thirty in the morning. So kind of close to lunch but there is still plenty of space so that is good. Um, but yeah, anyways let's have a look. A closer look at the meal. So here you have it. So it is a noodle soup with a beef broth and these chunks of meat on top. Those are really generous chunks of meat. I know. Yeah, it is a lot thicker than I would have imagined. Yeah. And the beef it can be tendon, brisket or shank. And again I was worried this was going to be all tendon. I'm not a huge fan of tendon so I'm glad to see like some really nice cuts of meat in here with not a whole lot of fat. So yeah, I'm going to grab some chopsticks right here. Lots of what appears to be chives. Green onions as well. Yeah, chives on top. So let's do this. Let's try this. Putting my noodles on a spoon perhaps. Mmm. That is good. They look thick. Mmmm. They are quite thick yeah. They are nice. A little chewy. They've been soaking in the beef broth so that is nice. Let's go for some noodles and meat now. Oh my. This is messy. I do not have a talent for noodles and chopsticks. My goodness. Haha. Why don't you try the meat? Both of them. Noodles and meat. Okay. So you're getting the noodles on there. Got the noodles. Ooh, okay. You know what? Let's just go with the meat guys. The chopsticks aren't helping me today. Mmmm. Oh wow. It is like really salty and savory. Mmm. You like that? Mmmm. It is quite tender as well. Yeah, this has been cooking for a while. This is good. Pleasantly surprised over here. If I had to describe Huashan 1914 Creative Park (華山1914文化創意產業園區) in 2 words, it would be hipster central. This place was once a winery, but today it’s a multi-purpose space that draws artists looking to showcase plays, films, art, photography, and so much more. We also noticed it’s really popular with Instagrammers - seriously, there were photoshoots happening every few steps! So if you happen to be in Taipei on a rainy day you can check out the National Taiwan Museum (國立台灣博物館). However, if you're here on a rainy day and a Monday like we are you're out of luck. We're only going to be able to show you the exterior and that is about it. Another place to visit is the 228 Peace Memorial (二二八和平紀念公園 / 二二八和平纪念公园) located in the same park as the National Taiwan Museum. It commemorates the victims of what is known as the February 28 Incident, which began on the same date and saw thousands of civilians killed for taking part in an anti-government uprising. So next up we're at Hsing Tiang Temple (行天宮) which you can see right behind me. And this temple has more of a local feel. You don't see as many tourists here and the temple is dedicated to the patron Saint of Businessmen. So I'm guessing lots of businessmen are probably going to be in here praying and getting blessings. So let's go check it out. We also made time to visit the Taipei Expo Park (花博公園), which is a multi-purpose park just north of the city centre that hosts different events and exhibitions. From there, it’s just a skip and a hop to the Taipei Fine Arts Museum (台北市立美術館), which focuses on modern and contemporary art; and while you’re at it, you can also visit Taipei Story Museum (台北故事館), which is a house that was built in the English tudor style by a tea merchant, and now holds exhibits related to tea and local history. The street food adventures continue and we are going to be eating at the Ningxia Night Market (寧夏夜市). So this is our third night market here in Taipei (臺北市) and I feel like there is still a lot of Taiwanese street food we haven't tried. So we're going to be on a mission to try a whole bunch of new stuff tonight. You may be tired of hearing about night markets and street food at this point, but indulge us once more for our third and final market visit in Taipei. In Ningxia Night Market, we sampled a shrimp stick stuffed with cheese, Chinese Scallion pancakes, flaming beef (yes, they cooked it with a blow torch!), Papaya Milk Smoothies, Cheese Potato, and coffin bread. Now wrapping up this video, here’s a quick note on transportation. Travel tip for Taipei. Yeah, so pretty much the easiest way to get around Taipei is by the MRT (台北捷運) and if you're going to come here you'll want to pick up an EasyCard (悠遊卡). We paid a hundred Taiwanese dollars for this. Which is about three US dollars right now. And then you can load it reload it. It helps you save on fares and the best part is you don't have to keep getting single purchase fares every time you go to the station. And that’s it for our visit to Taipei! We hope you enjoyed this video and that you got a few of idea of things to do, see, and most importantly, eat on your next visit. As always, if you have any other suggestions of fun things to do around Taipei, we invite you to share them with travellers in the comments below. Wishing you happy travels and until next time! Alright guys, so if you've been watching our channel for the last few weeks you've probably noticed that we've filmed a lot in Taipei (臺北市). So we thought for today's video we would share some tips. Yep. And some costs. Because a lot of people asked how expensive is Taipei? Or how much money did we spend and do you have any tips. So today it is going to be more of a practical video with a lot of information. Yeah, exactly and the cool thing is you guys suggested we do this and we're really excited to do it. We listened. We listened. Also, we have a lot of information to share so we had to make notes on the computer. You're probably going to catch us staring down but it is just because otherwise it is a lot of prices to remember. Yeah, we don't want to miss out on stuff. So let's get started. First up we're going to talk about transportation from the airport in to Taipei (臺北市). So we have a few different options. Yeah, so we're looking down at the screen so the first option is taking the Express Airport Bus. And that is what we did. We ended up doing that and it is probably the cheapest and maybe one of the most convenient ways to get around. Yeah. So I'm looking here and the price range is between 120 and 150 New Taiwan Dollars which means it runs for about four to five US bucks. Yeah. So basically when you exit in the arrivals gate just go to the information desk and ask them about the bus and they'll point you in the right direction. And then once you get to the right stand you just need to let them know where in the city you are going and they'll tell you what stop you need to get off at and they will charge you accordingly. Yeah, it is awesome. Super easy. You don't even have to know which bus number you're going on. They have that figured out for you. Next option. Alright so moving on there is the high speed rail station located at the airport and the cool thing I'm looking here is that we didn't do this so I have to look at my notes here so it takes 25 minutes to get from the airport to the main train station. Which is pretty amazing. That is a really fast ride. Yeah. And the train station in Taipei is a really central location so that might be your best bet. Then you would have to transfer either to the subway or the bus. Yeah. Because I mean your hotel may not be next to the main train station. Right. So it might involve multiple types of transportation. I'm seeing that the price here is a 165 New Taiwan Dollars which is under $6 US bucks. So again not bad. Pretty cheap. It would be a really efficient way to get in to the city and probably quite fun. I always like, we like taking trains. Actually Sam. Next up. Alright, okay so we're moving up in price. This is the Airport Shuttle. Um, I guess this is probably a little bit more comfortable. It says door to door service to all hotels in Taipei City. So yeah, that is pretty fancy but you are going to be paying more. I'm noticing the price is 350 New Taiwan Dollars which puts you at over $11 US dollars per person. So yeah, that is a big bump up in price. And a real big bump up in price is the next option. The taxi. The taxi. And that is going to cost you from anywhere from 900 to 1200 New Taiwan Dollars. So you are looking at the 30 to 40 US dollar price range. And that is if you're staying in the city centre. Yeah, honestly I would probably go for first option. Yep. Because the bus was very comfortable, easy to find, they dropped us off where we needed to go. So yeah. Super affordable too. Super affordable and yeah I've done that I've been to Taipei (臺北市) twice. You've been once. And I've done that service twice. Great service. Okay that is transportation and next let's move on to accommodations. What type of accommodations are you going to stay in in Taipei? So let's start with the cheapest. Hostels. And that is always the hostel. Always hostels. Almost anywhere in the world is a hostel. And looking at my notes here you can stay at a hostel for anywhere between 400 to 600 New Taiwan Dollars and so that's between 12 to 20 US bucks. And that makes sense because when I went in 2010 I stayed at one of the cheapest hostels and it was 10 US dollars so like six or seven years later the cheapest one is about 12 bucks. Yeah, that sounds about right. You'll probably get a bed in a dorm so you may be sharing the space with a few different travelers. Yep. But if you're traveling solo that can be a really fun way to meet people. So it is an option. Yeah. Next option is between 2 to 3 star hotels and at that price you're looking at between $40 to $100 US dollars. What we went for this time was actually an AirBNB rental and we often use AirBnB when we travel. So we got what would you call it? Like a studio? Yeah, it was kind of like a studio apartment. It had more features than a typical hotel. Like we had our own washer. We had a tiny kitchen. Yeah. We had actually everything else was the same as a hotel except for those two things. Yeah. We had a little kitchen and a little washer and a place to hang up our clothes. Which is really nice. It meant that we could do our own laundry. Because we were staying there for over a week so yeah we did laundry every other day and that meant we had nice clean clothes. We had a kitchen we were prepared our breakfasts so that was pretty nice. Yeah. And we did that. We bought some local fruit. We did stuff like that. So this type of place when you have your own kitchen it allows you to save a little bit of money because it is one less meal that you have to spend at a restaurant. And you know what? The Air BNB rental was actually slightly cheaper than staying in a hotel room and we had more space. Yes. Sounds pretty cool. So price wise. So yeah pricewise it was like we paid I think it was about 50 bucks a night and 40 to 60 dollars gets you that type of place in Taipei. Oh and our Airbnb was like right outside the metro station. Yes. Literally. Like you had the exit and then our building was right next door so it was amazing for transportation. So the cool thing about Taipei (臺北市) is that it has one of the most amazing metro systems we've ever used. And our biggest tip is not so much where you're going to stay. There is not a particular neighborhood we'd recommend but do get a place that is within walking distance of a metro. Because that is going to allow you to get anywhere in the city super efficiently. Alright so, moving that ties in nicely to what we're doing because we're going to talk about transportation. Alright. And the only thing that we recommend doing for transportation in Taipei is to the take the Taipei Metro also known as the MRT. Yep. And you got an EasyCard for that. Right. EasyCard is awesome. I'm looking over here just to confirm the price. Yeah, the Easy Card is a 100 New Taiwan Dollars which is just over 3 US bucks. Amazing card to have. Not only can you use it to get around on the metro but you can also use it for museums, yeah for a few attractions around the city. The zoo. The zoo. The Maokong Gondola. So taking the cable car and also you can also use it to rent the public bikes too. Yeah, so it is like multifunctional. Multipurpose. It is one of the most versatile transportation cards you can ever pick up. Like it is just awesome. Oh and the other cool thing and this is really important is you save 20% on your fares. So fares start at 20 New Taiwan Dollars which is like what 60 or 70 US cents. And you get your 20% discount and that brings it down to you're starting off at like 50 cents which is 16 NTD. And Sam loves discounts. Yeah. That is why he got the card. So yeah it is going to save you money thought especially if you're there for a few days. And there is an option here I'm just looking down here you can get a one day pass. And we didn't do this obviously because we stayed for a while but if you pay a 200 Taiwanese Dollars which is under 7 US bucks that gives you unlimited rides on the MRT but it does. I'm looking here at the notes. It does not include the Maokong Gondola. Womp womp. So yeah. But anyways I can't stress enough how cool this MRT is. It is so clean, so efficient, on time. Gets you anywhere in the city within minutes. It has a fun little jingle. Yeah. We loved it. We took it go everywhere. If we couldn't walk there we where we taking the MRT. So you've probably already watched our city guide of things to do in Taipei but we wanted to highlight a few activities that are free. If you're not looking to spend any money whatsoever. Right. So number 1 if you don't want to go up Taipei 101 but you want cool views of the city you can actually climb the Elephant Hill and we show that in our video. It involves a whole lot of stairs. Yeah. You're probably going to be sweaty but you can get pretty high up and then you just get these amazing landscape views of Taipei. I'd do that in the morning or late afternoon. Yes. Because you will be hot and sweaty if you do it midday. Haha. The humidity in Taipei is off the charts. Okay, the second thing and this is something we did a lot of is you've got to check out the night markets and eat the street food in Taipei (臺北市). Yes. It is legendary. There are so many to choose from. We went to some of the more famous ones. Shilin, Ningxia and Raohe. Yeah those are the three we went to. There is more. There is more within the city centre. There is also more that you can visit like on a daytrip. Yeah, so those markets. I mean markets are free to visit so it is just a matter of how much you end up spending on food there. So again if you're on a budget it is a really great place to go for your meals. We are going to number 3. That is the Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall. One of the most like iconic famous places to visit in the city. Um, it is just is definitely worth a visit. Yeah, it is free. You can go there to watch the changing of the guard. Yep. It does get quite crowded and I would also recommend going either early in the morning or late in the afternoon because when the sun is shining down on like that white marble or whatever it is like it kind of burns. It is so hot like you really feel the heat shining back in your face. You get baked. It is a really intense. You get baked. So yeah early in the day is best. Another free attraction you can visit are the Beitou Hot Springs. And you do have to pay if you want to go in to some of the private springs. It is just a small fee to go in so yourself. But if you just want to enjoy the springs and like look at them. Take pictures. That is also free. Yeah an important thing to note about that is that is kind of on the outskirts of the city. That is not in the city centre. So that takes a little. It is a little bit longer to get to. But it is one of the. It is definitely wired from downtown. And the last one is probably one of the most famous temples in all of Taipei (臺北市). It is the Longshan Temple. Longshan. So yeah check that place out. So those are the five things that we recommend. For free! For free. And so the next section that we have are the must do things in the city. Things that you're going to have to pay for. Yeah, you will pay for these but do not miss them. And number one is Taipei 101. Of course. One of the coolest buildings we've ever seen anywhere. Like not just the outside design of it is awesome but it is also just an amazing building to go in to. There is it is really nice. Really new and modern. So in terms of the price of visiting it is only 600 New Taiwan Dollars which is under $20 US bucks at the current moment. So a little bit pricy but I mean it is the most iconic site in all of Taipei so I think it is worth paying for it. Next is the Gondola ride. That was fun. I think that was probably our favorite activity right? On a personal level. Yeah. It is just gorgeous to go on this gondola ride. You are out in nature and yeah you just get like when you arrive it is so cool you can get a really cool view of like the city way off in the distance. And it is also a great place to have a Taiwanese tea. Yeah, so you're up in the hills and they have a lot of different teahouses you can visit so if you want something close to nature to just have a very chill and relaxed day you can go have tea and enjoy the views, walk around so it is pretty cool. And that costs. It is a 120 New Taiwan Dollars which is the equivalent of $4 US dollars to get there. Yeah. Each way. And as we mentioned before you can use your EasyCard. So if you have enough credit it is an awesome way to do it. We're moving on to must eat foods. What do you have to eat in Taiwan (中華民國). Let's see. Oh my gosh so we're going back to night markets. And my gosh there is just an endless supply of things to try. You have everything from these exotic like stinky tofu. Ew. To like tame stuff like there is a lot of really good desserts. Ice cream there is different types of chicken. There is different types of fish. If you guys really want to see all of the different options of foods to eat you have to check out our three different street food markets that we hit. Anyways price point for these street food snacks. Yeah, so you can pay anywhere between 20 to 150 New Taiwan Dollars and that is range is from under 1 US dollar all the way up to 5 US bucks. And the only time we paid that much was for like expensive more expensive meat and fish items. Most things slotted in between the 30 and 90 price point which is between $1 to $3 US bucks. So man, you could if you have a budget of ten US dollars per person. You can eat well. You can very well and you will be stuffed by the time you leave. Okay, so that is a must. The next one is Din Tai Fung. If you're going all the way to Taipei (臺北市) you need to try Xiaolongbao. These special pork soup dumplings. They are amazing. And they are really affordable for a restaurant with so much hype. It is a Michelin Star restaurant. Michelin Star. And this it is safe to say this was our favorite restaurant in Taipei. We went back again and again and again. I think we went back three or four times. Many times. Five times. Something like that. And we found that like if you're spending between $7 to $12 US dollars per person you're going to be eating really well. So again really quite affordable and the only thing is we had to line up. Yes. The lines are really long so go early or go outside of meal times. Like go in the middle of the afternoon and then maybe you can get in really quick. Right. So this is the fun part. We are going to talk about the things we liked about Taipei (臺北市). And then disliked. Dun dun dun. Yeah, we're going to every guide we do we are going to talk about the things we liked and disliked. Loved and hated. Let's start with the positives. Alright, so number one. And this is the third time we're talking about this. But the night markets and street food in Taipei are legendary. Like Taipei I would say I would call it the foodie capital of Asia. Yeah. Like I don't think the only other city I've been to where they are that passionate about food is Lima in Peru. And that is not in Asia. Haha. So I mean you have night markets that are running every single day. You have an endless supply of food to try. It is all really affordable. And we also saw that people are willing to line up for food. Yeah. It is crazy. People will stand in line to eat at this one particular restaurant because they specialize in something and it is amazing. Even for street food too. So I mean that is a really good way to find out where you should be eating when you go to these night markets. If there is a line that means it is good. Another thing we really enjoyed about Taipei (臺北市) was proximity to nature. So it didn't take very long to ride the MRT out of the city and just find yourself like in a nature reserve where you can see wildlife and birds or like to be out in the hot springs. Yeah or the Maokong Gondola. Or the gondola. Yeah or even the day we went out to Tamshui and we went biking along the waterfront. That was so much fun. So yeah, you're never too far from the city centre. And you're never too far from nature. Sorry that is what I meant to say. You are never too far. You can escape the city center really easily. Yes. Okay next one is ah yeah I want to talk about the awesome metro system. The MRT. One of the best we've ever used anywhere in the world. Just fantastic, efficient, cheap, clean. Clean. Takes you all over the city. There is lots of lines so you can transfer easily. Just an awesome way to get around Taipei. Ooh another really important one we met lots of friendly locals. Like seriously any time we looked a little lost or disoriented people actually approached us and asked us oh where do you need to go. Do you need any help and that is very rare. I find that in big cities people are always in a rush or like they're focussed on themselves and they don't really stop to help tourists. But in Taipei (臺北市) we had a lot of people helping us out and we also had random people approach us just to practice English and have a little chat. Yeah and it wasn't creepy or anything like that. They were just like really nice pleasant people. So that was cool. Yeah, I felt welcome. Yeah, that was definitely a highlight of visiting Taipei (臺北市. Okay and the last point that we really liked about Taipei is that yes it is a really big city but it is spread out enough that it doesn't feel as claustrophobic. It doesn't feel as crowded as like a Hong Kong or Seoul or some of these other cities. So it has that it just has a feeling like you have a bit more open space. Yeah. And I love that. Personal space is nice. So now we're going to talk about things we didn't necessarily like about Taipei (臺北市). And honestly we had to sit down and like kind of wrack our brains because there weren't a whole lot of things we disliked. No, it was a really fun trip overall. Yeah. Like we really loved visiting. So the thing we'll start off with is whether we were supposed to be visiting what was considered in the dry season. Dry season. And we experienced a lot of rain. And even when it wasn't raining it was really humid. So we kind of had to bring an umbrella everywhere and there would be days where it would be like rain and then a little pocket of sunshine and then a lot of rain again and so like we had to be prepared for rain all the time. Yeah. And you may have seen some blue skies in the video. I think we had one day of blue skies and we were literally oh my gosh it is a sunny day we have to film now. Yeah and we were like running around trying to film in good weather because honestly it was quite wet while we were there. So another thing we kind of disliked about the city and this is true of most big cities we visit is around rush hour in the metro it can get quite crowded. Oh yeah. But yeah aside from that man no complaints. We had a really good time. So if you're thinking of visiting Taipei (臺北市) as well we hope this video was kind of handy. Kind of useful. If you have any other questions about the city feel free to pop those in the comments section below and we'll try to answer those if we can. Yep. If not if you guys know the answer feel free to you know chime in and help fellow travellers out. Yeah, please share your tips because we've only been there for a week so anyone who lives there would know a lot more than we do. So yeah signing off and definitely recommend going to Taipei (臺北市).

I know this sounds a little bit unusual but it is actually really tasty so we've come to a popular place. It is called La Grimanesa, we've already placed our order. Let's go get our cow heart. So this place that we're visiting it actually started as a little street stand, so the women who opened the restaurant used to have a little cart and she used to sell her anticuchos on the street and she had a super long line because her food was delicious. She was really popular. And eventually she was able to save up enough money to open a little restaurant here in the neighborhood. So yeah, humble beginnings, but you know the recipe was great so here we are today. So we have it. The star of the meal. This is my anticuchos. It doesn't really look like a cow's heart in my opinion. I mean, you could food me and tell me this is steak but I'm going to have my first bite. I'm not sure how to do this. Honestly, it's a fairly tender meat. It doesn't have a lot of fat. It could pass off as steak. If no one told you this is a cow's heart you would never know. Your turn. Time for my first bite. I'm going to try some of the sauces here. I think we have a red spicy one and a green one. Oh, that is so so good. And that is really spicy sauce. You know the meat is really well seasoned so it takes on the flavor of whatever they've used. Like the heart it doesn't taste like an organ. I know exactly, normally when I have organs they're really tough and chewy but this is as nice of a tender cut of meat as you can find. And we got one more side to go along with the anticucho. What are you having? This is called choclo. And it is a kind of giant corn which is unique to Peru. Yeah, let's see if we can get a good shot of those kernels because they're bigger than my nails. I know they're massive. They're huge. And the taste is great. It is quite sweet. Yeah, but is also kind of fibrous too. It's very chewy. And price point for anybody who is willing to try cow's heart? For the cow's heart, all the side dishes and a drink it came to 33 Soles which is just over 10 US dollars. Not bad value. We're full. #eatPERU So for today's meal we are going for more of an upscale dining experience. We are having lunch at a place called La Rosa Náutica, which means the nautical rose. And it is a really cool restaurant out on the water. There is this pier built over the ocean and it just leads you all the way to this little restaurant. So you're like surrounded by waves, there is surfers, birds. Perfect setting and the food here is really good. I've been here once before many many years ago. So I'm excited to come back with more mature taste buds. So our food has arrived and we went all out. We got a little bit of everything. So I'm having the starter tasting menu over here which comes with three different types of ceviche which I love. And Sam is having the grand tasting menu and his appetizers have also arrived and they are looking pretty fancy. Okay, so first up this one is espagon and this one is flounder. Made with flounder. Is it a ceviche? It is a cebiche. Yes. Let's just dip it in the sauce. Mmmmmm. Oh wow. It is some of the best ceviche I've ever had. The fish just, it is so so tender and the sauce it has a really strong kick of lime. Like there is nothing subtle about it. Mmmmm. It's good. Moving on to the next. Have a look here. This one is called colorado and it has also flounder, shrimp and a little bit of squid. And it also has the yellow corn. The choclo. The choclo. Let's grab some choclo. I'm expecting this to be spicy. It already has a lot of sauce so I won't be adding anymore. Mmmmm. Oh yeah. Mmmm. I always expect squid to be a little bit chewy but this is great. Made to perfection. So yeah, I'm really enjoying this so far. And we've got one more - the last one. This one has flounder, octopus and a cilantro sauce and it has the canchita that we tend to find in lots of places. We love that. That makes an appearance at most tables. Salty corn. Mmmmm. It is a nice mix of soft and crunchy. And the sauce is refreshing. Really nice ceviche. Alright, Sam so let's have a look at your plate. Oh, exciting times. So I've got a three portion appetizer sampler as well. What are you starting with? And we're going to start out with the causa. The yellow mashed potatoes and this comes with a tuna tartar in a smoked chili peppers and avocado. I love tuna tartar. So I'm going to be trying some of that later. Wow. I bet it is magic. Magic in the mouth. Like those are three really amazing things all at once. Love causa, the potatoes, then you add that nicely sliced avocado and then the tartar. Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. Okay let's move on. Moving on, this is the classic ceviche. Yeah. So, yeah this is what we love to eat here in Peru. And especially Lima. The one meal that we've probably had more than any other is cebiche. I feel like we have it every other day. When we're in Peru it's just ceviche, cebiche, more ceviche. That's the most tender ceviche I've ever had. Yeah, isn't it? I don't know what they do to make it this tender but it is just amazing. You don't even really have to chew it. Yeah, it has got a special touch. And then the sauce is just - oh wow. And then moving on to the last one here, this is the octopus salad. And it also comes with toasted yucca which is a pretty unique thing to do. It is kind of like a root. Yeah, it is kind of like a root similar to a potato and it also comes with olive sauce. Oh, reading the menu over there. Sorry. Kind of cheating a bit. Kind of cheating a little bit here. So the next course has arrived. And now I'm going to be sampling three different types of causa. So causa is a type of dish that is made with yellow mashed potato and it is usually served kind of like a shepherd's pie but this is a bit fancier. So we have a nice little swirls of yellow potato. And I'm having three different types. The one you see over here with the shrimp is called Arequipeña. It has a nice ocopa, creamy sauce. Then if we move over to the middle this one is made with poleveto so it is octopus and olive sauce and at the very end you have one with tuna in a chili pepper cream. Wow. So which one do you start with? Let's start with tuna. I tried Sam's tuna. You seem to be a big fan of tuna. Yeah. Oh wow, it looks like the tartar too. Magic. Look at that. Getting it. Mmmm. Oh yeah. Oh man. There may not be any left over for you. This fish just melts in your mouth. It is so good. Mmmmm. Okay shall we move on to the next one? Yes. So this is our octopus here. Let's see. You know I've become a pretty big fan of octopus ever since we've been in Lima. They really know how to prepare it well. You didn't like it so much in Korea. No but here totally different story. So yeah that is good. And you really taste the olive oil. They've used it so smooth like it leaves a nice little aftertaste. And this, last but not least, how shall I do this? Just bite it off? Yeah. Just dunk it in and bite it off. Okay. Let's get the shrimp. Mmmmm. Wow. That's fresh. It tastes like the ocean. So which of the three did you like the most? The tuna? Probably tuna. I just loved tuna. I can't get enough of it. Mmmmm. So what is next on the menu? And the last of your sampler portion has arrived. These are the Carpaccio. Let's just take a look down at those. So over here we have got salmon with green onions, vinaigrette with a quail egg. Yeah, that is pretty fancy. I would say. Over here tuna in a mustard sauce with also soy sauce and sesame seeds. You can see the sesame seeds there. And finally we've got flounder with basil oil and black salt. Oh oh. So Salmon is pretty much my favorite fish so I think I'm going to try that one last. So we will start off with the flounder. Sam always leaves the best for last. Yeah, that is my way of doing things when I eat. Mmmmm. It is good. That's sour. And it tastes actually quite similar to a ceviche. Yeah. It is the same fish they use for a cebiche. Well, there you go. That answers the question. There you go. Okay on to the tuna. And what I want to make sure is that I get lots of this sesame sauce and sesame seeds. What you want to make sure is that you leave some for me. Oh. That's the best thing I've tried here so far. Like this the combination of that amazing tuna and then you have this tangy sesame sauce which is really rich and creamy. Oh yeah. Oh yeah he says. Alright, now your favorite. Last but not least let's move on to the salmon. I grew up eating a lot of salmon on Vancouver Island, where I'm from in Canada, so this will be familiar and tasty. Oh, woah. That is fresh. That is tender and that is just very high quality salmon. I love this. So the food just keeps on coming. This is Sam's main, and again it is a sampler with three different dishes. So have a look down here. First up we're having Lomo Saltado, which is one of the national dishes I guess you could say. Um so it is kind of like a fried beef with onions, tomato and there is yellow potato french fries underneath. And then we are moving over to the shrimp with tacu tacu. Now that is a big shrimp. It is massive. More like a prawn. And the tacu tacu is basically rice and fried beans. And last but not least we've got the catch of the day, a pan-fried white fish with some potatoes in a creamy sauce. So yeah, lots of food. So you're going with the lomo saltado first. The lomo saltado. So we've got a little piece of meat, maybe let's grab a potato. Oh my gosh. I spilled. I spilled. Don't let them see. I couldn't get the potato. Let's just go for the beef. Mmmmm. Wow. You know what? That sauce it almost has a bit of a Chinese influence. It is really interesting. I don't think I've ever tried lomo saltado in Peru before. This may be my first. And my yellow potato fry. Mmmmm. Good stuff. Now let's clean up my mess before they come. There we go. All clear. Okay, moving on. I'm just going to cut off a piece so you get some as well. Please, that is the one I'm looking forward to the most. A bit of shrimp, rice and beans. Woah. That looks amazing. Mmmmm. It is nice. It almost tastes a little bit Mexican - the refried beans and rice. It is good. Good combo. And I'm going to move on to the fish. She's excited about the fish. I sure am. Let's get a bit of sauce. I'm not sure what this sauce is. What does it say on the menu? A leek sauce. That is what it is. Leek. There we go. Mmmmmm. That is so creamy and smooth. That is good. I think we're going to remember this meal, huh? Forever and ever. Forever and ever. So I'm getting pretty sad over here because it is almost time to wrap up this meal. I know. We're already full but dessert has arrived and we will be making room for it because everything at this restaurant has just been incredible so far. So let's have a look at dessert. So take a look down here and you're going to see first that this is a chocolate crunchy mouse. Okay. And over here we pomme de raison which is kind of like a crispy pancake with vanilla, manjar and strawberries. So vanilla sauce. And this is the one I'm most interested in trying. This is a chocolate tart with lúcuma mousse. And that is like one of my favorite local fruits here in Peru. So we've got a nice spread of desserts. It is time to dig in. Dig in. Which one is first. Alright, I'm going to try. Let's go over here first. And we will try the crunchy chocolate mousse with berries. I wonder if that is coconut on top? Oh, I can definitely feel the crunch at the bottom here. Let's try that. Mmmmm. Wow. That mousse is really light and it is really rich. And I have no idea what that crunchy thing, the crunchiness at the bottom is. But it is tasty. It tastes a bit like granulated sugar but I know it is not that. Okay, time to try that pancake and I don't have a knife anymore. Oh, it is crunchy. So that broke off nicely. Oh, you can hear happy birthday in the background. Someone is having a birthday. This is a great place for a birthday. Yeah, I can of feel like this is should be both of our birthdays. Hahaha. In advance. Mmmmmm. Okay. That is really crunchy when you first bite into it but then it is light and it disintegrates in your mouth. And the manjar sauce, the vanilla sauce, is just very light and the strawberries kind of just add a nice juicy kick at the end. Ooh. And now on to the one you're most looking forward to. So as you know by now I save my favorite one for the end. And look at all of the manjar. Oh, that is lucuma. Sorry sorry what am I say. Lucuma. Lucuma filling but with maybe on the plate. Lucuma. Oh. Oh oh oh. That's the best. That's the best. Oh yeah. That filling is almost like, it is a combination of tasting like the actual fruit, and it also tastes like a creamy butterscotch pudding as well. Oh, that is good. Well, hello captain. Time to resume my captain duties over here. Hahaha. So was that one of the best meals you've ever had or what? Yeah, that ranks up there really really highly. I mean it is certainly the fanciest meal we've ever had in Lima or in Peru for that matter. And you know the price reflected that. The price of what I ordered which included the appetizers, the mains and the desserts was a hundred and sixty Soles and your appetizer portion which had three different things. It has the causa, the ceviches and the other part that was 80 Soles. So in total it was a 250 Sole meal. That is quite a bit. You're looking at you know 70-80 US dollars but it was so worth it. It is a dining experience we'll never forget. #eatPERU So for today's lunch we are eating at a place that has been recommended by my Aunt. This is called La Picantería and basically you come here, you order a whole fish and you have it prepared four different ways. So apparently we're going to be getting soups, ceviche, some grilled fish skin and a few other things so that should be pretty exciting. I'm really looking forward to eating this. And the cool thing is that they are letting us take a little sneak peak behind the kitchen so let's go have a tour right now. So the first part of our fish has arrived. If you take a look down here you'll see that half of it was prepared as a ceviche. So this is ceviche with rocoto which is like a hot red pepper, a little bit of seaweed on here, we have our sweet potato, some red onions and aside from the ceviche this is called Chicharrón. And they basically took the skin of the fish and put it in a batter and fried it. So I'm going to eat some fish skin right now. And that looks good. Oh wow. Mmmmmm. Never had fish skin like this before. This is amazing. This is so good. Wow. Honestly, I thought it was going to be kind of gross eating fish skin but it is almost like eating fried chicken skin. I don't know if that is weird for you but I like it. And now it is time for Sam to try the ceviche. Yes, you got to try the chicharron so that means I get for first dibs of the ceviche. And look at the colors. This looks amazing. The colors look amazing. There is like generous amount of onions and you can tell that there is the tiger's milk here at the bottom. Mmmmm. We've now had cebiche in several countries and nothing beats Peruvian ceviche. This is just the best. I love Peruvian cebiche. So sour, you've got like the tender taste of the fish and then the onions as a compliment. It is just delicious. Amaze-balls. I can't wait to dig in. That looks fabulous. And before we even finished our ceviche and chicharrón check out this. Our second dish has arrived. More food. Okay so this one is called Jalea Norteña. And if you have a look here it is basically like these really thin strips of fish and it has a yellow aji sauce. Kind of like a yellow pepper. We have some chives here, a bit of olive oil. That sauce looks amazing. It looks great. Let me try this. Oh la lah. Are you getting this? Mmmmmm. Wow. It is really nice. Like the sauce they've used, kind of like a chili in an olive oil mixed together, see if you can get a shot of that. And it is really nice. I've never had raw fish with olive oil before. But I am a fan. Mmmmmm. Let's get a close-up of that. Wow. And then on the other side of this pan we have more of the chicharron more fried fish skin, as well as a little bit of corn maize. Is that the canchita? Yeah, just prepared a different way. I'm really enjoying this experience so far. This is pretty cool. Like they are not going to waste any part of this fish because I think next up we're getting a soup. So yeah, we should probably start eating a little faster. You're going to be stuffed by the end of this meal. And what are you doing now? And I can't let any of that leche de tigre, the tiger's milk, go to waste. Oh, so sour, so spicy. I think this is the most sour tiger's milk I've ever had while ever having ceviche. And there is still more left. Keep working at it. None of that will go to waste friends. So let's just take a minute here to talk about this spicy canchita. How good is it? Yes, we love the spicy canchita. It is basically the fried corn that is heavily salted. But what makes this one unique at this particular restaurant is that I don't know if you can see this but I'm going to try and pull it out. But if you look at my hand here. It has got chili. Yes, it has got chilies. This is the spiciest canchita we've ever had. Like we were snacking on this before we got our beverages and we're like. Urgh. Parched. We need our water. But it is so good. So yet another dish has arrived. This one is called Calianotena. If you take a look down here it is a fish that has been marinated in this sauce. I'm not sure what it is made of but it has a beautiful color. And under the fish you're going to find sweet potato and they also have yucca which is kind of like this fibrous root that we don't really have in North America but it is delicious. That is very Peruvian. It is. And on top we have some red onions and it looks wonderful. So let's just dig in to this. Look at that. It is still steaming. This is still piping hot. I don't want to burn myself again on camera. Mmmmm. That is nice. It is almost like a sweet glaze. I really like that. If you take a look here you can see it still has the fish skin on it. And it is a little bit crispy. So yeah, it is a really nice combination. The fish is super super tender, it just melts in your mouth. So let's try and get a bit of everything for this next bite. Look at that. Even yucca and kamote. Sweet potato and fish. Mmmmm. That is real good. So the food just keeps on coming. You better believe it. This is dish number four. And if you take a look down here you'll see that we've got grilled fish and it has the aji sauce and the sliced spring onions. And it appears to be massive yucca wedges. They are not even fries they are more like wedges. So time to try that. I'm going to take a little bit of the yucca wedge. And I'm going to take a bit of the fish here. Oh yeah. It is just amazing. Out of all of the fish we've tried I'd say that is the most tender. And then you have the spiciness of the aji sauce. And then the yucca chip as a complimentary ingredient as well. This is just an amazing meal. And I don't even think we're done yet. Yeah, and let me just point out that this place has filled up so quickly. There is no space left in the whole restaurant. Everyone is eating here. That is when you know it is good. More food. And now for the grand finale we have a fish soup which looks pretty good. Let's take a look over here. We've got the fishes head and I guess some bones. We've got the tail. So yeah, let's have some fish soup. That's another first. Let's pour it in. Dish it up. Dishing it up. Would you like the fish eyeball Sam? Oh yes, specialize reservation for me with that one. Or the tail? Which one do you think is tastier? Let's see if I can fish it out. I'm trying here. I'm really trying. Wow. That is huge. It is still attached. Never mind. It is your lucky day Sam. You just get soup. No tail. So I do believe this is the final dish now. The soup. Wow. How does it taste Sam? It is sour, a bit salty and yeah you can taste that fish as well too. It is the key ingredient. Oh and spicy too. Spicy. Spicy soup. So in terms of price point that was a 160 Soles. And as of today that is exactly 50 US dollars. So it was 25 dollars per person. So it is not the cheapest meal but I would still say it is really good value considering how much food we got. Like I am beyond stuffed. It is time to go home and just pass out on the couch. Yeah, and we should also mention this is a very trendy place at the moment. #eatPERU So it is time for another food video and today we are going to be trying something that is called Causa. Causa, it is kind of like a shepperds pie if you haven't tried it before, it is made with yellow mashed potato and you can get lots of different fillings. So we've ordered two different varities and that should be coming soon and it is going to be delicious. I love the causa. And while we wait. While we wait, while we wait. We're going to have our favorite snack - Canchita - which is the fried corn with salt on top of it. Ah, I'm loving this stuff. And I'm always amazed by the size of these kernels. Seriously, it never gets old. Look at that. I know. They are gigantic. Massive. They're like twice the size of what we're used to having back home in Canada. So the causa has arrived and it is a thing of beauty. How excited are you for your food, Sam? Yeah, it looks like artwork. I almost feel guilty tucking in to it. Almost. Okay, so let's talk about the key ingredients that make up causa. So you have your yellow potato, lime and aji which is the yellow hot pepper. Yeah. In terms of fillings you can have lots of different ones. So Sam went with the classic. Mine has chicken and you can also see that there is some avocado here on the side as well. And that looks like some mayo sauce on top. I'm just going to dig right in. I'm going right to the bottom. It is like cutting into a tower. Wow. That is really good. Yeah? Yeah. And with this particular causa it is really salty. You can tell they've added a lot of salt to it. But it just like, when you get that much yellow potatoes, it is just oh man it is so good. It is almost like having Mom's mashed potatoes back home or something but with much better dressings. With the chicken and the sauce and the avocado. Oh man, that is good. Okay and let's talk about the chicken. Is it shredded chicken? Like the one we had in Aji de Gallina or is it chopped. It is shredded chicken. Yeah. Okay. One more bite for quality control. Research purposes. That is good stuff. And I am beyond excited for mine because I saw Causa Acevichado on the menu and that is a ceviche causa. Look at that. So I've got my fish, a little bit of fish that has been cooked in lime. I have my red onions, I have my hot chili peppers and of course my yellow mashed potato with a bit of mayo. Super fancy over there. I know. And if you know how much I love ceviche this is just the perfect dish for me really. You're doing a good job of toppling it already. I don't know why but I'm blowing on my food. That is such a habit. It is cold. It is a cold dish. Mmmmm. Oh, yeah. The best of both worlds? It is so good. The lime. So much lime. And it is so tangy. And a little spicy. With those little pieces of red chili. Mmmmm. This is my favorite. I haven't even tried yours but I know this is my favorite. So it would appear Sam has food envy. So I'm reaching across the table to grab some of Audrey's. Yeah, mine looks so good you couldn't resist. I do like mine but I can't leave this restaurant without at least trying the one with ceviche too. Well, what do you think? Wow. I've never had causa with ceviche so this is a really unique experience for me. I love it. I mean I think I prefer. I do prefer yours to mine. Yeah. And another thing I love about this dish, about causa, is all of the colors. Like look at that. The bright yellows, the purple from the onion, the red. We've got lots of greens. It is just such a colorful meal. It is an attractive meal. It is art on a plate. Art on a plate. There you go. Okay, so it is now time for price point. So in terms of price point that cam to 45 Soles which is $13 US dollars. Not bad value. We're both leaving really full. And what is kind of funny is that this is typically served as an appetizer not as a main. But if you eat it one per person it can totally be a main. It is so filling. It is potatoes. It is heavy. It is very carb intensive so if you're in Lima or Peru definitely check out causa. It is something we highly recommend. So last night's attempt to eat Cuy or Guinea Pig was a bit of a flop so we tried again tonight. We finally found a restaurant that is open and serving Guinea Pig, so yeah we've placed our order and we're sitting here just waiting for our first Cuy meal. This is a first for both me and Sam. Okay, so time to spew off a few facts about Guinea Pig. Yeah, so the Cuy is something we've been wanting to try for a while now. It is one of the most traditional Peruvian foods you can possibly get. It originates from the Andes. It is a rodent. And apparently the meat is very high in protein and low in cholesterol. So it is healthy for you! Yeah, exactly. Who would have known. This is a perfect meal to have just before our hike to Machu Picchu. Yeah. So another fun fact, because I know you guys really like those is that if you visit Cuszo Cathedral, once you go inside you'll see that there is a painting of Jesus and the 12 Disciples enjoying their last supper and guess what they're eating? It's a Guinea Pig and it is lying on its back with its little paws up in the air. So if Guinea Pig is good enough for Jesus and his Disciples we can certainly eat it while we're in Cusco. And they were kind enough to let us go take a look at how it is being cooked and prepared. So let's go walk over and check out the wood fire burning oven. Just over there. Just over there. That is where our Cuy is being made. So our dinner has arrived and I'm trying not to look at the Guinea Pig in the face because it kind of reminds me of my sister's two pet Chinchillas but there it is on the plate. And it comes with a few sides so if you look down here you can see that we have some golden potatoes, some fried yellow potato actually and we have a little salad and we also have a stuffed pepper with cheese melted over top. So yes, I guess the next step is to dig in to our Cuy. So our server has kindly chopped up the Cuy because we didn't really know where to begin and apparently you have to eat this with your hands. Yes, so I'm going to grab just a chunk here. It is time for the first bite. Is that like the back? Oh, the skin. Wow, the meat is quite tender. You know what it tastes a lot like chicken. If I didn't know what I was eating I would have guessed it was chicken. That's good to know. It makes me a feel a little better about taking my first bite. I think I have the back and the hind leg. I'm just taking little nibbles. How does it taste? It's like stringy chicken. Yeah, like it even looks like chicken. Like the dark meat on a chicken. So you could fool me but I've seen the whole Guinea Pig on the plate. So now I know what I'm having and you just kind of have to get over that because it does make a bit of an impression on you. Especially if you have Chinchillas for pets because they just look so similar. So moving on we're kind of taking a bite of its mid-section here. So what you really notice about when you have Guinea Pig is that the skin is really crispy but the meat inside is quite tender. I actually like it. We're also noticing that there are some organs and bones. Yeah, yeah and strange things inside our Cuy. It is very much cooked as it is and you eat it as it is presented. Yes, that is how you have Cuy in Peru. Except you are using cutlery instead of your hands. You have it all wrong. Oh, right. That's right. So now the verdict. If you saw Cuy on a menu would you order it again? I'm not necessarily sure I would just because it is a bit expensive and I think that if you were to have something like chicken or something else you might get a little bit more meat. But I'm really glad I tried it. It tasted honestly better than I expected and uh yeah if you're Peru definitely try it though at a least once. And your final verdict? Well, it didn't taste bad but that being said I'm not sure I would eat it again. I just don't like seeing the whole animal on my plate. And I know that is kind of silly to say because I do eat meat. I do eat fish. So it doesn't make sense to just eliminate Guinea Pig but yeah not for me. Not for me. #eatPERU So today's video is going to be a bit of loud one. We are sitting at a restaurant here in Iquitos called Ari's and it is right across from Plaza de Armas and there is a lot of tuk tuk traffic rushing by but we're going to be waiting for a dish. We're having something called Juane and it takes 45 minutes to prepare. Now this is a very special dish and it is meant to resemble the head of John the Baptist on a platter. So I think it is certainly worth waiting for here in the heat. But in the meantime we'll be trying some fresh juices as well as some starters. So I don't know if you can see but Sam is sweating big time over here. It is a little bit gross. Like honestly. Yeah. So we had to get you a refreshing drink. Yeah, we're trying to take care of that by getting something called Cremolada. And that is a little bit like kind of a fruit slushy. A fruit smoothie. Yeah. And we're trying a really regional fruit. It is called Camu Camu. And it is cool because when we were cruising down the Amazon we got to visit some land and some villages that had the camu camu plant and it is kind of shaped really small. It is sort of like a small little ball. I heard our guide kind of refer to it as it looks a bit like the yellow tomato. And it is really sour. Super sour. Super sour. So we'll see if this in cremolada form lives up to its actual fruit. Well, what do you think? It is sour but it is more sweet. It is very sugary. Lots of sugar has been added. Yes. That is the most dominant ingredient in here. Super concentrated in the camu camu then. It is a little bit syrupy. So we've ordered a few starters until the Juane gets here. And I am having Patacones. So if you take a look down here it is basically the plantain and it has been kind of smashed down flat and then fried and it comes with a sauce here. This looks like the huancaina sauce. This is piping hot, man. Mmmm. How is that? That is nice. It is a little salty. Owe! It is like a savory plantain but it is so so hot. And if you take a look at the sauce over here I'm just going to add some of this. Apparently this is aji. I've never seen it looking green before but it should be good. A bit of spice. Mmmmm. So that is where the savory salty snack isn't it? That is spicy. I'm just burning up here. I don't know if it is the heat or the spice or what but I'm like on fire. And what did you get? And I'm having Maduros Fritos. Take a look down here. And that is like the slices of plantain, and unlike yours which is a savory plantain, this is super sweet. Yeah, so it gets its name Madura because it is super ripe. Oh man, this is so good. I love how, yeah exactly, how ripe these are and how sweet they are. If I just had a little bit of Rum sauce to pour on that would make the best dessert ever. Seriously. Keiko. Cheering. Honking. Keiko. Keiko. So one of the reasons it is so loud outside is that there was a rally just happened. The Presidential elections are coming up in a little while and there was some Keiko supporters out there. PPK Cheering. Honking. And there goes the other political party the PPK. So our Juane has at long last arrived. If you have a look over here you can see that it comes wrapped in a leaf. So basically this is a dish that is eaten for the feast of John the Baptist and that is a feast that is celebrated on June 24th but you can find this dish in restaurants pretty much everyday of the year. Like it is a really popular dish. Yeah, it is really typical of the region isn't it? Yeah. It sure is. I think you can see why it took so long to prepare. Look at the detail here. Yeah, so inside it is rice, chicken, a boiled egg and black olives. That is a huge portion. Like seriously. That is enough for two people to share. And we've already been eating a lot of food. Yeah. Alright, time to dig in and try that. So looking down here I've got a piece of something. Apparently it is chicken. It does not look like chicken to me. But yeah, it is just the dark part of the chicken. It is the darker meat of the chicken. Mmmmm. That is really good. Savory, salty and you can taste a lot of the different herbs that have been mixed in with the rice. Time for your first bite. Okay. I'm going to go for the egg and the rice. Egg and rice combo coming up. Oh, big bite. Gotta like it. Yeah, wow. Really nice. There is a lot of spices mixed in with the rice so it is actually really quite savory and salty like you were saying. And also another interesting fact about this dish is that it used to be really popular with travelers who were going on long journeys because of the way it is packaged. Basically it travels really well and it can last a longtime. So yeah, I like this. Honestly, it seems like the kind of dish you'd want to eat on a cold day back at home. You know, it is like really hearty and savory but it so frickin' hot here so I'm not sure. I was going to say there is not too many of those days here in Iquitos. But it is nice. I would recommend trying it if you find yourself here. And someone over here simply could not resist dessert. Yeah, we decided we're going to order something and we wanted to try something we've never had before so we got something called Leche Asada. And apparently it is a milk based dessert that has been cooked in the oven and you can see like the top part is caramelized kind of. So let's dig in. Oh, it has the consistency kind of sort of like a rice pudding or maybe a flan. But it is just milk apparently. It is really sweet. And milky. Hahaha. Surprise. And last but not least let's talk about the price of this meal. Yeah, so our feast of feasts is over and that came to 45 Soles. And we ordered way too much food. Like we are bringing the main dish home. At least over half of that. So it was a lot of food. That included the drink, that included the two plantain dishes, the main and the dessert. And that came to 45 Soles which is about 13-14 US dollars. So pretty cheap when you consider how much food we had. And I have to admit this restaurant has massive portions so if you're coming here you're going to want to come as a group and share your dishes. #eatPERU So we have finally made it to the Amazon Jungle and we are starting our trip out in Iquitos. It is lunchtime right now and we are starving from a full day of travel. So we found a little place. It is called, what is the name of this, the Yellow Rose of Texas, which I know does not sound very Peruvian but they specialize in food from the Amazon region. We've ordered some paiche which is a traditional fish from this area and we are going to be having it two different ways so the food will be coming soon. Muchas gracias. Gracias. So Sam over here has been pretty excited about trying paiche ever since my Grandma told him about it. About this fish from the jungle. So what can you tell us about it? Yeah, so I've been researching a little bit online about it. So it is native to the Amazon which is really cool and it is a huge fish. In fact, it is one of the biggest freshwater fish in the world. It can grow up to three meters in length. Gracias. And something else really cool is that it is called a bony tongue fish and its tongue is thought to have medicinal properties by natives so. I wonder what kind of properties. Yeah. So for our beverage we asked the waitress what is a traditional juice we can have and she suggested cocona. Yeah, cocona. Which we've never heard of before. We've never heard of before and we're not even sure there is an English equivalent for this. There probably isn't. Yeah. We're not necessarily the most adventurous travelers but we are adventurous with our taste buds. So we will try this. Always with food. Mmmm. It smells kind of citrus-y. Well? Oh, wow. It is super sweet. It kind of has. It is really strange. It kind of has almost like a milky taste as well. And it has a strong sort of nectar taste. Like it is almost a little bit like a pineapple but something a lot milkier. Yeah. That is interesting. Wow. I do like it though. So now my dish is here and I'm going to be trying something called patarashca de paiche. And if you take a look at my plate it is basically the paiche served as a fillet. It has been cooked, kind of like steamed in this leaf, and on top of the fish you can see some onions, tomatoes and it also has a little bit of cilantro. We've got some lime here which we can try and squeeze. Squeeze that on. That is a little messy. I got most of it on my fingers like lotion. And then I also have this spicy aji sauce. So you know how we ordered a juice of cocona. This is the fruit it is made with. And they've also used it to make a spicy aji. So this is like a spicy sauce but then it also has the same fruit in it. Um, so yeah, let's just load it up. Dig right in. Oh yeah, just load it up on there. I like my spice. Load that spicy up. So let's see. Let's try a bite. I wonder if it has bones? Or is this a boneless fish? I forget. It probably does have bones. Big bite here. Mmmm. How is that? That is really good. You know, we were saying the paiche was a little bit chewy with the chicharron. The fried one. But it is so soft if you have it steamed. Like it just breaks apart with your fork. And I really like that you can taste the cilantro because that is one of my favorite spices ever. Or herbs rather. Going in for a second bite. That is how we know it is good. That is wonderful. Loving it. So the paiche chicharron. So I've just got myself a piece here. And as you can see it is breaded and it is just time to try that. Breaded and fried. Mmmm. Wow. Really really crispy on the outside and it is strange. It almost tastes a little bit more like chicken than it does typical fish. Yeah. It is a bit of a chewier fish wouldn't you say? It is. It really is. It's something in between the texture of a fish and a piece of chicken. It's really unique. I guess it is quite a large fish so the meat is probably a bit tougher for that reason. And it came with some red onions. Yeah. Which I love. But over there in the back we have maduros fritos. And maduros fritos are basically like plantain. Like sweet ripe plantain that has been sliced and fried. I can't wait to try this. Oh. Wow! Wow! That is amazing. Really really sweet and it is not crispy at all. It is fried just so that you kind of think it brings out more of the sweetness of the plantain. It is almost a little bit caramelized. It is. I mean this almost feels like I'm having like a little bit of dessert with my fish. We almost forgot the Yucca fries. Yeah, so this came with the Chicharrón. We were able to order a side. And yucca, it is kind of like a root. A very fibrous root almost like a potato and it is yellow and it is cooked fried here. It is really good. They are like almost like wedges. They are super thick fries. Bigger than our fingers. It goes really well with the paiche for sure. So this is what we call the sign of a satisfying meal. Empty plates. We sure took care of that. This was my first time trying food from the Amazon. Food from the Peruvian jungle. I have loved this meal. It has been amazing and I can't wait to see what we have next for dinner and lunch tomorrow and then dinner. And then the following day. It is going to be great. Loving it. #eatPERU For today's food video we are going to be eating nothing but desserts. We're at a little place in Lima that is called La Tiendecita Blanca and we're pretty sure this is actually a little Swiss cafe not Peruvian. But they do have some Peruvian dishes here. So we've ordered Suspiro a la limeña and Merengado de chirimoya and the last one is Torta Tres leches which I'm pretty sure was not invented in Peru but you can find it almost everywhere. So we're going to be sampling those three today. It is going to be sugary. We're going to start out with the most authentic of all the three desserts. This one is called Suspiro a la limeña and that means the sigh of the women from Lima. What a name for a dessert. Wow! Seriously. I don't think I've ever heard of a dessert that has quite a name like that. So this thing of beauty originated in the city of Lima in the 19th century. It is a very popular dessert. Yeah. And that looks good. And apparently it has manjar blanco which is kind of like the dulce de leche of Peru. And it also comes with egg yolks. It is not egg whites. And what is the other one? It has vanilla essence. Vanilla essence. My gosh, I can remember two out of three today it seems. Let's try that. Mmmm. Oh, that looks so thick. It looks so thick like a thick pudding. And I've never had this before so this is exciting. Oh, wow. That's like the best butterscotch pudding I've ever had in my whole life. That is amazing. Wow, you really taste the manjar blanco. It has a rich kind of caramel milky kind of consistency. And it is really thick and creamy but also extremely sweet. Like this is just woah. Jolted by the sugar. Is it a hot or a cold dessert because I haven't had any yet. It is actually luke warm. Luke warm. It is actually lukewarm. It is not hot or cold. Room temperature? Yeah, it is served at room temperature. And if you see this lovely little swirl on top that is some meringue and it looks a little bit purple because it is made with port wine. It has a tiny hint of port wine and then cinnamon on top. This is a decadent dessert. You definitely will want to try if you're visiting Lima. Yeah, one more bite then. One more bite. Just to prove. To prove that you really did enjoy it. Wow. Number two, we are having something called Merengado de chirimoya. Oh la lah. And don't be fooled by this little fruit on the side. This is not chirimoya. Chirimoya is actually a big green fruit. It almost looks like a giant avocado and inside it has some white flesh. So yeah, that is in here and it has been mixed with manjar blanco which is similar to dulce de leche. Um, let's see if I can find some of it. Oh, wow that looks really thick and decadent. So yeah it is like fruit and manjar blanco served chilled with meringue on top. Mmmmm. Yeah, it is a nice combination. The fruit itself. Is it refreshing. It is refreshing because it has been served chilled but the fruit itself Chirimoya it doesn't have that strong of a flavor. So what I mostly taste is the manjar blanco and there is a hint of a tiny fruit in the back. So yeah, it is nice. I wish I could find a good chunk of fruit but it is like white. White and fleshy. It is kind of hard to see but it is in there. So apparently Mark Twain once tried Chirimoya and he said it was the most delicious fruit known to man. So that is high praise for Chirimoya. And I think in English it is actually known as a custard apple but I mean I've never used that expression before. It just sounds wrong. It does. What is a custard apple. So I don't know but the dessert is good. I can recommend it. Oh, and did we mention that it has meringue on top? And the meringue it also looks a little bit purple because they've added some port wine. So that is nice. Let's just break that apart. Look at that. Oh la lah. I know it looks messy but it is good. And last but not least, we are having the non Peruvian dessert which is really popular in Peru. Yeah, the Tres Leches one. And that means three different kinds of milk. So we've got the evaporated, we've got the cream and what is the other one? Condensed. I almost forgot. A lot of milks to remember. Yeah, it is. Let's dig right in. Time to dig in. And I can tell at the bottom it is already really soggy so I think those tres leches are seeping down right to the bottom. Wow. Yeah. You really taste the different milks. Like that is the overwhelming thing. It is kind of different from a normal cake which is dry. This is kind of a wet cake and you yeah you really taste the milk. It is very sugary too. I have to say I definitely like it. And if you take a closer look you can actually see it is a sponge cake. So there is a pretty good job of soaking those three milks. And on top we have some cream, some whipped cream, strawberries. And this right here is called aguaymanto. Having trouble focusing. But there it is. So apparently there is no equivalent in English. I guess this is very Peruvian. I'll try it. In it goes. Sweet or sour that is the question? Very sour. Very sour. Maybe a little too sour for my liking. So the question is are you on a sugar high or do you need a siesta? I'm on a sugar high. I should be like surfing on a pile of sugar. Forget the water, forget the waves. Whipped cream waves. Whipped cream waves. There you go. Anyways, let's talk about the price for those three desserts. So it was 48 Pesos which is just under $15 US. Pesos? What country are we in? Oh gosh, Sam. 48 Soles. You know what we've been in countries with Pesos often so my gosh. I wake up and I don't know where I am. Okay, so 48 Soles. 48 Soles which is just under $15 US dollars. Not bad value. I mean you can get these desserts where it is cheaper but this is a little bit more of a fancier restaurant and the quality here is excellent. The food is really good. #eatPERU So it is time to continue sampling some traditional dishes from the Amazon region. We found a random little restaurant just by chance and it is lunchtime so we've popped in and we've ordered a few different items and all of these dishes are going to be featuring either plantains or cecina which is a dried dehydrated pork meat. So it should be tasty. And we're having the same juice that we had yesterday. The cocona. And I like to refer to this as the lemonade of the jungle. It is sweet and refreshing. So the food is here and first up we're going to be showing you Tacacho con Cecina. So take a look down at the plate. This right here is Tacacho and it is basically plantain. They fry it, then they mash it up together and they kind of turn it into this big ball. And that is being served with a side of cecina which is the pork meat. The dehydrated pork meat. And judging by the color I would guess it has been marinated or I don't know soaked in some kind of sauce. So I'm going to try the two of them together. A bit of both. Yeah, so for this meal they came separately but you can also find Tacacho that already has the pieces of pork inside of it. Mmmmm. Wow. That is really really good. You get the sweetness of the plantain but also the saltiness of the dehydrated meat. That is really really tasty. So Sam, it is now your turn. Tell us what you're having. Yes, so I'm having the Cecina chaufa. So basically take a look down here and you can see that I have strips of the pork as well but it is in a mixed rice form. Like a Chinese style rice. And mine has eggs, it has chives, it has over here it has plantains on the side. So I'm going to take a bite of that and also grab some of the cecina and let's see how that tastes. Mmmmm. Wow! That almost reminds me a little bit of bacon. Bacon eh? Yeah. It reminds me a little bit of bacon. That is really good. And the rice is delicious too. You know what is awesome is that portions at this restaurant are huge. Yeah. And you know what is kind of cool. I feel like with this meal they are combining the local cuisine from Iquitos, the jungle food with Chifa which is the Chinese influence. The fried rice. There you go. Yeah. Awesome fusion food. So I'm not sure if this is the way you eat it but they brought us the Aji made with cocona. So it has the fruit but it is like a spicy sauce. So I'm going to put it on my plantain. I don't know if this is how the locals do it but since I like my spice that is how I am going to do it. Let's grab a bite. Big bite. A nice enhancement? Nice and spicy. Mmmm. It has a bit of vinegar and lime juice. It is really nice. And it also came with a salad. I've got some avocado, it looks nice and ripe. So yeah, I am loving this meal. Like the food here in Iquitos is really cool because it is so fresh and they use a lot of vegetables and fruits. Delicious! Very good! Very good! Yeah, and I felt like that is something that was almost lacking in Lima. We were starting to miss our fruits and veggies. So it is good to be here. So that was ridiculously amazing value for what we ate. I know that feast of feasts only cost thirty one Soles and that includes everything. That massive jar of juice plus our two mains. So I mean you're talking less than ten US dollars. Pretty darn good value if you ask me. #eatPERU First question of the day - how many Sam's can you see in this shot? We've got lots of reflections happening around here. Anyways, for today's video we are filming Sandwiches Triples which are triple sandwiches. I guess these are going to have three layers of bread and we're eating at one of our favorite eateries in all of Lima. This place is called Manolo and they specialize in Churros but they also have these humongous sandwiches so we're back here again. So Sam, can you count how many times we've been here already? I have no idea. I mean the first time we came to Lima last year I think this was the first restaurant we ever went to together. Yeah. So that is kind of special and we've had everything from sandwiches to lasagna to these giant pieces of lemon meringue pie and we've also had churros here as well. So we're going for the sandwiches right now. So first impressions, our food has arrived, and I asked our waiter is this sandwich big enough to share between two people? And he was like oh no this is small it is a personal size. Have a look at this. Are you kidding me? Personal size. That is massive. And that is not even the biggest one. The biggest one is the other one with chicken. Is the one you're having. And the other thing I'm noticing is that this only has two layers of bread. So I'm a bit confused because I assumed if it is called Triple it would have three layers of bread but apparently not. So, now we don't even know what a triple sandwich means. Maybe it is three ingredients. Who knows. But this one is mine. It as avocado, ham and tomato. So let's dig in. I think it may be the case that the filling, like there is so many toppings and fillings put into this sandwich that there is just no room for an extra layer of bread. Exactly. That is a big mouthful right there. I'm dropping it all over me. But yeah, that is nice. I'm going to grab my napkin and dab dab because I can feel I have mayo all over my face. But yeah, that is good. It's a nice thick slice of fluffy white bread and I like that the slices of avocado and tomato are really thick. So now it is your turn Sam. Tell us what is in your sandwich? Yes, mine is very similar to yours except for that fact that it has generous amount of chicken stuffed inside. So let's not delay. I'm just going to bite right in. So that is shredded chicken, avocado and tomato. Wow. They really make some of the best sandwiches here at Manolo. It just never disappoints. This is just amazing. There is so much avocado and so much chicken and just the bread is so fluffy. It is just amazing. And you know what else? They gave us aji. This spicy yellow sauce. So I think you should add some to your sandwich. Let's do it here. Let's do it. Let's put some spice. Oh wow that is a lot of spice. That is a massive amount. Good luck with that. Your mouth is going to be on fire. Woah. That was way too much. Too hot to handle. Oh, I'm suffering here. So I have barely finished my first piece and Sam is already done his. Or just about. Yeah, pretty much. And what makes this sandwich really unique is that it doesn't have crust. It is similar to the sandwich de miga that we were eating in Argentina as well. And that is really cool because you're just eating the white part of the bread. And you can tell that they make the bread homemade here. Like it is really good quality. Except that I have to say these are way thicker than what you find in Argentina. Oh, the sandwiches there are super thin and light. These are proper sandwiches. This is a proper meal. Yeah. So I had to pack up half my sandwich in order to make room for dessert. But the good news is that now we can have churros. So have a look over here. These are the regular churros. So it is basically this long strip of deep-fried dough with a little bit of sugar on top. And we also have these special ones which are filled with manjar blanco which is quite similar to dulce de leche. And that is not all. We also got hot chocolate so thick that Sam just calls it sauce. This is chocolate sauce. It is not even hot chocolate. I call it chocolate sludge. Sludge. Chocolate sludge. But look at how thick it is. It is so rich. Oh let's dig in. Alright, show us what we came for. So we're going to start off with just a regular churros here because it is perfect for dunking in the chocolate sauce. And I don't just dunk it. I drown mine in there. Look at that. He drowns it. He drowns it in chocolate. I drown it in chocolate. Look at how much chocolate there is. Look at that. Woah, it is so hot too. This is what we came for. Oh yeah. And what really makes it is the chocolate. The hot chocolate. It is so thick and so rich and creamy. So you are going for the premium one. Oh yeah. Look at that. With the manjar blanco. Dipped in chocolate. Seriously. Does it get anymore decadent than that? I don't think so. You've got so much chocolate covering it that you can't even see the manjar blanco. Mmmmmm. That combination is just spectacular. And this is fresh out of the fryer. Seriously, the filling is ooey and gooey and then you've got the chocolate and the sugar sprinkled all over. I just love this. I really do. Oh oh oh. Mmmmm. I wish I could get this for breakfast every single day of my life. But I probably wouldn't be very good for my health. You know Sam you haven't noticed but I'm eating this very quickly so you better get yours fast. So this is the fun part for you Sam isn't it? Yes. The churros are long gone but they are still a little bit of that amazing chocolate sludge left. There is no way I'm going to leave this place with any of that left. Let's not waste chocolate now. It is like the best hot chocolate you've ever had. And then some. Alright, time to do the math. What is the price point for this meal? So it came to 80 Soles and so that is basically just over 20 US dollars. But it is amazing value when you consider it. Gracias. It is amazing value when you consider that we had two massive sandwiches, a drink, two different kinds of churros and a hot chocolate. So we are leaving here very full. Want to show us your belly? Hahaha. Ciao.",False,"20170410 - Peru Food Tour∩╝Ü MUST-TRY Peruvian Street Food & Traditional Dishes in Lima, Cusco, & the Amazon!.en.srt"

Number one, great weather after a really cold week. Number two, we have just moved into a new apartment near Seoul station (서울역) and we know a lot of really good restaurants here. And number three, today we are having Gamjatang (감자탕) for lunch. Yeah, that is really exciting. And it is at least ten degrees warmer so let's walk on over to our restaurant and fill our faces with Korean food. So we are both super excited about this dish because it is one of our favorites soups. It is so so good. Yeah. This Korean soup slash stew is one of the most hearty ones you can have in all of Korea. We're so excited to be here. So if we take a look down here I'm going to explain a bit of what is in this dish. So it is basically the gamjatang (감자탕) is a pork spine stew. It also has potatoes, it has parrilia leaves, it has ground sesame and it has a bunch of other vegetable ingredients as well. And it also has glass noodles that are already in there but we ordered. That is not enough for Sam. NO. We ordered a special supplement of ramen (라면) which we're going to pour in a little bit later. Ah, we want to wait for it to cook a bit longer before we add that. But yeah, it is such a nice Korean stew. And if you can believe this if you look down here one more time this is actually the small version of this. The small size. Yeah, you can get also get a medium and large and that would make the most sense if you were with a group of maybe say three to four people. Friends or family. A group of people. Friends, family. So we're going with the smaller portion which actually isn't very small. Okay so they have come and turned down the fire so I think it is ready. We let it cook for about ten minutes. It is still bubbling up a storm though. That is some serious bubbles. Check that out. Some serious action. So I'm going to dish it up. Look at all of that steam. My gosh. The pork spine and let's add the ramen (라면) noodles which Sam was really craving. Yeah, that was a must addition for me. Oh my. I mean when it is only two thousand Won (원) extra to add it. Why not, right? There you go. Some broth. We've already got a parrila leaf in there. You've got yourself a nice big portion. Oh that is for me? That is for you. Oh my. Lucky me. And you're going to serve up yours as well? Yes. I'm going to claim this potato for myself. Yeah. So what is cool about this dish is that it dates back to the Three Kingdom Period of Korea which is a very long time ago and it is from Jeolla Province (전라도). JeollaNamdo province (전라남도) if I'm correct. So that is really cool and I think we're ready to eat it soon. Yeah, enough information. Let's dig in. Alright, so now comes the dissection process. So I'm going to use my chopsticks to pick off the meat off of the pork-spine. Yep. And the meat has been cooking for a really long time so it is like super soft and tender. And just so you know we have a special bowl here that we put the bones eventually. But we're not quite at that stage yet. Yeah, we're still at the stage of eating the meat. Yeah, so this dish like you really have to work for it to enjoy it. It is quite a bit of work to get at the meat but it is so tender and it just falls apart. So I really enjoy it. I'm really excited for this. You've gotta have some. You've got to admire a dish where you have to do a little bit of the work yourself. Let's see. Let's try that. Mmmm. How is it? Oh my gosh. The meat like melts in your mouth. It is so so tender. So tender. And is the broth of the soup spicy? Yeah, it is one of the spicier broths. It kind of looks like a bit like it has a gochujang (고추장) base. Like a red pepper paste. Yeah. Yeah. And we have a bit of this. If I remember correctly this should be kind of like a mustard. Kind of a mustard. Like a green mustard. Let's see. Dip a bit with the meat. Put it in there. Mmmm. Gives it a bit of a kick? Oh my gosh. You're going to love this. This is so good. I'm loving it. Yeah. So before I try my gamjatang (감자탕) the first thing I want to point out is that we made a really big mistake the first time we ever had this. So in order for me to talk about it you've got to look down here. Okay. So the worst thing you can do when you're having gamjatang (甘藷湯) is to just let it sit because while it is cooking it can get really sticky at the bottom so it is really important to keep moving it around to keep things floating. You can see over here I've got a big potato. Yeah, and so it is important to keep the ingredients moving around. And we've also turned down the heat to just let it simmer. Yes. Very key point. So putting the ladle down. I'm going to try my first bite. Alright. I'm going to go in for the noodles since you had the meat already. Hahaha. I'm going to try and have. I'm going to see if I grab a little bit of meat over here. That is mostly bone. Yeah. Okay, there is a little bit of meat. I'm getting I think a parrila leaf and I'm getting some noodles. A little bit of everything. Let's try that. Well? Oh yeah, that is really good. Your first bite of gamjatang (감자탕) in how many years? The last time I had this was in Yongin (용인) where you used to live. My neighborhood. That was like three or four years ago. No, it was four years ago. That is ridiculous how long it has been. So nice to be having this again and I love like you said I love how tender the meat is. I love how spicy it is and the noodles as a supplement were a really nice addition. Yeah and we could actually add different suppliments like if you wanted. Yeah. Dumplings. There is mandu (만두). Rice cakes. There was tteok (떡) which is the rice cakes. Yeah, there was a whole bunch of different ones you can choose from. We decided just to go for one to try to keep it more classic but you can go nuts if you want. So I'm having my second serving over here. Oh la lah. And if you take a look at my little dish you can see that I've got a bit potato this time around. Yeah. And what is fascinating about this dish is gamjatang (甘藷湯) if you take it literally 'gamcha' means potato but actually that is not the main ingredient of this soup. Potato is more of an optional thing. What is the main ingredient is the Korean pork spine. Yeah. So that is really important point to point out because first time like four years ago we made a video about this dish and we were saying oh yeah it is potato soup. It is a potato stew. A Korean potato stew. And actually that is incorrect. It is Korean pork spine stew and it often it does have potatoes but it can also not have potatoes as well. So now that we've made a big deal about the potatoes let's try that with some of the broth. It is still really hot. So I'm blowing on it. Mmmmm. Yeah, the potatoes are really nice addition. And another interesting thing about this dish is that everyone has their own method to getting off the meat. Some people pick at it a little bit and then have a little bite here and there. Others like to work through the bone and get it all out at once. I have to say there is not a ton of meat on the bone. There is a little bit so to get to scrape that meat off it does require quite a bit of work with your spoon and chopsticks. Well we sure took care of that. Nothing but an empty bowl. Empty bowl and lots of bones. So yeah that was a super filling meal. We're leaving stuffed and you know what. Our noses are running a bit because we are used to Korean spices but this is especially spicy. Actually your lips look swollen right now. My lips are on fire at the moment. So anyways on to price point. So if you take a look here you can see that the gamjatang (감자탕) it came to twenty thousand Won (원) and then we have a supplement of rice for one thousand and a supplement of mandu (만두) for two thousand more. So in total twenty three thousand Won (원). W23,000 KRW which is roughly a little bit less than twenty US dollars. So you're looking at like less than ten dollars a person. And when you come and have a Korean soup or stew that is this good it is definitely worth it. So it is one of the must try Korean foods we recommend when visiting Seoul (서울). And what is even better this place is open 24 hours. Yeah, exactly. So if you've enjoyed the video please give it a thumbs up and stay tuned because we have more Korea food videos and travel videos coming out every Monday. So for today's lunch we are having Kimchi Bokkeumbap (김치 볶음밥) which is a fried rice made with spicy fermented cabbage. We have ordered two varieties and that is being made at the moment. So you can probably here all the noise in the kitchen. So I have to say this is my absolute favorite Korean fried rice (볶음밥). I mean kimchi (김치) tastes fantastic on its own but there is just something special about when it is fried and mixed in with rice and oil and all these other ingredients. And the cool thing about Kimchi Bokkeumbap (김치 볶음밥) is that it doesn't just come in one variety. We're getting two different kinds. We're getting a special kind for you which is called Chamchi Kimchi Bokkeumbap (참치 김치 볶음밥) which is kimchi fried rice made with tuna. Yeah. And I'm getting Cheolpan Cheese Kimchi Bokkeumbap (철판 치즈 김치 볶음밥). Oh, wow. Here it is. Gamsahamnida (감사 합니다). It is just right here. It comes basically it is Kimchi Bokkeumbap (김치 볶음밥). It comes in like a stone pot and then on top of it you have melted cheese. Lots of cheese. Wonderful. Officially this is called Cheolpan Cheese Kimchi Bokkeumbap (철판 치즈 김치 볶음밥) and that means. You decipher that for us. So the cheolpan (철판) is kind of like, I believe it is the stone pot. The cheese is obviously the cheese and the kimchi bokkeumbap (김치 볶음밥) is obviously the star of the meal. Here the kimchi fried rice (김치 볶음밥). So we're all set. Let's dig in. So my meal has also arrived and I'm having the Chamchi Kimchi Bokkeumbap (참치 김치 볶음밥). So if you take a look down here you've got your spicy rice with the fermented cabbage. We also have the chamchi (참치) which is the tuna and it comes with little bits of seaweed (김) and a fried egg (계란) on top. So it is kind of runny so you basically just break it and mix it all in together. Break that egg open. That is really good. Wow. Sometimes I eat this for breakfast but today it is my lunch. I know, when we first came back to Korea we had this at like two thirty in the morning. Yeah. It was hilarious. And that is the fascinating thing about eateries in Korea. They are open 24 hours. Yeah, especially these gimbap (김밥) places. They're open 24 hours and you can come in any time of day and get anything you want. Gotta love that about Korea. So going in for a first bite here. Mmmmm. That is nice. It is just like such a hearty filling meal. You know, it is mostly rice in this dish but it is nice and spicy. So simple flavors but it is good. It all works together. Mmmm. And yours is looking ooey and gooey with all of that cheese on top. Look at all of that cheese. Let at that stretch like that. Oh my gosh. I'm going to have to like parse it off here. And Sam is a huge fan of pizza so putting cheese on rice is just perfect. Hahaha. Mmmmm. What do you think? That is amazing. The best part about it aside from the Kimchi Bokkeumbap (김치 볶음밥) is obviously the melted cheese on top. But also what is really cool about this cheolpan (철판) here is that because it is made in a stone pot it is really crispy on the bottom. So you get that nice crispy burnt rice and that just makes it like so much more delicious than regular rice. Oh yeah. So we also got some free side dishes and that is another thing we love about Korea. It doesn't matter what you ordering they're always going to give you a little something to taste until your meal gets here. So we got some kimchi (김치) here which is your fermented cabbage. Again this just makes an appearance in so many different forms. I know, even though we're having it as the main dish as gimchi (김치) you can never get enough of that. We'll definitely finish that side dish amount of kimchi (김치). But you know what the flavors are so much more intense when you're eating like the fresh kimchi (김치). It is more like pickled and almost vinegar-y. Yep. Um, and let's try this other thing. And I think that is the. I think that is radish. I think that is yellow radish. I think it is called Danmuji (단무지). And that is something I can't remember exactly. I've been gone from Korea a bit too long. Mmmm. But you find that a lot with, especially with Chinese Korean restaurants. I mean it is a staple in kimbap (김밥) restaurant too but it is always with Chinese Korean food. But you know what this one was a little bit sweeter so I'm not a huge fan. I prefer the spice to be honest. Yeah. Does it reset your a palate a bit though? I guess it does. If you need a break from that burning sensation. Hahaha. And we've got more side dishes. So over here some kind of green vegetable. I don't think it is spinach even though it looks like it. And it also has some sesame seeds, a little bit of onion. A little bit of carrot. Let's get it all in. Yeah. That is good. Well, we are just about done. So let's do price point. We polished that off with authority guys. I needed help. You had to help me. Yeah, I probably had half of yours. Kimchi Bokkeumbap (김치 볶음밥) is just too. Just way too delicious to leave on the table. So, in terms of price point that was eleven thousand five hundred Won (원). ₩11,500. And yours was 5,500 and mine was 6,000 and now if you get just a regular Kimchi Bokkeumbap (김치 볶음밥) that is 5000. So two of those would be a little bit less. Anyways, the stuff that we got came to roughly about ten US dollars. So really good value. Five dollars per person and we are leaving stuffed. Especially me. New videos from South Korea every week! Click here! Well hello hello. So we have another food video coming to you from Seoul, South Korea. And today we are having Budae Jjigae (부대찌개) so check this out. This is basically an Army Stew. Korean Army Stew and half of the ingredients are American. Because after the Korean War food supplies were kind of low so Koreans started making their way to the American Military Bases and there they found hot dogs, spam, ham so it has some rather unusual ingredients for Korean food. Yeah, this is kind of known as the leftover soup or stew. It has got a lot of strange ingredients all thrown in together but it is a delicious super and stew. We've had it before and we're excited to try it again. So the traditionally Korean ingredients are things such as gochujang (고추장) the red pepper paste sauce and also they have kimchi (김치) and we ordered two supplements. And on the menu they were called Sari (사리) and so we ordered Ramen (라면) which are the noodles if you take a look down here. You can see the noodles cooking. We've got two sets of noodles. And the other thing that we ordered as a supplement and add in was Mandu (만두). The dumplings. Of course those are the Korean dumplings and I just broke one off. Destorying out meal. Whoopsies. Alright, so I guess now we just let it cook. Now we wait for it to boil. It is the hurry up and wait time. Yeah. And because this is a Korean meal we couldn't forget the side dishes. Yeah. Always present. So while we're waiting for this to cook let's give you a tour of the banchan (반찬). So let's start here. We have the kongnamul (콩나물) bean sprouts, we have the kimchi (김치) the fermented cabbage, we have kind of the fish cakes and then we have the greens. So it is a nice mix and then we were each given a thing of rice. A bowl of rice. Rice. You always have rice at the table. Yeah. It doesn't matter what you're having. You never have a Korean soup or stew without rice by your side. It is mandatory. It is mandatory. So our host at the restaurant just off or either turned down our heat in the pot so I think it is ready to eat. And as you can see the noodles definitely look cooked now. Yeah. We also discovered it had some different kind of noodles as well. They have they are called the Korean glass noodles. So we have some other mystery ingredients. We also found that there was some tofu put in as well. Yeah, you can see the big chunks of tofu there. And I mean really how long do you have to cook spam and hot dogs. I feel like this all good to go. So you're getting the toppings first. And then you're going to get some soup. A little bit of everything. Yes, some tofu. Love me some tofu. Trying to keep the camera away so it doesn't fog up. But I'll zoom in to your bowl. So there we go. I think I have a little bit of everything. What else? Maybe some kimchi (김치)? Yeah, add some kimchi (김치). Do you have enough soup? Yes. Tada. Okay, so going in for my first bite. Let's have a look down here. Honestly, I think the last time I ate hot dogs willingly okay was probably either the last time I had Budae Jjigae (부대찌개) or when I was in middle school when I would slice hot dogs and mix them in with potatoes. Yeah, we're not big fans of it on its own but it somehow works in this stew. In this Korean soup. Spraying everywhere. Spicy. Alright let's see what else we can find here. Maybe some noodles, kimchi and they are like slipping off of my chopsticks. Hahaha. Got some skill here. It is still steaming. I don't know if you can see that. Oh yeah. We can see it. Especially if we look down at the pot. Yeah, it is interesting. How is it? It is good. It is kind of interesting having like Korean ingredients and American ingredients and it is like fast food from both cultures because you've got like ramen noodles which are super popular here you can get them to go and hot dogs. So yeah, it is an interesting meal for sure. But you have to try it when you come to Korea. It is one of those must have dishes. Just for the experience. Alright, time for me to go in for my first bite. First bite. A bit of tofu and a bit of noodles. Mmmmm. How is it? It is quite tasty. Yeah. Yeah. Perfect on a cold day like today. So we have overcooked ours a little bit. The water has evaporated. We've turned it off. I think it has been mostly absorbed by the noodles but that is okay. And it is starting to stick. We're going to have some nice thick noodles to eat. Yeah, this looks more like a stew than a soup now. Yep. Check it out. Most definitely. All bundled up ready to face the outdoors. Yeah, it is another cold day here in November in Korea. So in terms of price point that was very reasonable. The Budae Jjigae (부대찌개) came to six thousand Won (원) per person. So twelve thousand in total. And with the mandu (만두) and ramyeon (라면) supplement that brought it up to fifteen thousand Won (원) so W15,000 KRW which is roughly just over like twelve US dollars. So pretty cheap to eat all of that food. In terms of the quality and the taste it is definitely something that we both think is good but compared to other traditional Korean soups and stews like jjigaes. Yeah like Sundubu jjigae (순두부찌개) and Kimchi jjigae (김치찌개) for example are not quite up to that standard. So we would have this every once in a while. So good morning from Seoul, South Korea. It is a beautiful day out and we are starving. We haven't had breakfast today and it is almost lunchtime. So we're going out for Mandu (만두). Yeah, this is one of our favorite Korean snacks and we can't wait to show you what it is all about. Let's go eat. Alright, so the dumplings have arrived. Yeah, so super exciting moment for me right now. Hahaha. We really like this restaurant. It is just behind Hapjeong station (합정역) and they do specialize in Mandu (만두) so let's take a look down here. Oh but first. Oh, cool. We also got Manduguk (만두국). Gamsahamnida. But back to the main dish. Yeah, back to the main dish. You ordered a platter of Mandu (만두). Yep. Do you want to tell us a bit about it? So take a look down here. This is called Modum Mandu (모듬만두) and what that means is kind of assorted Mandu (만두). So we got a whole bunch of different kinds. There is kind of like there is your regular Kimchi Mandu (김치만두) there is your meat mandu (만두). I think there is a curry mandu (카레만두) and there is another kind so we're going to sample all of them. We're going to be trying all of those. Five different types. Yeah and you can see their different shapes too which is really cool. Oh la lah. And then the other dish that we got which is right in front of you if we look down there is Manduguk (만두국). So that is basically your Mandu soup. So I'm starting with the rather unusual one. This is stuffed with curry. Mmmm. It stuck to my palette. There we go. Yeah, so it is not your average Indian curry. It is like your Korean curry so it is kind of mild, yellow in color and yeah it is interesting. I've never had a curry dumpling before. Mmmm. Okay so we have two orange dumplings. This one here and this one so it has to be kimchi (김치) just based on the color alone. I'm not sure if there is a difference. Maybe one of them also has meat. I think the round one might have meat. The one that you picked up. So I'm just going to dig right in. Mmmmm. Oh my. Spicy! Spicy! This is like kimchi (김치) and spice. Wow. Oh. Weren't expecting that huh? Whew. Oh, your turn. Haha. So I've been having my Mandu (만두) plain but technically you're supposed to make a little sauce for it. Yeah. So this is a kind of a soy vinegar mixture here. Yeah. So we're going to pour a bit of this in here and then we have kind of some chili powder. Just a little bit. That stuff is potent man. So I'm going to mix that around with the chopsticks. Yep. And voila. We have our mix. So which one are you going to try? Alright, I think I'll try this one over here which I'm not entirely sure. I think this might be a gogi one which is meat. But I'll find out in a moment. So put it in the dip. One bite. Mmmm. That is a sweet meat one. Oh, maybe it is bulgogi (불고기)? I think it is bulgogi (불고기). It does taste like bulgogi (불고기). There you go. Oh man that is so good. This place does awesome mandu (만두). Alright, let's go in for round two. Alright so round two will be the other mystery one. That looks like the classic like pork, noodles. Yeah, we'll see what that one is. Again, you are right. Haa. How do you know all this stuff? I know them all. How do you know this stuff? I come here very often. This is a very budget friendly meal so when I was first teaching in Korea and I had no money I would go and get mandu (만두) for like two dollars and fifty cents. Haha. So I mean we can't really go wrong with this. No you can't. Okay, and let's go for the third one that we haven't tried which is the other kimchi (김치) one. And hopefully that one won't be as spicy but we'll see how you fare. Mmmmm. You know what? That one it is spicy but it also a bit sweet. So I definitely think it is different from the one you had but you do taste the kimchi (김치) but you also taste quite a bit of meat as well. Oh. Really good. So for myself I ordered the manduguk (만두국) so let's have a look at the bowl here. This is a very light broth. It has some like some whisked eggs in there, um some seaweed, some pepper and lots of dumplings so you can just fish them out and put them on this little side bowl. So yeah this is kind of like the type of meal you'd want to eat if you have a cold or you're feeling kind of sick. It is nice fall food. Yeah, it is like I see it as the Korean version of like a chicken noodle soup. Even though there is no chicken but you know what I mean it is just like a light broth. So there we have the classic mandu (만두) in there. This looks like the pork, noodle, veggie variety. And it is still steaming so I don't want to burn myself. Yeah, that is something we have a bad habit of doing when we eat. We often burn ourselves. We don't blow on our food to let it cool down. That is nice. How is that? I like this one because it is not spicy. It is just like very mild simple food and we'll grab some egg and some seaweed. And you know it is starting to get really cold out so it is also just a nice meal to be enjoying indoors. Mmmm. That is really nice. Love this dish. It is a classic. Alright Sam, so do you want to give us a lesson on the history of mandu (만두)? So they think it possibly came from Mongolia or from the Middle East via Central Asia along the silk road. And so it shares a lot of similarities with Central Asian Manti (Manty) yeah. Mahnti. Manti. And also Tibetan Momos. Yeah. And it also reminds us a little bit of the kind of dumplings you get in different parts of the world like Pierogi in Poland and also empanadas in South America so it is a food we're very familiar with and it is something we love. Also when you come to Korea you can get them in different forms. The ones we're having here are steamed but you can also get them pan-fried and they're called gunmandu (군만두) and they're typically in Korean Chinese restaurants. And you can also get giant sized ones and they're called Wang Mandu (왕만두) and they're also really good so there is a lot of different ones you can try. Highly recommend it. It is one of our favorite Korean snacks. In terms of price point the Mandu platter. The modum Mandu (모듬만두) came to three thousand five hundred Won and the Manduguk (만두국) the soup was five thousand Won so in total that was W8500 KRW. So really good value. That is about around seven US dollars and this place is so popular they have two locations right beside each other and once again it is behind Hapjeong station (합정역) so definitely check it out if you're in Seoul. And someone has a mouthful of candy. Yeah. How are you able to speak? I have two mints in my mouth right now. So you get free candy at the end. Multitasking over here. Well good afternoon. I have just woken up from my afternoon nap and I decided hey street food would be pretty nice. So we decided to check out a local market. Korean street food is a good idea anytime of day as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, so we're at the Mangwon Market (망원시장). This is a really cool market here in Seoul (서울). It is not one of those popular touristy markets. It is very much a local market. It is nearby Hapjeong (합정) and also Hongdae (홍대) area. So we're just going to check it out. We're going to show you guys what you can find here as well as sample a whole bunch of different Korean street food (한국 길거리 음식) here in Seoul. Let's do it. Exciting times. Let's start eating. So we're starting off with the cheon won (천원) menu. The one thousand won (원) menu. This should be awesome. Anyeonghaseyo. Danhobak (단호박) hana. Gamsahamnida. Got it right here. Let's eat it. This one is for you. It was cheaper. It was only 500 hundred Won (원). Are you serious? It was five hundred won (원). W500 KRW for that. Yeah. Look at that. So it looks like a donut but it is actually a croquet. I saw that when I ordered. Okay. A pumpkin croquet. So we were way off. But hey, I love getting a deal this is literally half price than what I thought. Let's dig in. So let's try this. I've ever this before. This is fascinating for me because I've tried most Korean street food (한국 길거리 음식). But I never tried this. I'm curious to see if it is going to be savory or sweet. Mmmm. It is actually kind of both. It is a little bit sweet but it is also savory. I've got to have another bite. I guess the dough is probably more savory since it has been deep-fried. Yeah. And the pumpkin would be sweet? Mmmm. Give us a good luck. Look at this. You can see you can really see the pumpkin here. Oh. You can really see the pumpkin here. Look at that. That almost looks like curry. Yeah, it is. I'm actually going to correct myself. It is a bit more savory than it is sweet. More savory than sweet. Alright, well you are clearly enjoying it. It is like falling out of your mouth. I'm wolfing it down over here. (Speaking Korean) Mandu (만두). yachae (야채). Okay, so do you want to tell us what you ordered? Yeah, absolutely. We're having Tteokbokki (떡볶이) which is basically my all-time favorite Korean street food snack. So let's take a look down here. I'll give you a tour. And the tteokbokki (떡볶이) part here is basically the Korean rice cakes in a gochujang sauce (고추장). A spicy red pepper sauce and then you also have fishcakes and then over here I ordered something called twigim (튀김) which is basically the fried battered objects that come along with it. Objects? Mostly vegetables. So I have like mandu (만두). Okay dumpling. This one if called yachae (야채) which is different vegetables and then over here we also have. I think there is sweet potato somewhere in there. Yes, sweet potato which is kokuma (고구마). Can't wait to try all of that. Alright, I'm going to start off with the tteokbokki (떡볶이). Dig in. Here we go. One big piece of rice cake. That is a giant sized rice cake. It is like extra long. Oh, massiseoyo (맛있어요). Massiseoyo. Ne. Very delicious. Korean tteokbokki (떡볶이). Yeah, very good. Massiseoyo (맛있어요). Oh, that is awesome. Such good tteokbokki (떡볶이). And now we're going to try the twikim. So I'm taking the sweet potato piece here. I'm going to take it for a swim here in the gochujang sauce (고추장). Yep. And let's try that. A little messy over there. Don't burn yourself. A little bit too big of a bite. It is like fresh out of the deep fryer. That is my favorite twigim (튀김). Yeah. If you're going to try one kind of twigim (튀김), in Korea with your tteokbokki (떡볶이) then make sure you get the kokuma (고구마) you get the sweet potato. It is just so good. So sweet, so delicious. And it tastes so good when it is crispy. So before I gobble all of the twigim (튀김) and tteokbokki (떡볶이) why don't I share a little bit with you. Share. So I'm going to add some sauce to mine. So this is pretty cool. It is kind of like a spicy soy chili sauce with sesame seeds. Oh yeah. So you can use a spoon if you want to get lots of it. Or you can use this little brush and just paint the twigim (튀김). That is awesome so you're. It gives it a lot more flavor. It makes it spicier. You're going to try the twigim (튀김) then. Which one do you have? Mandu (만두). Mandu (만두)? How is that? It is nice and spicy. It is good. I like a lot better with the sauce. It gives it more flavor. So even though you can find lots of street food here that is not the only thing they sell at this market. You can also get lots of fresh produce, fruits, vegetables. They have butchers. You can buy clothes, you can buy school supplies. So a little bit of everything. There is definitely lots of variety here. Ah, tteok (떡) hana. So which package are you getting Audrey? I guess this one. The little ones. Gamsahamnida. Gamsahamnida. I forgot to count my money. It is two thousand Won (원). So what did you get Audrey? So I got myself some little rice cakes. I'm not going to eat them right now because we've been having a lot of street food. I'm taking this home for later as a little snack. They come in different colors but the filling is often the same for all of them. Um, it might be red bean paste. That is what it usually is with the bigger ones. I'm not sure with the little ones. Yeah, they have different fillings and these are called tteok (떡) and I think these might be songpyeong. I think these might be the ones that are had. That you have on special holidays and they're especially sweet. They are sweeter than most. So they are really good. Okay so we just finished covering one half of the market. Now we're, I nearly got run over there. Now we're going to cross the street and visit the second half of the market which continues on the other side of the road and I've been holding out for sweets so I really hope I can find some hotteok (호떡) when we are there. Another thing I find really amusing is that people are going through the market on a motorbikes even though it is a pedestrian only area or so it would seem. So you have to be careful and kind of watch out because they come out of nowhere. Tteokkochi (떡꼬치) almaeyo. 500 or 1000. Cheon Won (천원) juseyo. Ne. Clearly somebody hasn't tired of the rice cakes today. Yeah, sticking with the theme of the rice cakes for this afternoon I've got another Korean street food snack here. We've got something called tteokkochi (떡꼬치). So I'm going to take a bite and then describe it to you after. Mmmm. So how this is different from tteokbokki (떡볶이) is that the sauce is completely different. This is more like a sweet and sour type of chili sauce that is on top of it. And also the rice cakes have been cooked differently. They've been obviously cooked a little bit longer and they are crispier but also still chewy while you are chewing them. So this is almost a little bit almost like a dessert snack. So are the rice cakes pan-fried then? I think they are. Yeah, because they are crispy on the outside. Yeah. So really good. And again this one was only cheon Won (천원) so less than one US dollar. Can't go wrong. It is kind of funny with this dish I had never tried it in Korea but then when we were in Kyrgyzstan. Your first time to try it was in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. They had a Korean restaurant. Korean restaurant so there you go. Which is kind of unusual. Going to go in for more. Mmmmm. So if you had to choose do you prefer tteokbokki (떡볶이) or tteokkochi (떡꼬치)? They are nothing alike so it is comparing apples with oranges. But right now I've had quite a bit of savory things so I'm appreciating the kind of sweet chili sauce on this. A very diplomatic answer. So your'e up again. What have you got? I found my favorite all-time Korean street snack. This is called hotteok (호떡) and it kind of looks like a donut or a really fat pancake and it is usually filled with brown sugar and pine nuts and cinnamon. Yours is a special one. What is yours? This one is nokcha (녹차) so this is green tea hotteok (호떡) which I have never had before. And just looking at it. It looks like it has got little bit of like green tea like loose leaf. Yeah. Yeah. So let's see what it tastes like. Try that. Ah, it is so hot. Piping hot. It is freshly made. Just made that for you. Have you got to the gooey part in the middle yet. Haven't got to the gooey part. I don't know if there is a gooey part. Maybe this one is just sprinkled with green tea. First impressions though is it sweet? It tastes like a sweet donut. So far so good. I think it may have a filling though. Ahh. Here we go. So look at that. There you have your brown caramelized sugar, some nuts, a little bit of green tea loose leaf, cinnamon. It smells amazing. And you call it smells like Christmas, right? I think that is one of the reasons I like it so much. It is just like such a comforting aroma. It smells like Christmas. It is so so good. And I'm burning myself right now having this but it is just so good. I don't really want to wait. And how much was it? One thousand Won (원). Wow another cheon Won (천원). So less than a dollar. We're just feasting like Kings and Queens here without paying much at all. We sure are. So someone couldn't resist temptation. He's having some hotteok (호떡) too. You know what? You were kind enough to share so I really appreciate that because we were just supposed to kind of each get our own things but let's try it. Oooh. This is definitely my favorite Korean street food dessert snack. Like bar none. This is so good. I could eat this everyday and probably not get sick of it. And we decided we couldn't wait until we got home to try the rice cakes. I know. Considering I just had something sweet the hotteok (호떡) it was like I could have a little something else and I've already bought these. So I'm going to dig in to the rice cakes. And I wonder if the green ones are like green tea flavored or anything like that. I think the white one is going to be sweet and the pink one. I'm not sure about the green one though. Let's try the pink one. These are little. These are like mini sized. Let's see what is in them. Mmmm. It is not red bean paste. It is like a sweet jelly. It is orange but I have no idea what kind. No idea what it is. I've never had this before. Does it taste good. It tastes great. Yeah. Alright, I'm going in for one. Here comes the hand. Ha. Let's see if you can decipher the mystery ingredient. It is almost like syrupy. Mmmm. Look at that. Mmmm. Those are so good. I know. Those are so good I'm having one more. One more. Open it up. I'm going to have a pink one. I think they all have the same filling though. Wow that is delicious. Yeah. So how did you enjoy this market? It was awesome. I really appreciate this market because it has such a local feel as opposed to feeling like a touristy market and that made it a lot of fun. There are people that who are in the market that were curious about what we were doing. Nobody was jaded, nobody told us hey no pictures no taking video. Everyone was like really in to what we were doing. And that was awesome. I think it is just a cool alternative to some of the more popular markets in Seoul. And it is just one stop away from Hapjeong on the brown line so if you come here you can go to Mangwon station and go out exit two and then it is just five minute walk and you're here. Yeah. You turn left at the exit and then left again at the next major intersection. Yeah, so it is not far at all. So highly recommend coming here and man am I ever full. So for today's video we are at a place called Sulbing (설빙) and this is a popular chain in Korea that specializes in frozen desserts (디저트). We're going to be trying something that is quite similar to Patbingsu (팥빙수) and Patbingsoo (팥빙수) is a shaved ice dessert with red beans. But we're having Sulbing (설빙) which is actually frozen milk that has been shaved into these little snowflakes so you get a much creamier dessert (디저트). And we've ordered two different varieties so those are coming up. Yeah, and the Sulbing (설빙) is basically your quintessential Korean summer dessert. Yes, and it is super hot out so we're cooling down with that right now. Look at what she's got. It is here. Lalalala. So dessert (디저트) is here. Yeah. So I got the blueberry cheesecake Sulbing (설빙). So let's take a look at that. And before I even begin to talk about this. I've got to show you just how big this is with a sense of scale. Like this is my hand. This thing is like bigger than my frickin' hand basically. So the coolest thing that stands out to me aside from obviously how big it is is that there are real blueberries. Like look at this. Yeah. Real big thick blueberries. So that is going to be my first bite. And I'm going to get a piece of the cheese and the sauce here. Along with some shaved ice. I sense a brain freeze coming up. Yeah pretty much. It is frozen. Frozen but you know what delicious. The kind of topping they put on is also a glazed. A blueberry glaze. And it is similar to the glaze that you would put on a cheesecake. And then you get those nice big thick blueberries. And on top of that the refreshing-ness of the shaved condensed milk. The shaved ice. And then the big chunks of cheesecake. This is just a wonderful summer dessert. And you also have ice cream there. Yours is topped with ice cream. I'm a little jealous right now. Mine doesn't come with ice cream. Seriously guys this is like to beat the thirty five degree weather in Korea in August. Oh, and one more thing it comes with milk. Just pour that on. Just pull it all over. Wow. It looks like condensed milk. Oh, now that is a thing of beauty guys. Oh la lah. Oh yeah, I'm going to enjoy this one. Okay, so mine is here as well. I ordered the chocolate brownie. I've had this one before. It is delicious. So why bother trying something new. Like when you walked in here you're like I'm getting the chocolate brownie. There was no negotiations there. I'm just pouring the milk. I want it and I'm going to eat it all too, right? Yeah. So let me give you a tour of the bowl. So basically you've got your shaved milk down here and all around you have chunks of brownie, cheesecake, brownie, cheesecake. And then you have whipped cream right here and it is all topped off with a chocolate powder and chocolate sauce. The cocoa powder as well too. Yeah. So look at that. Wow. So let's have the first bite. It is so big it is like falling over from the sides. I don't want to waste any of it. Mmmmm. I'm so scared of the brain freeze. Mmmm. That is so good. Wow. I almost feel like I want to let it melt a little bit and turn into a milkshake. Then mix it all together. That is how I like my Bingsu (빙수). Mmmm. So I think one of the things we both really enjoy about this dessert (디저트) is that it just keeps on giving. It is full of surprises. It is so big. So if you take a look at my bowl. So many layers. I just discovered that mine has Oreo cookie crumbs like towards the bottom. I had no idea it came with Oreo cookies so that was a nice surprise. And same with yours. You ended up finding more fruit in the middle right? I know and like there is actually more blueberry sauce at the bottom of it. So it is like as you keep going you keep getting more surprises. I know. And I'm already full and I haven't even finished half of my dessert. Keep going. We're going to be here a while. Well, thank you Sam for helping me finish that. Was it tasty? Yeah. Which did you prefer? Chocolate brownie or blueberry cheesecake? They're both really good but the blueberry cheesecake was like amazing. Amaze-balls! Like that is like ninety something and yours is like low 90's or high 80's. So yeah still good. Doing some percentages here. Alright, so time for the price. How much did the Bingsu (빙수) cost? So mine was ₩10,000 ten thousand Won (원). And yours was eight thousand five hundred ₩8,5000 Won (원) and so total 18,500. So you're looking at around seventeen US bucks. So not bad. We were a little greedy. We probably could have just got one I'd say. One would have been enough and we had Tteokbokki (떡볶이) for lunch so oooh. I have a bit of a gut bomb now. But if you want to cool off on a hot day in Korea definitely recommend this though. Alright, so tata. New videos from South Korea every week. Click here. So we are starting off by having one of our favorite Korean meals. This is Korean style Shabu-Shabu (샤브샤브). And unlike other types of syabu-syabu (샤브샤브) where you have like Japanese and Chinese Shabu-Shabu (しゃぶしゃぶ) Shabu Shabu (샤브샤브) is unique in the sense that it comes with three different courses. Yeah. So even before we cook it here for you, all these nice aromas and the steam is coming rising. Before we even do that let's take a look at the toppings. And I can explain things a bit more clearly. So this is first. Yeah, so these are your plate of vegetables, you've got Mandu (만두) which are the Korean dumplings, you've got pumpkin all kinds of different lettuce and then over here you have the meat which is the Shabu-Shabu (샤브샤브). Basically this is like your thinly sliced beef. So after we're done cooking the meat and the vegetables we cook the noodles and these are called Kalguksu (칼국수). They are handmade noodles. They are awesome. That is one of my favorite parts but actually my very favorite part is right at the end. We add this rice and we turn it kind of into kind of basically you use over your leftover syabu-syabu (샤브샤브) and you kind of turn it into a bokkeumbap (볶음밥) which is a Korean style fried rice. And it is awesome. So no more rambling. Let's get cooking. Let's start cooking. So the broth is boiling which means it is time to start cooking our food. So we're just going to drop in the greens first. Look at all of the different assorted greens. Oh my. Like there is just a tonne. And some mushrooms. Look at these. Yeah and the key point here is that you actually definitely want to cook your greens before you start cooking the meat. Because the meat cooks almost on an instant. Instantaneously. Yeah, in like a second. Throw all of that in there. You know what? We're supposed to be using our scissors. That is what they're for. So I'm just going to dig right in here with my hands and this is going to make it easier to eat the vegetables. We should have been doing that from the get go. Whoops. Whoopsies. So we're just waiting for those vegetables and mushrooms to cook and then we're going to put in the meat. And I think I can say we're both salivating at this point. Yeah. It smells so good. Pretty much just drooling over the pot here. So like we were saying the meat really does cook in like a second or two. Sam is going to demonstrate. Look how thinly sliced this is and it is red. Totally raw right now. Plop it in. Watch this. You swish it around. Swish it around. And that is how Shabu-Shabu (샤브샤브) gets its name. It is basically an onomatopoeia meaning that it is the sound of the syabu-syabu (샤브샤브). The swish. The sound it makes when it is made. Look at that. It is already cooked. Wow. So I think we're finally ready to serve ourselves up some of that delicious shabu shabu. Korean style. The first course is done. Look at that. So I'm going to try and get a bit of everything. So there we go. My bowl is all served up and we have some mushrooms, the beef, tofu, greens, a rice cake and of course the broth. So let's go for the beef. Oh, look at that it is steaming. I'm going to try not to burn myself. That seems to happen every meal. Mmmmm. It is really nice and tender. And it has taken on the flavor from the broth. It is super nice, a little bit of spice at the end. But yeah that is good. Trying that broth directly. Alright, serving myself up a massive bowl here. I think I grabbed too much. Hahaha. That is a big portion. Whoops. Okay. So I'm going to go for some of the lettuce and the meat first. That is a nice big piece of meat. It is super hot. Wow. You know the last time we had Shabu-Shabu (샤브샤브)was actually when we were in Korea. And that was like over three years ago. It is amazing having it again. Like I'm in a very happy place right now. So you're grabbing some more meat over here, huh? I sure am because aside from eating the meat straight out of your soup bowl they also gave you these two sauces. So this one is kind of like soy sauce with a little bit of vinegar and some chives. And then they also have this like sweet chili which is really nice. So I've been dipping my meat. And you know the hardest thing about filming this meal is trying not to get the lens all fogged up from the steam. I know. It is so hot at the table. I'm like literally sweating here. I feel like the makeup is melting off of my face while I eat. Mmmmm. Better with the sauce? That is really nice. It is just nice to mix it up you know? Because we've got a really large portion. So just a little bit of everything is good. Mmmmm. So good. That is so good. Wow. So what are you having over there? Yeah, so aside from just all of the meat and the vegetables there is lots of other ingredients as well. So I've got a rice cake in between my chopsticks here. So I'm going to try that. Mmmmm. Nice and chewy? Yeah, nice and chewy. When you're eating Korean rice cakes (xxx) the thing is you really do need to chew them well. Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing that I'm going to try here is the Mandu (만두). This one has been cooking for so long this is the Korean dumpling. This one has been cooking for so long that it is like kind of turned into a gigantic Mandu (만두). Like a wang Mandu (만두). Let's try this here. That looks a little bit hot. Try not to burn yourself. That is super hot. I'm burning the top of my gums over here but yeah that is really good. That is just kind of your plain standard gogi meat Mandu (만두) here. Mmmm. Lovin' it. So we've been eating the meat and vegetables and we are now ready for round two. This is round 2. So as I dump this in. Carefully. Don't splash! Ooh. This is the official star of round two of our meal. So basically we've moved on from the meat and vegetables. There is still a bit left but now we are cooking the noodles here. The Korean noodles. Okay so it is now time for the noodles. So they are green and orange. I believe these are like vegetable colored. Mmmmm. How is that? Really nice. Wow. They look really thick. From over here. They're chewy too. But yeah, it is really nice because our broth is getting thicker and you can really taste the meat and the vegetables that have been cooking there. So yeah, the noodles have kind of taken on that flavor. It is pretty nice. Alright, and we have officially moved on to phase three which is the bokkeumbap (볶음밥). The rice part. This is my favorite part. So we've done this before. We're just throwing it all in. Putting it in to the broth. Boom. Boom. Alright, so now we have to stir that to make sure it doesn't stick. Alright guys, this is what I've been waiting for. The rice is done. Take a look at that. So we have it all finished here. Basically we left enough ingredients so that there was still quite a bit from the original Shabu-Shabu (しゃぶしゃぶ). Yeah. And then we mixed it all together with the rice and the egg and the sauce absorbed and we let it sit there for a while and we let it cook long enough that I think we've let the rice burn at the bottom. Which is that is the best part. So. Yeah. So we've now shut off the heater but we're letting it get crispy. It is super crispy. Super crispy here. Maybe even a little burnt. Hahaha. Okay, let's try that. Wow. Honestly guys, that is better than just about any kind of bokkeumbap (볶음밥) that you would make just on its own. The leftovers from syabu-syabu (샤브샤브) are incredible. The Korean fried rice. Well Sam, I think you got it all because there isn't much left in there. Yeah, we're pretty much just scrapping at the bottom of the bowl at this point. Yeah, so we finished everything so now it is time to pay the bill. So how much was it? So in terms of price point that was twenty six thousand Won (원). ₩26,000. Which is $23 US dollars right now. And that is for two people so that is fantastic value. And for a three course meal. I know. We're so full. We're leaving satisfied. Come get Shabu-Shabu (샤브샤브) when you're in Korea. So for today's lunch we're actually first at the restaurant. This place is empty. It is about 11 AM but we were super hungry so we are going to be having something called Galbi (갈비) and that is marinated short ribs. You can get pork or beef. We've ordered pork because it is a little bit cheaper and it comes in a really sweet marinade which we really enjoy so we're going to be cooking those at the table. And another thing that sets Kalbi (갈비) apart from say Samgyeopsal (삼겹살) or another meat is that it is cooked over charcoal. So they're going to be bringing that soon and just putting it right there. I know. Super excited. This is like the ultimate Korean grill barbecue experience. Gamsahamnida (감사 합니다). Alright guys, so the star of the meal has arrived. The is the Galbi (갈비) in its marinade which is made out of soy sauce, garlic and sugar. Now we're just waiting for the charcoal to arrive. Gamsahamnida (감사 합니다). Wow. It is here. That is a bit scary. I can feel the heat coming off of it. You can really feel the warmth. It is like campfire style. Yeah. Look at that. Gamsahamnida (감사 합니다). Ye (예). So we also get shrimp which is kind of cool. Wow. Komapsumnida (고맙습니다). Ye (예). That smells great. Like you can already smell the sweetness coming off of the meat. That is so good. I know. I'm like. We've had this, I have to admit we had this maybe two days ago. No, I think it was four or five days. Was it? But like it was so good and coming back here again and filming it. Like we know what we're getting. Oh yes. Our mouth is watering. Yeah, I feel like the Pavlovian dog here. I'm just salivating at the sight of this meat. It looks incredible. So our meat has been cooking for a while. Now we're going to flip it. We'll flip it over. We have the grill master at the table. No, well not exactly. Especially when compared to your Dad. But you know. He's trying. I'm trying. I'm learning a little bit here and there. I think in terms of cooking meat it is attention to detail and you don't want to wait for it to cook too long because at that point you've reached the point of no return. Then you're stuck with really hard meat. Yeah. Exactly, so we're just going to pay attention to this and flip it frequently. So this is what our table looks like right now. Check out all of those side dishes. Yeah, and we still have the rice and jjigae (찌개) left to come. Ooh. Voila! So now we can dig in. Yeah, this is the moment we've been waiting for. Okay, so Sam is ready to assemble his first piece. Oh man, you better believe it. The Galbi (갈비). I can't believe how kind the people are here. The service is incredible. Like they just. They cooked it for us. They didn't have to do that and they did. Which was so nice of them. I think like I mean we could have done it by ourselves but you know it is always nice to have a local doing it because they really know the ins and outs of cooking it. So I am basically. I've got my piece of Galbi (갈비) and I've dipped it into some Ssamjang (쌈장) sauce here. Let me put a little bit more on. I've got onions, I've got lettuce and look here comes the jiggae (찌개). Gamsahamnida (감사 합니다). So it has all been assembled here. Just time to pop it into my mouth. Mmmmm. Just give me a moment here. Hahahaha. Savor it. That was a massive bite. How was it? So incredible. So, yeah. They did an excellent job of cooking it. It is cooked well. I mean when you're having pork, when you're having the Dwaeji Galbi (돼지갈비) you want to make sure it is cooked well enough. And you really taste the marinade and then what I love the Ssamjang (쌈장) gives it a bit of a kick. That has red pepper paste and also the soy paste. And then when you combine it with lettuce and onion it just is aww amazing. The meat is really tender. Alright, so now it is my turn. I'm going to go for the sesame leaves or Perilla leaves. So let's get a piece. This one looks good. I'll dip it into your sauce. Sam stole the sauce. It is my sauce. Not sharing. My sauce. Hahaha. This. What else can I put? Maybe a little bit of Kimchi (김치). Why don't you mix it up a bit. Differently than mine. That is kind of cool. Some of this. Oh, that looks good. Some of this over here. Let's see what else can I add? And oh garlic. Can't forget the garlic. Some of that. And I think that is probably a big enough bite. So just roll it all up. And that is what is so fun about Korean barbecue. It is just like, I mean I think it is so awesome to cook things in front of your table but it is even fun to assemble the meat afterwards. You know, putting it in the lettuce or putting it in the leaf and all of the different ingredients. Mmmhmmm. Man, it is good. It is really nice. It is very sweet. And also the other thing I like - these leaves they almost have like a bit of a minty flavor to them so it is really refreshing when you mix it with the meat. It is a nice combination. I almost like it a little bit more than the lettuce. The more I eat it I'm starting to enjoy that more. It is growing on you. That one is still not my favorite. But it is kind of good. You can have those and I'll take the lettuce. So now we're going to give you a tour off the side dishes (반찬) and we have a lot on the table. Let's start on this side actually. Here we have some kind of salad with a spicy sauce. I'm not even entirely sure what the ingredients are here but it also has some sesame seeds, different greens. We also have this light broth here that I've been drinking while Sam hasn't been paying attention. Yeah, it has got a lot of Pa (파) a lot of onions. Some chives. Cabbage. Then if we go over here this is the soup that comes with the rice. This is the Doenjang jjigae (된장 찌개). Yeah. And that is a soy bean paste soup and you can see the big tofu. The big chunk of tofu there. That is delicious. That is such a nice thing to accompany the kalbi (갈비). We also have lots of onions here and what you're supposed to do is just grab them. Yeah. And stick them in this little bowl and swirl them around a bit. And then over here we have more salad. Right? So this is like a lettuce and yogurt salad with raisins. Which is kind of sweet. It is really nice. Oh, this one is one my favorites. Pumpkin. Oh man, this is really good. That is the date. Sam can have that one because I'm not a huge fan. I love that. And what else, we've got some greens here. This reminds me of baby bok choy. I'm not sure if that is right or not. And then over here we have Kimchi (김치). Gimchi (김치). Yep. And then we have some green noodle in a spicy sauce. So basically. This is crab. We also have crab at the table. And rice. So I think guys, the overall message here we may have enough food. Yeah. I don't think we're going to starve. I think so. I think we have enough. Don't think we'll starve today. And one more thing. They also gave us this. It is kind of like a cold broth with chunks of ice and a radish. Yeah, it is super refreshing. Mmmm. Yeah, maybe it is a palette cleanser. I'm not sure. But anyways let's go back to the meat. That is the star of the meal here. So it is now time for a complimentary dessert which is also quite refreshing. Yeah, we like polished that meat off big time. So it is so nice of them to bring over a Sikhye (식혜) which is basically like a basically like a sweet rice. It is a refreshing drink more or less with chunks of rice and some sugar added. It is really good. And this one is kind of slushy. Mmmm. It is like semi-frozen. I think it is perfect for summer. They made it perfectly for summer. They put a lot of ice in there. Oh man, this is really good. Really sweet. Really refreshing. Mmmm. Yeah. And one of the other cool things is that sometimes you'll find in Korean restaurants they'll have these like self-serve coffees. And man are they even good. Like I'm on a bit of diet these days, I'm not going to lie so I'm having black coffee but this has got. Black coffee or sweetened milk? This here has a lot of milk and sugar so this is like a dessert coffee for me. Okay. A little bit of a cheat here. Mmmm. Nice. So it is time to wrap up that meal. Tell us how did our Galbi (갈비) feast cost? You know what it is always a little bit of a sad occasion when a Korean barbecue ends because it is just so fabulous. So, that was fourteen thousand Won (원) each. So it came in total to twenty eight thousand Won (원). So ₩28,000 KRW. Which with current exchange is roughly about twenty five US dollars. So when you think about that twelve dollars and fifty cents for like all of this food. All of the meat. All of the side dishes. The drinks that you saw, even the dessert and a coffee. I mean to me that is phenomenal value. So when you're coming to Korea, especially to Seoul. Anywhere in Korea for that matter indulge in Korean barbecue. You won't be disappointed. New videos from South Korea every week! Click here! Alright so good morning from Seoul, South Korea. It is a bit of a lazy weekend today. A slow start. Sam was watching baseball so I've been waiting for him to be ready. Yeah, my team lost. The Cubs lost. Womp womp. I'm a little depressed. But anyways today we're kind of doing brunch so we're at Caffé Bene (카페베네) which is one of our favorite coffee chains and Cafe Bene (카페베네) is huge in Korea. Like a few years back they had close to a thousand branches spread out across the country so it is super popular. So yeah, we're here to have some drinks, some food and we'll be showing you that as soon as it arrives. So funny story. Originally we came here because we wanted to eat their gelato waffle because when we used to live in Korea that is what we'd get every single time. And their waffles are so good because they're all like caramelized and fluffy and they are just amazing. So we came, we placed our order and then we noticed like the buzzy thing. It was calling us back right away and we're like wow? That was fast. Too fast. But no I go downstairs and guy is like waffle impossible. So I guess I don't know they were out of dough or maybe something happened so we had to change up our order so I'll show you what we got instead. And I think it still looks good. It is not going to be gelato waffle but we're still getting one of their top specialties here which is their gelato. Nokcha (녹차)! And we're getting the green tea nokcha green tea (녹차) flavor. Yes. And what else do we have? And we have a hot cheese bagel with jalapeno. That looks pretty good. You can see the cheese oozing out. Yeah. And then this I'm pretty sure is a new product. I haven't seen it before on the menu. It said topping pastry. So we've got some kind of pastry here with whipped cream and chocolate powder. It is definitely big! Yeah. And a drink. Vanilla latte. Alright Sam what are you starting with? Ah, I'm going for the good stuff. Going for the green tea gelato. Oh la lah. Look at that. Oh man, that is so good. Such a rich rich green tea flavor. Alright, what is next. What are you going to get in to? How about your coffee? Why don't I try that. Vanilla latte. My vanilla latte. So let's rip off the top here. Try that. Take the lid off. Show us how frothy it is. Good point. Because otherwise you can't even see it. The viewers want to see. Frothy. Very frothy. How is that? That is a good latte. Yeah. Although it doesn't have that strong of a vanilla taste. But really creamy. Really good. Alright, so we're going to share the bagel. Cutting that in half. Oh yeah. Man, look at the cream cheese. Oh wow. Thickly stuffed. Totally oozing out. Woah. Totally oozing out. So this one in the middle it has cream cheese but they also put like I guess a regular mozza cheese and melted it on top of the cream cheese so it is like decadent. Look at how cheesy that is. I know. And you also see the chunks of jalapenos. Look at how thick that is. That might be. It is a behemoth. It is a behemoth. Mmmm. Is it good? Yeah. That is really nice. So how would you describe it? Super cheesy with a bit of a kick. So Sam is going to attack the topping pastry before it melts. Yeah, time to attack this big bad boy. So I think they put some whipping cream and cocoa powder on it. I'm not entirely sure. It is slowly losing its shape. Oh wow. Just from cutting it it kind of has the consistency of a cinnamon bun. So let's try that here. Mmmmm. Oh wow. Okay. Yep. That is definitely whipped cream. Yeah. With a bit of cocoa on top. And the pastry itself it looks like really big but it is actually really kind of light and fluffy. Yeah, very light and fluffy and it is perfect for putting this type of topping like a whipped cream on top of it because it is just adds a lot to it. Is there anything in the pastry? Does it have raisins. Um, let's investigate. Let's actually investigate that. I didn't get anything on my first bite. Investigative eating. I don't think so but it does have chocolate. It does appear to have chocolate on that. Chocolate is always a good thing. That is really good. Yeah. Nice and light. So what is your favorite thing so far that we've ordered? Well, I mean obviously the gelato but I haven't tried this one yet so. The bagel? No, the bagel is up next for me. Why don't I just take a bite right here. I'm going to take one of yours. Go for it. Just stealing yours. Mmmmm. Oh wow. I'm kind of glad you ordered something a little bit savory. It is spicy too. I'm feeling that spice. I keep saying that. Yeah. This is really pleasant. Sometimes it is good when you know like because they didn't have the waffles this is getting us out of our I wouldn't say our comfort zone but out of what we'd normally order. It forced us to try something new. It forced us to try some new things. We decided to make the video so we're rolling with it today. So we polished off all of that food. It was really good. The two items we liked the most were the jalapeno bagel with cream cheese and real cheese and also the green tea gelato. That was fantastic. So in terms of price point it came to just under twenty thousand Won (원). So I think it was actually was it nineteen thousand? Yep. So that is ₩19,000 KRW and roughly that is about sixteen or seventeen US dollars and not bad value. I mean we got three different food items and really large drink. So it is not super cheap but it is the kind of place that you want to come and relax and have a nice sweet treat basically. Yeah, so if you guys come and check out Cafe Bene (카페베네) make sure you get the waffle. Yes. Demand the waffle. Hahaha. Alright, that's a wrap from Seoul (서울). Tata. Alright, so it is time for another food video and today's is kind of breakfast slash lunch. Yeah. Brunch? Basically a brunch here in Seoul, Korea and we're having one of my favorites. We are having Korean porridge which is known as Juk (죽). And Juk (죽) is like this really kind of like it is considered to be a health food here in Korea. Yeah. And it is made out of like glutinous rice and different ingredients. I'm getting one made out of pumpkin and you're getting more of a savory one made out of shrimp and the cool thing is that there is a lot of health benefits associated with this food so it is the type of food you eat when you're sick or when you're having bad digestion and it is considered kind of a slow food. Kind of a get-well type of meal. So Sam are you having trouble with your digestion is that why we're here. No, that is not why we're here today. We're here just because it is tasty. Okay. The food is here. So I got the Saeyu Juk (새우 죽). So if you have a look here this is a shrimp porridge and it comes in a massive bowl first of all. I wonder if we're actually supposed to share because they gave us a tiny bowl with a ladle so you can kind of like just pour it for yourself. Yeah, you could definitely come here and order one of these to share but I mean we're hungry so we're going to try see if we can finish our own. And look at that. It is topped off with it looks like little sesame seeds and maybe some seaweed. So I'm just mixing it around. So yours is a bit different than mine. I think the chunks, like the chunks of rice that it has been made with appears to be thicker than mine. Yes. It is not as smashed or as glutinous as mine. Yeah. So mine is chunkier and mine also has carrots and chives so this looks great. Yeah, I was kind of craving something savory so I didn't order a sweet one like Sam. Yeah, so we have that contrast between the savory and sweet Juk which is cool. Different types of Korean porridge. Oh la la. This is steaming. It is like pipping hot. Ha! First bite. Mmmmm. Wow. You know what? It almost reminds me a bit of like a risotto but like a little bit more soupy. That is really nice. Yeah, I don't think you've ever had a savory Juk (죽) before. I think you've only tried the sweet ones. Yeah, and I wasn't a huge fan of the sweet ones. They were okay but I'm more of a savory person. So an instant hit? Yeah. This is really good. So do you taste the shrimp or like what are you tasting? Yeah, I mean it is just like a risotto. I mean you taste the rice. Like a savory rice that doesn't have a whole lot of spices but it is just it is nice. You taste the shrimp, you taste the vegetables. It is an instant hit. So Sam on the other hand he already knew what he wanted to order before we came here. Yeah, I'm getting my favorite Korean porridge and that is Dan Hobakjuk (호박죽). So basically that is Korean pumpkin porridge and if you take a look down here you can see that it is very orange. It is very pumpkin-y. And it has, it is made with the glutinous rice. Yeah. So that has been really smashed like thoroughly so you don't see the grains of the rice unlike yours. And I'm going to try to find. It also has these enormous giant rice balls. I don't know if you can see this. I think I actually grabbed three of them. You know what? It kind of looks like polenta at first glance. Yeah, it does kind of look like polenta. But it tastes very different. It tastes very differently. Okay, so I've served myself up. So I'm not going to go for a rice ball on the first bite. I'll just go for the I guess the Hobak part. The pumpkin part. So yeah, one thing it is very hot when it is served so you do want to really blow on it before you put it in your mouth. Mmmmm. Oh man, that is good. Yeah? Yeah? It is sweet but not too sugary. It has got just a very natural sweetness. Yeah. You can really taste the pumpkin. I mean sure it is made out of rice but the overwhelming taste is definitely the pumpkin. And yeah, it just is so smooth. You put it in your mouth and you don't even need to chew it just goes down nice and slowly. And you know what? Even though this is like a get-well food and you usually eat it when you're sick I think it is also just nice to eat it on a cooler day. Like a cool fall day when you just want something warm. It is a great late fall winter type of food because it is served pipping hot and it'll definitely warm you up. Alright, let's dig in. So our Juk (죽) also came with side dishes. We've got your kimchi (김치). A classic so I'm just going to add it to your porridge. Mix it in. And it also came with beef and this is kind of like a really fibrous meat that I really like so I'm also just going to mix that in and maybe some of this for spice. Wow, you're going all out here. Yeah. Just for an extra kick. I think it'll be nice. Because I mean this is quite plain. It is simple flavors so if you want to kind of spice it up you've got these little side dishes that you can just plop in. Mmmm. Magic! Hahaha. Okay, so I'm just looking at the menu here and I'm kind of thinking what I'd like to have next time we come back. And they have a whole lot of variety here. Yeah, show us that menu. Okay, so you can get the porridge with crab meat, with shrimp, they have bulgogi beef, you can get it with mushrooms if you're vegetarian. There is like black sesame, mung bean, red bean, pine nut, all kinds of seeds. So there is like tonnes of sweet and savory options. I know. And you know what? If you pay an extra 1000 Won, which is like less than a dollar, you get cheese. Hahaha. You can get cheese and like add it in and let it melt. Then it would be more like risotto. Hahaha. Oh my gosh we should have seen that earlier. Yeah! So do you feel healthy eating this? My health meter has moved up ten points. No, I'm just kidding that is really cheesy. But yeah, it is a healthy food and I have a memory like when I got sick when I used to work in Korea as an English teacher my director came in and brought me Juk (죽) as a kind of a get well. I guess kind of a gift or gesture as like oh you've got to have this Juk and it is going to make you feel better. Oh that is sweet. Yeah, it is a good memory that I have. So even though those bowls were massive we managed to finish everything. Both of them. And I didn't even help you. I'm shocked because you've become like a fan of Juk like just suddenly. That is kind of impressive. Alright, and let's talk about the cost. Alright, so the price point I've got the bill right here. So it was sixteen thousand Won. 16,000 W and that is roughly just over fourteen US dollars so you're looking at about seven dollars per person and throughout the menu you can order all of the different kinds of Juk more or less between seven thousand and nine thousand Won. So that is kind of the rough price point. Oh, I should point out too that we're eating at a place called BonJuk (본죽) which is a very popular Juk chain. You can find them all throughout Korea and I highly recommend coming to this place. This is like they really do an awesome Juk (죽). They do like an amazing Korean porridge. So if you're in Korea check out Bon Juk (본죽) and yeah we're stuffed it is time to go take a siesta. Bye! So as you can probably tell from those intense sweat stains on Sam we've had a pretty difficult day of sightseeing. Want to tell us about it? Yeah, so originally we planned to visit a Caffe Bene and we went there and it had shut down. So it was like oh gosh. That was annoying enough and then we walked like several more blocks looking, and this was a big thing we wanted to do today, we wanted to go to a parrot cafe. One of those quirky cafes you find only in Seoul (서울). And we go up there and it is closed. And I was like knocking on the door. Tuk tuk tuk. And all I could hear is like parrots squawking. Squawk, squawk. And a dog barking. It is going Woof, woof! Nobody around. So instead we've decided to have lunch. Yes. And we've ordered a little bit of booze. Yeah, we've got some Makgeolli (막걸리) and what we're focusing on today are Korean pancakes (전) also known as Korean pizza. And that is Jeon (전) so we are ordering Haemulpajeon (해물파전) which is seafood pajeon basically green onion Korean pancakes. And we're also ordering Kimchijeon (김치전) which is the kimchi pancakes or the basically the kimchi pizza. So we're just waiting for that to arrive and it is time to get boozy early in the morning. Eleven AM. Hahaha. So what is cool about South Korea is that there are a number of different alcohols that are matched to certain foods so when you're having chicken you typically have beer (맥주) and when you're having samgyeopsal (삼겹살) or some other type of Korean barbecue you typically have soju (소주) but when you're having Jeon (전) these Korean pancakes that we're having the preferred drink is Makgeolli (막걸리). And it is a kind of Korean rice wine that has a very milky consistency. If you take a look at it down here. It looks white. Yeah, it is. It is white and it kind of got it has got a bit of chunkiness to it. A little clumpy. It is clumpy. Yeah, that is how it is supposed to be. Okay. Have your first sip then. Ah, cheers! Yes, geonbae (건배). Cheers! Oh, it has been about four years since I've had this so yeah it is fantastic. The thing I really like about it right now is that it is chilled. So I mean it is a bit refreshing. But this is the kind of Korean alcohol that is a little bit sour in its taste and it just tastes wonderful at the moment I have to say. So the first Jeon (전) has arrived and this is the Kimchi Jeon (김치전) so let's have a look here. As you can see it is a flat pancake. It is a flour based pancake that has been fried in a pan with oil and it also has chunks of the gimchi (김치) which is the spicy fermented cabbage. So I'm going to take a little piece with my chopsticks. Oh, we have a dip here. So this is soy, vinegar and chili. And you can dip it in. Yeah, the dip goes so well with the jeon. You can't just eat it on its own. And it smells so good. Mmmmm. How is that Kimchijeon (김치전)? Mmmmm. It is really nice. It is like a savory pancake with lots of spice. It is really really good. Mmmm. So nice. I love this stuff. So another really neat thing about Korea is that certain foods are often paired with certain activities. And when you're hiking a mountain and/or if it is really rainy outside that is the perfect time to come for jeon. Guys like when you go with friends and you go have a jeon and you have a makgeoli. So it is pretty cool because it has been raining a lot in Seoul lately. But not today! Not today but I kind of feel like we're making up for those other rainy days. Alright, so I'm just going to dissect this here with my chopsticks. Look at you working those chopsticks. Yeah, look at that. And this one has a massive piece of kimchi. You can see the kimchi right there. So you know it is going to be good. So let's dip it in that sauce. Oh, wow. You know out of all of the jeon and I really like haemulpajeon. I still think I prefer kimchijeon to all of them. Like this is just it matches my taste perfectly. It is so nice because you get the spice from the kimchi but then the spice from the sauce as well. Exactly. First thing I want to point out here is just how much better I feel now that I've had a little bit of food and drink in my belly. Like my mood has improved significantly. I'm no longer a total curmudgeon. Anyways, now that I'm in a better mood I just remembered that with the makgeolli, I mean we're drinking it from the bottle. This is what you would find like say you go to a convenience store or grocery store. You would buy it in a bottle like this. But when you're having say a more traditional or homemade prepared Makgeolli (막걸리) it comes in a very special pot that is used to pour and so that is really cool. If you can have that that is definitely the most authentic way of having the alcohol. And also the way we were drinking it here. It is not out of cups. You drink it these little bowls. Yep. That is how you do it. That is how you roll with Makgeolli (막걸리). Good stuff. Now let's have you trying that. Okay. Mmmmm. You know I actually remember not liking this very much when I tried it a few years ago but it is not so bad. Like I find it very light and it is a little bit fizzy. Yeah. Normally you don't like alcohol. Yeah. It is almost like a girly sparkling wine. Hahaha. Sssshhh. You know what I think all of that wine drinking we did in South America has maybe rubbed off on you a bit. Yeah, it is good. And it compliments the Jeon (전) nicely because this is really spicy. So I kind of like the sweetness of this. You know, to soften the blow. So yeah, this is a good meal so far. A little bit more of that jeon. Yeah. Oh, before Sam steals it. This is my favorite one. Mmmmmhmmm. So now the second jeon has arrived. Yeah, the pancake. Like we demolished that kimchijeon guys. It is gone. That did not last long. Like I'm thinking less than two to three minutes. Hahaha. Alright, so let's take a look at the second star of the meal here. And that is the haemul pajeon and that is the seafood green onion pancake. And the haemul refers to the seafood so I'm going to find a piece of the seafood here so you can see. There is lots of octopus (문어). Lots of octopus. I think this actually might be squid. The ojing-eo (오징어). And so that is some of the haemul and the pa (파) the pa part is right here. And that is the green spring onion. The scallion. So that is a very good combination and we're really looking forward to trying this. Dig in. I'm just going to dig right in. Alright, the nice thing is that it kind of comes pre-sliced for you already into little squares but I'm going to just slice it up one more time so that I don't choke on it. Good idea. Good plan. Because the Pa, the green onions can kind of get stuck in your throat if you take too big of a bite. Yeah, they're quite chewy. So again, dip it into the sauce. Mmmmm. Yeah. That is really good. Mmmmm. So, again this one is savory. It is a savory pancake but it is not quite as spicy as the kimchi jeon but you have more ingredients like with the seafood and the green onion so it is a nice when you pair them together it is a really nice combination. Okay, so now it is time for me to try the seafood one. So I'm not the biggest fan of seafood so I'm just going for a little piece here. I always find seafood a little bit chewy but I'm braving it for the video. There you go. Some kind of sea creature in there. Hahahaha. Yeah. Okay. Mmmmm. You're right it is not as spicy as the other one. I think you prefer the kimchijeon. Right? I do but you know what it is not bad. It is growing on you. It is not bad. I could eat this. Growing on you like the makgeollli. Right? Hahahaha. Yeah. And the seafood isn't as chewy as I was expecting so that is very good thing. Well, I would say that was a very delicious meal. There is nothing left. We took care of that with authority guys. Absolutely demolished that. Once again. Okay so let's talk about the price for the whole meal. Yeah, in terms of the price so the haemul pajeon was ten thousand won (원). ₩10,000. And the kimchi jeon. The kimchi pancake was eight thousand won. Ah, ₩8000. So basically in total you're looking at like sixteen US dollars. So about eight per person to have that glorious pancake feast. And ah, definitely if you're in Seoul or anywhere in Korea you've got to try this. This is probably one of my personal favorite foods in Korea. So I highly recommend it. New videos from South Korea every week! Click here! So Seoul (서울) has some pretty unusual cafes and today we're going to be documenting one of those. We're heading to 또옹카페 which is basically a poo cafe. Hahaha. Yes. This isn't a cat cafe it is not a dog cafe. It is a cafe dedicated to poop in all of its shapes and forms. So we're going to show you what that looks like. It sounds right up our alley. Yeah. So we've found the cafe. It is kind of hard to miss with the big swirls of pooh but there it is. Let's go. What are you wearing? It is my new cap. I mean, come on it just looks like all of the other ones I've bought. We are wearing poo hats. And my poop just fell off of my head. Hahaha. This one is a little green. Maybe I had McDonald's last night. So Sam you taught here in Korea for a few years tell us a bit about the fascination with poop. Well there really is a bit of a quirky fascination with poo in Korea and it is hilarious. I remember one of the funniest assignments I did with my students was I basically gave them a blank comic book strip and they had to create their own comic using English. And this one kid created basically it was a catastrophe related to pooh. I guy went up to the top of a building. He took a crap it landed on the street caused a big accident and then there was a news agency coming out to report the incident so. Wow. Yeah, that was a very very sophisticated poop story. I have to say. I think I gave him an A for that one. Our order has arrived. Tell us a little bit about what we got. Well, take a look at this thing of beauty here. This is my French Vanilla cafe. Oh la lah. And you can see the intricate art design there. And down below again this would be my dung waffle. This is basically a dung shaped waffle covered with poo sauce on top. With poop sauce. Maybe chocolate. I hope it is chocolate or nutella. It is 50-50 with a banana. We haven't quite ascertained what it is. And you know what? The plate is pretty cool. This is basically a latrine or like a squat toilet. Look at that. Oh yeah, they've got this down here at this cafe. So we're eating out of the toilet. Sounds about right. Oh, and you know what? What? If you come here at lunchtime and you order pasta or something like that they serve it in a toilet bowl. Why didn't we get that? It's too early in the day I suppose. We were here for breakfast. We're the first customers inside. So I bet this is your first time trying a poop waffle. I think it might be. I think it might be. Mmmmm. Dung-a-licious. Oh no no no. Pooptastic! Pootastic. No, that is a chocolate or Nutella sauce. It is really good. We hope. We hope. So what are you having to drink? So I ordered a mango lassi. And it is actually really good. It almost tastes like the ones I was having in India when I was traveling there. So that is a really good compliment. Authentic huh? Yeah. Authentic. Nice and thick. Yes. Stop distracting me. The waffle is slowly disappearing so I'm going to dig in while I still have a chance. Oh, you're going to get a little bit of banana. It is like caramelized on top. There we go. Dung-y goodness. Poo waffle. Let's get that chocolate. So poop waffle reaction? You know what it is really good. I can recommend this place. Come check out the poop cafe guys. When in Seoul, why not? Okay, so we finished that fantastic meal. That poop inspired meal. Hahaha. So what was the damage? Alright, let's access the damage. So as you see down here it is eighteen thousand Won. ₩18,000 which as of today is sixteen US dollars. So I mean it was a little bit pricey but why are on Insadong (인사동) street which is very touristy area of Seoul. And I thought the quality of the food and the drinks was fantastic. Also plus you're paying for the experience. You really are. Where else are you going to go to a poo cafe guys? So yeah, I do recommend coming and yeah it was a very unique experience. That is for sure. Gamsahamnida (감사 합니다). So we are going for something called Dong Bang (동빵). Which is basically a poop shaped pancake. Poo shaped bread pancake. It is really hot so I wonder if it is going to be chocolate or red bean paste. I still can't tell but it is burning my mouth. Mmmmm. Okay. So that is a poop shaped pancake filled with chocolate. Freshly made. Yummy? Mmmmhmmm. We just had to have it after eating at the poop cafe, you know? It was mandatory.

This is a steakhouse. It is a Parrilla. That means they cook all of their meat on the grill. And it is seriously the best meat we've tried in the city. And we've ordered our favorite cut - Bife de Lomo. It is going to be amazing. We're waiting for that to show up. So it wouldn't be a proper meal without a little bit of Vino Tinto. Yes, this is the house wine and it is actually very good for house wine. So anyways, what makes this our favorite restaurant in Buenos Aires. Well, you know traditional Argentine food is steak. And it is called Parrilla or Asado. And what we're having here is parrilla. It is a special cut of meat. And what I really love about this restaurant, why we really like this place so much, is that the food is just fantastic here. There are some steakhouses in Argentina which are kind of a little bit pretentious. You're paying a bit more for the atmosphere than you are for the food. But this place is all about the food. It is just such an incredible cut of meat. I can't wait to share it with you. So another think we like about this place are the appetizers. We didn't order these. But every-time we come here they give us empanadas. And look at these. They're nice and golden. These are special. They are some of the juiciest empanadas. Mmmmm. Look at that. It is like lean ground beef and it is really juicy and really flavorful. And these are fried empanadas so a little bit greasy as well. Which I do enjoy. And if that wasn't enough check out the bread basket we were given. Some of these slices of bread actually have cheese melted on top. And bacon. Look at this one. Cheese and bacon. I'm claiming that one. So until the meat gets here we've ordered an ensalada completa. Yes, this is our complete salad. An oh it comes with a lot of ingredients. My favorite being the beetroot. Yes. Check out this generous slab of beetroot. It has tomatoes, egg. There is even a potato here. Onions, potatoes. Shredded carrot. Yeah. This is an awesome salad. It makes us feel a little better about all of the meat consumption. Yeah. And this is the reason we came here. The star of the meal has arrived. The star of the meal. Bife de lomo. Look at this piece of beauty on my fork. Oooh. That is some of the most tender meat I've ever had in my entire life. You bite into it and it just disintegrates, it just melts right into your mouth. And it is so juicy and flavorful. It is just fantastic. This is the tenderloin in English. It is the best. And you know what makes this restaurant awesome. You know how you can tell you're in a really good steakhouse. They don't ask you how you want your steak. They don't say do you want it rare, do you want it medium rare, do you want it well done? No, they just make it the house way and they know what they're doing. So you get the best most optimal steak possible. So it is now my turn. And I like to put Chimichurri on my steak. So it is kind of like this sauce. Um, and it has garlic and different spices. I don't actually know all of the ingredients. I just know I can always taste garlic. Loads of garlic. Spread it on. It looks like it has some kind of a oil base as well. Yeah. And then over here you also have another kind of salsa. Yeah, so this one is not spicy. This would be mild. But I like the one with a kick. So. Chimichurri. Let's put more chimichurri on. Mmmmm. That is my favorite. It is the best cut of meat you can get at this restaurant. And you do have to pay a little bit more for it but it is totally worth it. And we ordered one portion and it is enough for Sam and I to share. Like that is one big cut of meat if you saw it. But yeah, highly recommended. If you want to try some good steak Parrilla Peña in the neighborhood of Recoleta. Or just south of Recoleta actually. It is really good. Track it down. Okay, so Sam what do you think sets Argentinian steak apart from steak in any other country. Well, Argentine steak has a reputation for being world class. It is considered one of the best steaks in the world and you know what I totally agree with that. What really sets it apart is they don't try to mask the steak with tonnes of barbecue sauce. Like if you look down here you can see. I don't know if you can see this but there is just a little bit of salt on top. What the real focus is is on grilling. Grilling it to perfection. Using the right temperature, cooking it for the right amount of time so it is a little bit crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. They have just got that down to perfection. Argentine steak is just world class. There is no other way to describe it. Yeah, take that Brazil. Someone has a little bit of my wine. I think she's still doing just fine. But we have a little bit of dessert so how about we introduce our dessert. What do we got here? Okay, so I'm already full. I didn't even want dessert but Sam insisted. So we are having Queso con dulce de batata. So that is cheese with a sweet potato type of dessert. And we also ordered a portion of dulce de leche. Just there is nothing else in there aside from dulce de leche. And that is more or less or most favorite thing in the world. Like if I was on a stranded island, on a deserted island and I could have like one request I might ask for dulce de leche. A jar of dulce de leche. And how is that? It's good, I mean I think it is better when you're having it with ice cream or a banana or some cake but I mean it is not bad on its own. So how would you describe it for someone who has never tried it before? It is kind of similar to caramel but not quite. I find it a lot creamier, a lot richer, milkier. It is. It is basically made by boiling condensed milk and like you just keep boiling it and stirring it until it gets thicker and thicker. And this is what you end up with. Okay, so this is probably the simplest dessert you can get in Argentina. It is known as the trucker's meal. This is what a trucker would order at like a pit-stop. You know just a very simple basic dessert. You know what this is a really classy dessert for what is considered a trucker's dessert. I mean it looks really delicious and my first time I ever tried this was at your house. Your parent's house I should say like two or three years ago. So I'm familiar with this dessert. It is one of my favorites. It is simple but it is delicious. So let's try that. Mmmm. So what is great about this is this is a really like tasty cheese but when you add it with this sweet potato it is sort of like in a gelatin form. In a thick form. It just gives it that extra bit of sweetness while you're eating the cheese. And it is incredible. It is simple but it is good isn't it? Simple but delicious. So it would appear Sam is on cloud nine at the moment. So here is a guide to eating dulce de leche. You just grab a big spoon like this, stick it in your mouth and you let it sit there for about 30 seconds and you close your eyes. There are not too many feelings in the world that are better than this. Hahahaha. Oh my gosh. Have you found Nirvana over there? I'm pretty close. Maybe you just need another spoon. Okay. I think this is the result of too much wine. Okay, so we've been stuffing ourselves for close to an hour. It is time to go home. So let's do price point. Okay, so in terms of price point we're going to focus on which is basically the nicest cut of meat in the house. That entire cut of meat was 270 Pesos which was about $18 US dollars. And that was for both of us. So when you think about that kind of value you're getting $9 per person and you're eating like some of the best steak of your entire life. So incredible value and again this is just the kind of place. Like I can't recommend it enough. I would call it a neighborhood parrilla. A neighborhood steakhouse. It is the kind of place that you go into and you see mostly locals are eating at. And when you see locals eating at a restaurant like this you know it is high quality because they are going to demand it. They're not going to come back if the food is not good. You can rip off a tourist but you're not going to rip off a local. And that is all I've got to say. Come here. Goodbye. So today's video is all about breakfast and the plan is to show you an Argentinian breakfast. Or a desayunar. Now we wanted to go to a really nice cafe that is near the Recoleta Cemetery; however, it is pouring rain outside so we just ran out of our apartment and found the nearest cafe and popped in. So we've placed our order, we are hungry and yeah we're going to be showing you what breakfast looks like in this part of the world. So Sam our breakfast has arrived. Breakfast has arrived. I am a very happy boy. Well, the cool thing about breakfast in Argentina is that they like to keep it simple and sweet. And that makes it one of my favorite meals here. So I'm pretty happy with what I ordered. I got Café con leche which is coffee with milk. The milk is super frothy by the way. Check that out. I'm not even a coffee drinker. I normally go for tea but when in Argentina you've got to do it right. You've got to get some coffee. And then over here I have my medialuna. Which is like a croissant. This one is made with butter and I have facturas which are little pastries. So this one is made with crema pastelera which is kind of like a yellow cream similar to Boston Cream. And this one is stuffed with quince jam. So super excited about that. This is going to be a good breakfast and I'm just going to dig right in. I'm not waiting for you. Ha! Mmmm. So, I bit most of the jam out but if you have a look inside. It is like a little croissant roll. A butter roll stuffed with quince jam which is so good. Mmmhmmm. So Sam can you tell us what you ordered for breakfast. I sure can. So if you take a look down here I'm having something called tostadas which essentially is toast. Yes. It is a massive generous portion. It's a lot of toast. 6 slices. Yeah, I was thinking maybe like two slices but I've got six. And what I'm most excited about here is this is like a whipped butter and it looks amazing. So I'm just going to pour it, not pour it, spread it all over and then take a bit of the jam. I wonder what kind of jam it is. It looks like it may be cherry jam actually. Cherry or a dark raspberry. So getting that ready. Let's see how good this toast is. Wow. That is some mighty fine toast. Starting the day with sugar. Oh, yeah. So another cool thing that I haven't noticed anywhere else in the world is that when you order a coffee and something sweet here, like a croissant or a pastry or a piece of cake you get a little glass with fizzy water. This is called agua con gas. Soda water. Soda water. Actually, this one isn't fizzy. This is like the first time this has happened. It is usually fizzy and it is really nice to just like cleanse your palette and move on to the next flavor. You need it with all of the sugar that you have. This is a first. Non-fizzy water. I'm shocked. And beverage of choice this morning? Yeah, and for me the best part about Argentine breakfast is the coffee. The quality of the coffee is superb. And I ordered one with con leche. Cafe con leche which means a generous portion of milk and wow is it ever good. I usually put in one pack of sugar, stir it around and it is like perfection. It is magic. Perfection in a cup. Have a sip. I could have this any time of day. Not just for breakfast. And breakfast also came with orange juice today. It did. How is that? Is it from concentrate? Or freshly squeezed? You know what, it actually tastes freshly squeezed but the pulp has been removed. So good quality orange juice too. We are going to be on some kind of a sugar high by the time we're done all of this food and drink. And now for one final treat. Another thing we've noticed is that in some of the nicer cafes they give you free sweets, so even though we ordered like a coffee with like a croissant and the pastries you still get a little something extra. And Sam has already claimed one of these. Yes, I get the one on the bottom. So this one is like a little cake with dulce de leche and I think it may be coconut on the top. Just let me do a taste test here. Mmmm, okay yeah wow. So the top layer is all shredded coconut and then you have dulce de leche and like a little tart base. And this is the one that Sam really wants. Mini alfajor with dulce de leche and coconut all around. And I'm going to. That's evil! I won't do that. It's yours. It is all yours. Would you say this is your favorite sweet treat in South America? Yeah, it is kind of scary how much I like this. I think I'm getting addicted over here. Yeah, it is kind of scary how often you eat them. Well, you better savor that bite because it is a tiny one. Hahaha. Well, as you as you can see we had no trouble devouring that. Yeah, we polished that all off. It is time for price point. Yes, so basically it was 60 pesos per person which right now is between 4 to 5 US dollars. And in some cheaper cafes you can get it for like three but this one is like a really nice quality meal. And they're really generous with the portions and the quality of the food was good so excellent value I'd say. So you're satisfied? Very much. I may need a siesta after breakfast. A morning siesta. #eatArgentina So one of the experiences that has been recommended time and time again is to go and have lunch at a Bodegón. And that is kind of like an old fashioned tavern. It has a very family oriented feel. And it is kind of simple, classic. You know the focus is on good food and large hearty portions. So that is what we're doing right now. We're eating at a place called Norte. Restaurante Norte. We've just placed our order and the food should be arriving soon. So what I've noticed right away is that it appears we're the only tourists here. It looks like this is a very kind of like neighborhood type of establishment and there is a lot of locals frequenting this place. Which is really cool. I think like there is a lot of times where we go out and we know we're eating somewhere really touristy and it just doesn't feel quite as authentic as this. And also this place is open pretty much throughout the whole day. We noticed they have breakfast specials, you can pop in for lunch which is what we're doing right now or you can come in for a late night dinner. Yeah, they are open from six in the morning until midnight. So Sam you're looking happy over there. Why is that? Yes, my bife de lomo al champignon has arrived. Which is basically steak with mushrooms and I think kind of a gravy and these look like homemade wedges like home fries. Oh, look at the gravy. Look at all of the gravy. It is swimming in gravy. So I'm going to try the meat. I've served myself up a little portion. I'm going to make sure I've got lots of gravy and a potato at the same time. Oh man, I'm so excited for this. Wow! Wow, he says. Wow! That is some tender meat. And I've never had this kind of steak with gravy before. And it is like having like Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner except with steak instead of turkey. And the steak is a lot better than any turkey I've ever had. This is amazing. So I ordered the mini Bife de Chorizo with french fries. And as you can see there is nothing mini about that hunk of meat. I thought it was going to be at least half the size. Maybe it is min if you're a ten foot tall giant that weighs over 500 kilograms. Yeah, seriously. But if you're kind of a normal mortal human there is nothing mini about that. It is massive. I think we're going to have to share this and maybe even take some of it back home. Oh, look at that meat. It looks so good. Tender. It does have some hunks of fat in there. Urgh. Anyways I'm struggling here. It is too big to maneuver. Ah man, how do I do this? Cut, cut. So we finally transferred this over to your plate. Now take your first bite. Cut that steak up. It is so much meat. So it is a little bit rare. A little pink and juicy which I don't mind. I can handle a little bit of blood. That is how it is supposed to be done. Yeah. You know what. That's good. That's good. I was expecting not to like it so much after trying Sam's because his was really amazing. He had Bife de Lomo which is super tender. But this is actually quite soft as well. It is a different cut of meat. This one is a little bit cheaper also than what Sam had. So there is a bit more fat in there. But it is actually pretty good. Yeah. So as Sam would say this place is hopping. This place is hopping and you know what time. It is 12:40 right now. Which is way before peak lunchtime in Argentina. Normally when we've gone out to film our food videos we've intentionally come at like exceptionally early. Like 12 o'clock when we arrived is really early for here. And we've done that just so we can get a table. But this place is almost entirely packed and it is not even peak time until probably 2PM. Yeah, and we're seeing lots of businessmen and they're getting their food really fast so I think they've liked called in advance and ordered their meal. Yeah, and we're loving our steak here but we've also noticed that the pasta looks fantastic. We've seen like some giant meatballs that are like this big. Yeah, seriously you need to come back and try them. Like they're bigger than my face almost. Almost. Almost. Maybe not quite. So Sam is scowling over there on the other side of the table because apparently I had one too many fries. You were being little miss greedy guts. You had about 10 or 15 bites of my fries while I was eating steak. So I had to like draw the line right here. This is yours, that is mine. I'm allowed to have a few more and then that's it. I barely have any left. Grrr. So I have no idea what we're doing. We're already stuffed but yet we've somehow found room for dessert. We had to get dessert. So this is called Flan con dulce de leche. And that looks amazing. Oh my! And like look at all of the juice down here. That caramelized sugar. Oh my! Mmmmm. Wow. I almost feel like we should have each gotten our own. Because I'm going to have trouble sharing. So Sam is counting the moolah. We're going to pay up and then. So in terms of price point that was 468 Pesos which is roughly just over thirty US dollars. And that included wine, that included two massive orders of steak and a dessert. Oh and also soda water too. And table service. So that was like incredible value. I'm sure you could come here and order cheaper things. We noticed a lot of people ordering this kind of pasta with these giant meatballs. So there is value here to be had. The food is excellent. It is not pretentious. You just come here to eat a big filling meal. And I'm so stuffed I'm probably going to have a three hour siesta after this. Check out all the pizzas we can choose from. I think we have to order the specialty for sure. Another day, another slice of pizza. Today we're at Pizzería Güerrin, one of the most famous pizzerias in all of Buenos Aires. This is one of Sam's favorite spots in the whole city and we're here for lunch. We've placed our order and we're waiting for the pizza to arrive. Excited to be here? Oh, yeah. This place is an institution. It has been open since 1932 and just as of last year they sold their 25th million pizza. Can you believe that? 25 million pizzas. That is a lot of pizza. That is insane. And this place is kind of special for me because my first time in Buenos Aires was actually back in 2010. And I was an ultra hardcore backpacker at the time and I stumbled upon this place through a recommendation and I came here very frequently. So this place has a lot of sentimental value and it is great to be back here again. So the pizza has arrived and we have to start with the specialty of the house. It is called pizza Güerrin. So that is this slice over here. Look at that. Oh, my goodness. The toppings are falling off. Wow, that has got a lot going on. Cheese. I see olives. What else is there? It is a really thick crust first of all. The tomato sauce is kind of unusual. It is really chunky and you have mozzarella cheese, slices of ham, red peppers and olives. So that is like fully loaded in my eyes. So let's dig right in. Look at me. Using a fork and a knife to cut my pizza. How sophisticated. Fancy. It's hot. Oh, man. Mmmmm. Oh, wow. Ooey gooey goodness? And it is a little bit greasy with all of the cheese. That is some really thick cheese they have. So it is really nice but let me actually get some pepper in there. So I can tell you if it is good or not. That is nice. Wow. You're going to have to try it and give me your opinion. The pizza master. So I'm being a nice wife and I'm sharing my pizza slices with Sam. This is the specialty of the house. Yeah, how nice of you to share. I will accept your offer. Yeah, it is quite rare for me to share isn't it? It really is. It is very rare. Mmmmm. Magic. That's magic in the mouth. An explosion of flavors. Yeah, I love. I mean this is a really good slice of pizza especially because you've got a lot of different ingredients going on but it still has a classic trademark of having really good sauce and copious amounts of cheese. Which is the reason why I love this place so much. So next up is Fugazetta. And Fugazetta is normally onions but this Fugazetta with ham and cheese. Look at all of the onions on here. And you can see the ham right there. That is awesome. Mmmm. Wow. You know what if you think the first slice of pizza had a lot of cheese this one has I would swear like double or triple. Like it is just overloaded with cheese. And for someone who likes cheese as much as me that is a very good thing. Okay, so this is a bit unusual. This is called fainá. And I always see people eating it when they order pizza but like it is not actually a slice of pizza. I asked the waiter what it was made of and I think he said chickpeas but I can't remember though. It was a while ago. Um, so yeah it is kind of like a paste and it has been shaped to look like a pizza, and they slice it into little triangles. This is what it looks like. Can you see? Yeah. So yeah, I don't know. It is kind of like a side order when you order pizza. It's cheaper than the pizza slices? It is. It is so much cheaper and this is my first time seeing it anywhere in the world. So I don't know, maybe it is some kind of Argentinian invention. I'm not sure. If you've ever tried fainá before let me know about it. Yeah, we kind of ordered that on a whim. Yeah. But I like it. I do like it. And last but certainly not least - Napoletana. And this is probably my favorite kind of like classic kind of pizza slice. Mine too. So you have to share. Yes. Well, we'll think about that. Oh wow, the tomato just dropped off. Let's grab that back. So what really makes this like one of my favorite slices is the fact that it has these big thickly cut juicy tomatoes put on top. And that just makes it like extra juicy. That is the same reason why I like Napoletana. Mmmm. Oh, yeah. Let's take one more look at that slice. It just looks so good. And look at the oregano sprinkled on top. Fresh tomatoes. That is going to be a tough one to share. Okay, so Sam, now it is time for the tough question. You've eaten in two of Buenos Aires' pizzerias - El Cuartito and now Pizza Guerrin, which one is your favorite of the two? You know what that is like choosing your favorite child. That is just impossible. It is like 1A and 1B. These are two of the best pizza places in the city. But not just in the city but anywhere I've had pizza in the world. So if you're coming to Buenos Aires you've got to go to both of them. And you're going to find they're quite similar. They're really big thick slices of pizza. Quite affordable, lots of cheese. The toppings that they put on are all high quality. Like when they slice that tomato and put it on there it is big thick juicy pieces. So come to Buenos Aires, try them both, I don't have a favorite. Maybe this one has a little bit more sentimental value because I came here before but you know what they're both great. That is a very diplomatic answer. So we've paid the bill. It is now time for price point. How much did these slices of pizza cost? So in terms of the slices it is between 19 and 27 Pesos. So at current exchange rate with the US dollar you're looking at about say between $1.35 all the way up to $1.90. So really affordable. Come here with a big appetite and order as many slices as you can because this is the kind of place where you're going to want to walk out full. Yes, follow Sam's example. So this afternoon Sam ran out of the apartment and said 'Oh I'm just going to get something sweet.' And then he came back with all of this. Check it out. So these are Artesanales Alfajores and we decided these are two beautiful to eat right away. Let's do a taste test! So that is exactly what this video is going to be. I can't wait to dig in. So these right here are Artesanales de maizena which means they are made with cornstarch which is a finer flour than you know your regular baking flour. Um, so yeah, I'm just going to dig right in. I've got a knife so that I can share with Sam. Yes, share is caring. Or battle him if he gets too close. Okay, I'm going to start. I guess I should start with the classic one. This is a familiar alfajor that we've seen in lots of different bakeries. Look at how much dulce de leche is in there. Check that out. Look at the thickness of that. That is probably like a centimeter of dulce de leche. And it has got coconut on the exterior. Shredded coconut, it is kind of yellow, it looks great. It's just one bite. It is almost like a timbit. You know, timbits donuts. Yes. Do it in one bite. Mmmmm. Wow! That's a lot of dulce de leche in my mouth right now. So it is like womp womp. Getting stuck to my palette. But, wow, really good. Really sweet. And the dough is kind of crumbling. Like it just falls apart the minute you stick it in your mouth. Mmmm. Alright, this is my first one to try here. Ooh. That looks good. A huge amount of dulce de leche. And this one appears to maybe have like coconut on the outer rim and this is kind of I think it might be icing sugar. Those are just scrumptuous. They're just divine. Divine. Magic. And that is icing sugar. Yeah, it is like you know like even store bought alfajores are tasty but when you get them done like from these Artesanal bakeries it is just taking the game up to like beyond the roof. This is insane. Through the ceiling. Through the ceiling! We just burst through the ceiling. Okay, so this next one here, as you can see, has a dulce de leche filing. And then chopped almonds coating the exterior and a little bit of icing sugar on top. So let's cut it in half. Because sharing is caring. Yeah, the knife wars haven't started yet. Wow. Oh la lah. One bite. Mmmmm. I really like having the almond there. It mixes in nicely with the dulce de leche. It just tastes sophisticated if that is possible. Really good one. I think I like this one more than the first one you tried. Alright, time for me to try this one. I think it has chocolate. Oh, neat. Okay, so it is just a chocolate covering. It still has the dulce de leche in the middle. Let's try that. Is that milk chocolate or dark chocolate? That is dark chocolate. Oh, I wouldn't have liked that one so it is a good thing you got it. I do like this one but I prefer the first one. Yeah. For the same reasons. I like icing sugar a little bit more than dark chocolate. And we still have one more. So let's cut into that. Oh la la. Alright, so again dulce de leche filling but this one has a glaze over top. And it breaks apart. Mmmm. It tastes like wedding cake. And I love wedding cake. Good quality wedding cake. Yeah. Seriously, if you have a wedding coming up you should have these instead of cake. And last but not least. This one here may end up being my favorite. Oh, no. You just destroyed it. I just destroyed it. How are we going to share. Oh my gosh. Well, you've still got half of it. It is just smushed. It was such a hard thing to cut here. So, this one appears a coating on it. It looks glazed. That looks just like the one that I tired. I think you got two of the same by accident. It is glazed. And it is I think exactly the same one. But this is my favorite one. Mine too. Yeah, totally if I had to recommend one out of these six definitely get this one. Good thing we got two of them. So we are now moving on to these fancier giant-sized alfajores. Yeah, time for the big boys. Time to bring out the big boys. And this one, out of the four big ones we got, is the heaviest by far. It is like a brick. It actually weighs a lot in my hand. I can like you know do a workout here with it. Hahaha. And I think it is made with crackers. If you can see here. It is kind of a different type of pastry. It has got a massive amount of glaze, glazing all over it. Let's just dig right in here. Big bite. Woah. Check out all of the layers. How many layers? Oh man, it is like the mini one, it is like the wedding cake one, except you're getting all of these different layers. So, this one is incredible. Time for you to try your first big one. And this one is pink. And look, I want to show you the bottom of it because it is a different type of dough. It is not like the cracker one that Sam was trying. So yeah, it should be interesting. And it is pink. It is so cute. Mmmmm. Surprise, surprise. This is the first one that doesn't have a dulce de leche filling. What is in it? That right there is dulce de membrillo which is a quince jam. Not a popular food in North America. I've only ever had it here in Argentina as a jam or like different pastries. And yeah, it works really well with the strawberry glaze. Look at that. Mmmmm. So this one right here is another behemoth. Yes, check it out. For my last one I'm trying what might the thickest one. Like look at this. And it only has two cookies and the rest of this appears to be glaze with maybe dulce de leche underneath. That is like an inch of dulce de leche. That is like a week's worth of sugar. Look at that. Look at that. You know what. New favorite one. This is my new favorite one. This beats the wedding cake one. There is so much dulce de leche and then all of that icing sugar. Oh, yeah. This is the best one. Right here. Winner, winner. Ding, ding ding. Winner. Winner. So this is the last one I'm trying. And it looks quite similar to the one with the pink glaze. Similar type of cookie as well. So we'll see. Mmmmm. Okay, so again, dulce de leche filing. And I honestly expected it to have a different type of glaze. Maybe lemon or you know something unusual. But it is just your standard glaze. It tastes like sugar. And I'm not complaining because I really enjoy glazed pastries so this is a pretty good one. So now that we've devoured all those delicious alfajores it is time to talk about price point. Yeah, so in total it came to 130 Pesos which is right in between 10 Canadian and 10 US dollars right now. Yeah, and that was for the 4 large one. The 4 large alfajores. Yeah, the 4 large ones and 6 little ones. And we got it from here. La Pasta Frola. So this is on Avenida Corrientes. It is and it has existed since 1917. So 99 years old. Next year it'll be a hundred. Big anniversary coming up. It is lunchtime. Our favorite time of day. Today we're eating at a place called La Americana. And the slogan is La Reina de las Empanadas. The queen of the empanadas, so that is exactly what we're going to be trying. We've ordered a sampler plate with five different ones and that should be coming really soon. So La Americana, the name of this restaurant, is actually a little bit of a misnomer because they specialize in more like traditional hearty types of fare. Yeah, like pizza and empanadas. You won't be finding hot dogs or hamburgers. No, nothing like that. No, it is not American. And this is one of these cool longstanding restaurants that is located on Avenida Corrientes. Yeah, the theatre district area. What is that fancy little thing you've got over there. Alright, so this is pretty cool. It is called soda sifon. And it is basically soda water and I guess they just prepare it here. Honestly, I don't know the technicalities. I don't know how you make soda water. Well, that is obviously the device that makes it work. But yeah, so then you just go like this. Oh, it is leaking. You've got soda. I do have soda. La la la. Look at those bubbles. Isn't that cool. Salut! Isn't it bad luck to toast with just water? Probably is. It tastes like soda water. They have arrived. Yes, and I think we may have ordered one too many because these are massive. Two or three too many. These are gigantic. They're a lot bigger than what we were expecting so I think we'll have some leftovers for dinner or maybe a quick snack. Um, but anyway let's dig right in. I'm going to start with this one right here. This one is called Cuyanita. It is a meat empanada that has been deep-fried. So let's just cut into it first so you can see the filling. There we go. It is steaming. So you can see the beef there, there is a green olive and also a bit of egg. I'm going to have to wait for this to cool down. I think it is fresh out of the deep fryer to be honest. It is burning my fingers. Blow on your food. Mmmmm. Oh, oh my gosh. That is one of the best ones I've had in the country. I kid you not. But have a look. The meat is kind of juicy. It is really nice and also the dough is made with lard. So you kind of get like a salty greasiness coming through which probably isn't healthy but it tastes amazing. And which one are you trying next? I'm trying Criolla which is also a meat one but apparently this one is baked as opposed to fried. So let's dissect that here. Oh, look you can see the juices. The juices are coming out. Oh, wow. Wow! Wow. Oh, wow! You know what I don't even know I can really hold it. Oh, that has got a green olive in it as well. You can see it steaming. Look at that. Oh, baby. Let's try that. So you also had a bit of mine which was deep-fried. So you'll have to compare the two. You know what, there is one common element between the two of them and that is that there is so much awesome juicy ingredients inside. Like, these are some of the best empanadas we've had in South America not just in Buenos Aires. They're so juicy and so flavorful. Honestly, the only difference really between the fried and the baked one is just how the dough tastes on the outside. The fried one is a bit more crispier whereas this one has more of that typical baked type of texture. So next up I'm going to try one that is called Pastel de Choclo which technically isn't an empanada. It is round and it looks more like a pastry. But I mean, it kind of looks like a fancy Danish or something. But it was listed on the menu next to all of the empanadas so we figured why not. Let's just add it in. Oh, look at all of the corn. Oh, yeah wow. Look at that. Yeah, oh my. So this one is a lot flakier if you can see the dough it has lots of layers. It is like Mille-feuille. Um, and yeah you can see the corn right there. It is very buttery. You can feel it. Let's take a big bite. To me it looks like a cross between a Danish and a Croissant. A stuffed Danish. Mmmmm. You know what it has icing sugar on top. So it is an interesting combination because it is kind of savory. Like I wouldn't say the dough is super salty but it is kind of savory with the corn. And then you add a bit of sugar on top. It is interesting. I've never had anything like this. It is like a crossover pastry. Mmmmm. Unusual. But I'm glad I tried it. It is time for another. Which one are you having next? Yes, I am having the tuna one. The atún one. And much like the one you just tried this one has a texture more or like a pastry or a croissant. Yeah. And so very flaky. But you can see there is a generous amount of tuna here. Let's see. Mmmm. Yum. Alright, let's try that. Mmmmm. Yeah. That's really good. I haven't had a lot of empanadas with tuna before so this is a pretty unique flavor. And it just it is kind of strange having a tuna pastry that is more like a like a croissant than a typical empanda. Yeah, but it goes well. I mean there is also a little bit of a sugary taste on this one too. But it is overwhelmingly savory though. I noticed it had a bit of icing sugar. Good stuff. Well, well was that a good choice for lunch? Yeah, that was an awesome surprise. I mean, we though the empanadas would be good here but we didn't know how good they'd be. They were spectacular. And they're very affordable too. Between 19 to 26 Pesos. So that is not a lot of money at all. I mean, you're looking at less than $2 US dollars between 1 to 2 US dollars about 1.50 to 2.00 US dollars. It is really good value. So yeah, come check it out. La Americana on Avenida Corrientes. Yes. Well hello from Buenos Aires! It is lunchtime in the city and today we have a very special meal planned for you. And for us because we're going to be eating it. We're going to a place called El Club de la Milanesa and they specialize in Milanesas. And we're been there once before, we loved it, we knew we had to go back and make a video. So let's get going. Well, we are here. This restaurant has several locations across the city. And today we're eating at the one in Recoleta. Have you chosen what you want for lunch Sam? I think we're getting pretty close to ordering our meal, yeah. Yeah. So they have some pretty cool napkins. Comé Sin Culpa means eat without guilt. And we're pretty good at that. Oh yeah. Okay, so we have placed our order and now we're just filling up on bread until it comes. But Sam, can you tell us what a Milanesa is for people who aren't too familiar with this dish? Sure, so Milanesa is basically a meat fillet that has been dipped in egg and coated in bread and then deep-fried. So it is somewhat similar to a Schnitzel but it has a very unique Argentine twist. Yeah, it is really good. It is thinner than a Schnitzel actually. And it is usually veal but it can also be beef or chicken. Yeah. So we'll actually have to try these in order to be able to tell you what they are exactly. But at first glance this looks like guacamole, barbecue sauce, mustard, this looks like mozzarella cheese with a tomato and basil, this one is ham and cheese and tomato sauce, this is a cream of cheddar and melted cheddar with bacon over top. We couldn't decide which one to order so why not get a sampler portion. Yeah, so we get seven different ones to sample and that comes with a salad and these delicious potatoes. Cheesy fries. Alright, looks good. Let's get all of the toppings on there. Mmmm. How is that? Oh, yeah. So that is veal, cheddar cheese, a little bit of bacon. Um, and like thinly sliced spring onions on top. And it is really tender meat. Like it is so soft. Wow. So I am having the Caprese one which is spinach, cheese which appears to be mozzarella and tomato. I think that is actually basil but we'll let it slide. That's really good. When you add the tomato like that it gives it an extra bit of juiciness which I really like. Nice and fresh. Good stuff. Next up guacamole. Yeah, this looks a little bit Mexican. Let's see. I'm going to try some of this. Mmmm. That's good guacamole. It has lots of lime. It also has tomatoes and I think I'm having parsley. Not cilantro. I can usually tell when it is cilantro. That is pretty special. But yeah, another good one. Alright, next up. This one appears to have ham, tomato sauce and cheese as a topping. Mmmm. Wow. You know what, I thought just the kind of cheese they may put on top of this might be processed or kind of low quality but this is really good high quality cheese. And so far this one is by far my favorite. Okay, yet another. Any idea what this one is? I think it is barbecue sauce. Just at first glance. It smells like it. We'll see. Let's get that on there. Mmmm. It is barbecue sauce. And you know what. I grew up eating Milanesas but I never would have thought to put barbecue sauce on it. That is pretty unusual. But it works. I actually like it. I think it may be one of my favorites so far. She's taking a second bite. And that one appears to have pickle. Yeah, let's see. It looks like Dijon mustard. It has a pickle, it has some bacon and spring onions. That's Dijon mustard for sure. Again, that is a bit unusual. I tend to only put mustard on hot-dogs or sausages so I've never had it with Milanesa before. But it works. It is different. Alright, and last but not least, I've got one that appears to have cream of cheddar with some bacon added. Mmmmm. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. That's like having high Cheese Whiz put on top. And then you add a little bacon. Big time winning combo. Big time. Okay, so this right here I'm really excited about. This is our side dish and it is called papas criminales. Criminal potatoes. And again, this looks like an Argentinian twist on the Canadian poutine. So it is French Fries with lots of different toppings. So let's take a little tour of the bowl and I'm going to tell you what is in here. So we have mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese and we have red onions and some paprika and spring onions. So why don't we just mix it all around. Oh, and scrambled eggs, oh and bacon. It is the dish that keeps on giving. Look at that. A little bit of everything. Oh my, I love poutine so this right up my alley. Look at that. Mmmm. Nothing healthy about it I bet it is amazing. I know. Our main order of Milanesa came with these potatoes and a salad. And I think the salad is going to be a little bit neglected on this meal. So we're finishing up the meal and Sam has altogether given up on cutlery. It's caveman style the rest of the way to finish all of this. Yeah. Well, we sure took care of that. We demolished that. How are you feeling? This is a classic case of my eyes being a little bigger than my stomach. I am not full. I'm beyond full. So basically my siesta is going to be starting really early today and I think I'm going to be having a longer one than usual. Alright, and if someone wants to try to get similarly stuffed like we did what would they be looking at in terms of price? Okay, so that whole sampler with the potatoes, you know the criminal potatoes and the salad came to over 300 Pesos and that is just over twenty US dollars. So not a bad price for feeding two grown people. Yeah, we could have used a third person honestly. Yeah. Bring a friend. #eatArgentina So it is a bit of a rainy day out here in Buenos Aires so we thought let's start the day with something sweet. So we came to one of our favorite cafes. This place is called Petit Colon and we're going to be sampling facturas. So a factura is an elaborate European pastry and these were brought over by European immigrants. And now you can find countless varieties. So we've ordered six different ones, they're looking pretty good right over here. So we're going to be sampling those. And you can get them with lots of different toppings. Um, we have a few with custard, some with quince jam and generally you can also get some with dulce de leche. But those tend to be the first ones to disappear because they're so good. So we don't have any dulce de leche right now. Yeah. So we have to show you Sam's coffee because it is pretty fancy. Yeah, normally when I go out for coffee in Buenos Aires I end up getting cafe con leche. That is kind of your standard coffee. But I'm getting a little bit fancy pants today. I have ordered a cappacino that comes with a heaping amount of cinnamon on top. Yeah, cappuccino con canela. Yes, so it is time to try that. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's really good. I mean I like my cafe con leche but if I can upgrade it to a cappuccino then it is worth doing so. It looks like the holiday season in a cup. Yes. Okay. So let's start with this one. Look at that. Oh! Mmmmm. Oh, wow. That's really good stuff. Have a look. So it is kind of like a light buttery fluffy pastry. This one has crema pastalera which is kind of like a custard and it also has shaved coconut on top and little bit of glaze. So good! I'm going in for a second bite. Would you say it is scrumptious? Scrumptious! Alright, time for me to dig in. So this is my first one here. It appears to have maybe a slice of orange or peach. I'm not entirely sure. I think it is peach. It could be peach. I'll try to get a bite of the peach. Mmmmm. Wow. It is peach. And these are really buttery, moist and like you really taste the sugar too. I mean these facturas are good quality stuff. Let's get a closer look. So that was peach and custard right? Custard in the middle. Peach, custard and a few nuts it would appear. Yep, walnuts. Alright, time for another. So this one has poppy seed and cherry in the middle. Mmmmm. Okay. I've never had a factura with poppyseed before. But it gives it a nice little hint in the background. It is kind of nice. I like it. Now let's bite into the cherry. I need the cherry. Mmmmm. Oh yeah. Kind of feel like a chipmunk. My cheeks are full of facturas. Yum, yum, yum. Okay, so number two. That one looks good. Yeah, this one has jam on it. We think it might be quince jam. Let's try. Mmmmmm. Yeah, it is. I can tell it is quince jam because it is quite a bit more tart than say strawberry jam. Yeah, you've been having a lot of that lately. Yeah, it is really growing on me. In fact, I'm going to miss it when we leave. Yeah, and this factura looks like it has a bit of a party going on because it has quince on one side. It has got sprinkles and then it has custard. Custard on the other side. A little bit of everything. That one has got a little bit of everything. Yeah. And this one is my third. Again, this one has crema pastalera like the three previous ones. But this one has a bit of icing sugar on top. So a little different. I mean it is a small little difference between pastries. Mmmm. It is also good. And there is something in the middle there. I wonder what that is. Dulce de leche. Oh my gosh. No way. Show. Let's see it. That is dulce de leche. Move it over so we can see it. There it is. See, so you can find some pastries with dulce de leche. You just have to come early. Mmmmmm. And this one is the best. I like the combination of the two. Okay, and this last one that I'm trying here appears to be very similar to the first one that I tried. But this one has sprinkles but it also has custard and peach. So I'm going to try to get a little bit of all three in this bite. You know what, it has a different kind of custard. This one tastes more like pudding. Yeah. So it is different from the first one. And this one is my favorite by far. Well, we polished all of that off. No problem. All six of them. Yeah, and the facturas were basically 15 a piece. So you're looking at about 1 US dollar per each factura. Really good value considering how scrumptious the pastries were. And we couldn't recommend this cafe more highly. It is right inside of the Theatre Colon. Right around the corner. Yeah, if you're right in this area pop in here and have a coffee and some snacks. #eatArgentina Tadadada! Alright, so as you can probably guess from this for today's video we are in our kitchen in Buenos Aires and we are going to be teaching you how to make Yerba Mate. So, one thing we've noticed here in the supermarkets is that they have entire aisles dedicated to Mate. There must be like fifty varieties out there at least. Seriously, it was like a daunting task. Yeah, how do we choose? Which one is the right one? Um, but if you've never heard of Mate before it is kind of like a green tea. It is basically a green leaf that they kind of like smash together. Um, and you use it to make tea but not in a tea cup. We're going to be using these little things. These little mugs. Um, and normally they are made out of gourd. So that is kind of like a hollowed out pumpkin or something like that. But these are a bit more modern. I've got my matryoshka here. Show them my Monsieur Mustache. My Mr. Mustache. So this one is Sam's. Yeah, I'm excited to try that. Yeah, so you can get some that are made out of wood, there is metal ones, there is a whole bunch to choose from. But anyways, let's start making this thing. So let's open this. This is our first time making it. Oh la lah. It is kind of funny. This is our first time making it and yet we're teaching you how it is done. Ha, ha. Can we be trusted? That is how we roll. That is the question. What is it they say? If you want to learn how to do something teach someone else how to do it. And there you go. We are, so we're going to want to fill it up about 2/3's of the way. Oh, and first you should probably have a look inside the bag. Look at that. So you can see how the leaves have been kind of crushed. You get a really good view from there. It is kind of like a loose leaf. Alright, fill it up two thirds of the way. Two thirds. That would appear to be two thirds. There you go. And they say that you should put your palm over it and kind of shake it to help the. Oh crap, it is going everywhere. Shake it up baby. To help the smaller leaves, or like the powder, settle near the top so it doesn't get stuck in your straw. But my hand is too little so it is flying everywhere. Look at that powder. Anyways, so then we're going to take our little straw. This is called bombila and just stick it right in there at an angle. And then we're going to grab our water which I boiled earlier. You don't want to use boiling hot water so we've had this sitting for a few minutes. Yes, they say the key is 75 degrees. 75 degrees. So that is what we're going for. So, well, I didn't really check the temperature guys, but let's just go with that. There we go. Filler up. Filler up buttercup. There we are. Have a look at that. It is still bubbling. Oh, did we do it wrong. Oh! So ready for the first sip. I didn't add any sugar to mine because I don't normally have sugar with my tea. Oh natural. Oh natural. Let's have a sip of this. Mmmm. Yes. It's been a while since I had this. I never really enjoyed it as a kid when I was living in Argentina. I always thought it was gross and bitter. Haha. So it is interesting trying it as an adult. How many years later. Have your taste buds matured a little bit? Would you say? Yeah, I'm used to drinking green tea now so I do like this. It is a little bit bitter and it kind of has a grassy flavor. Can you taste those herbs? Yeah, I mean it tastes green. Like grass. Like I'm eating grass in a field. Like a horse. Hahaha. Yeah, so it is actually nice. I am enjoying it. Um, and as you can see the water level has kind of gone down so you just grab some more hot water and keep refilling this. And the cool thing about this is you can fill it up upwards to 10 to 20 times before you need to replace the Mate. Yeah, so you can just. And it is a very social drink. Like if you see people drinking this on the streets of Buenos Aires you'll notice they'll be passing around the same gourd and the same straw. Yes. You just share. Saliva doesn't matter. Just pass it along. There you go. Alright, it is time for me to make my Mate tea now. The Mister Mustache gourd is waiting. And unlike yours, I'm going to make mine, with sugar. Okay, show us how it is done. Showtime. So once again, two thirds of the way full. There is a lot that you can get in there. Mmmhmmm. And of course some sugar. I' going to give it a generous amount. What is a generous amount, Sam? I'd say about 2/3rds of a tablespoon. That is a lot of sugar. That is not even a teaspoon. That is like a tablespoon. It is. And time for the water infusion. So, now we wait for the magic to happen. Yeah, the difference here being I'm going to be stirring mine so that I can mix that sugar in. Mixing, mixing, mixing. I don't know if locals would approve. Alright, let's try the sweetened version of that Mate here. Mmmmm. Wow. Yeah, that is uh that is really nice. If you like something sweet then you're going to want to add sugar to it. Because, what I find though is when you add too much sugar, kind of like what I did, you kind of mask that strong taste of the mate. So I prefer mine oh natural without sugar. But if you enjoy your tea or coffee sweet then you'll want to add some to yours. So, the question is tea or mate? Which do you prefer? Well, when you're in South America, especially in Argentina you're going to want to prefer mate. Because this is like the national drink here. Yeah, we've seen people drinking this during demonstrations, during their lunch breaks, while they're hanging out at the park. Yes. Everywhere. It is an everyday part of life and if you come to Argentina - especially Buenos Aires - you're going to want to try it. And all the other items that we used are super easy to pickup at a supermarket. And they are also really cheap. Yeah, you can also go get them at the different fairs. You can get them at the Sunday San Telmo Market or the Recoleta Sunday Fair. And you're going to pay a bit more, you're going to pay a touristy prices but you'll get something that is a bit more like artesanal. Yeah. Blooper Alert! So here it is. We're going to have our first sip of mate. I didn't add any sugar to mine because I normally don't have sugar. Sugah. I don't have sugar. Hahahaha. Where is the sugar? My gosh. I can't speak English Okay. Can you see him filming? Look at this. Okay, so today we're doing something a little bit different. We've been filming a lot of food videos at restaurants here in Buenos Aires. But for today's lunch we're going to be trying food by the weight. Or comida por kilo. And these are kind of like establishments that are open only during the lunch hours. It is usually from eleven to three or eleven to four PM. And you go there, you grab a container, you fill it up with whatever you feel like eating and then they weigh it, you pay and you're all set. So it is pretty cool because there is a really great selection there. You get to eat what you want, maybe a little bit healthier and yeah these places are located in areas where you have a lot businesses, offices. So let's go, let's go eat some lunch. After you, sir. We've got our plates. Now we fill them up with whatever we feel like having. And this is the salad bar. Take your own. Got everything you need Sam? Loaded up big time. Yes, is that enough for lunch? I think you need a bit more. Maybe some greens. My greens plate is over there. I'll show you that one later. So we are back in the apartment. Yeah, it is chow time. I'm so hungry. I don't, I've often been skipping breakfast here. And so by the time we go there at eleven o'clock I'm absolutely ravenous. So if you take a look down here you'll see that I've got like this kind of eclectic mix of food. Caneloni, I've got ravioli. Caneloni. So cantaloni is kind of like a pancake that has been stuffed with something savory. It could be meat or spinach. Yeah, exactly. And over here I have a fish ball that includes salmon inside, I've got a huge wedge of avocado. There we go. Sweet potato, various kinds of mixed rice, Asian inspired rice. And then over here I have like grilled eggplant and fried cheese and egg-rolls. Noodles. That is a little bit messy. I just went for it all today. Alright, well dig in. Okay, so why don't we try some ravioli to start off with. And there is so much variety at this place that we go to. You could eat any type of food. Italian. There is Italian. There is Italian, classic Argentine food, all kinds of Asian food. And they have an enormous salad buffet. That is actually what I'd normally be doing. I'm going to show you this here. I actually bought myself dinner. This is just a pure salad. So I'm having my hot warm stuff now and this is just all pure vegetarian salad here for later on today. And since we bought so much they gave us little dinner rolls as well. Nice. And alright we can't forget the wine. I mean we didn't get this at the food by the weight place. No. But since we're in Argentina you've got to have a glass of red wine with your meal. Yes, and if you're going to choose any particular wine you'll want to get Malbec because that is the national grape. Argentina is known for making Malbec wine. And the favorite one I've been drinking is one from Cafayate. Which is you know just south of Salta. And we were actually able to tour the vineyards in Cafayate so you know it kind of has like sentimental value for us. We get a little bit nostalgic thinking about it. But the other main area where they produce wine, and it is even a bit more famous than Cafayate is Mendoza. So I'm going to try the wine here. Salud. To health. Oh, so good. So so good. And this is a really good bottle. This is a 2013 edition. And you know I paid just over a 100 Pesos for it. And if you're at that price range in Buenos Aires you're going to find yourself a really nice bottle of wine here. The food, the food. Alright, let's have a look at my plate. So this is what I got. I've got grilled eggplant with mozzarella and a bit of oregano on top. I have a chili chicken. This is really good. And this one is my favorite. It is a spicy chili chicken that I really enjoy. I have some sweet potato mash, I have some Asian noodles happening underneath here. Some avocado, potatoes, champignion mushrooms and this is kind of like a quiche. And egg quiche with veggies. And well the salad just got left behind. You know there is a small portion in there at the bottom. There is a token amount at the bottom corner. Yeah, and these meals are super affordable. We've been paying about thirty to fifty pesos depending on what we get. I mean if you're mostly having salads, which are quite light, it'll be closer to thirty but if you go for like heavy meals with lots of meat and carbs and potatoes it is usually a bit more. So quite affordable. In US dollars what would that be? Do the math Sam. Yes, that is like you're talking about three dollars. Three US dollars. Two fifty to three US dollars. Yeah, and you know we've been shooting a lot of food videos in this series but when we're not filming this is what we've eating. We're going to the food by the weight. This is actually what we're eating most of the time here. Alright, well let's just dig in. This is going to be kind of messy because I forgot to get a knife. Oopsies. Ah, whatever, let's just dig in. Mmmmm. That is so nice. And for a place that is as cheap as this is like the quality is really quite high. Like very high. You're not getting you know disgusting fast food. This is good food. It is all fresh. They prepare it every morning before opening. So it is really nice. And also I should mention that these places, food by the weight, they're almost on every street corner. So it doesn't matter where you are. You'll be able to find one no problem. Yeah, and another really good tip for going to these food places is to arrive early. Not only do avoid the crowds but you get the freshest and the best of what they've just put out. Yeah, if you go there at twelve thirty or one most of the food will be gone. Like the really good stuff. So we always show up at eleven AM as soon as they open. Which means we're having an early lunch but we're getting to eat exactly what we want. #eatArgentina So for today's lunch video we've gone back to our favorite bakery - La Pasta Frola - and we've gotten some sandwiches. But these aren't just any kind of sandwiches. These are special. These are Sandwiches de Miga. And Miga is actually a word that we don't really have in the English language. It is used to refer to the white part of the bread. Like you know sliced bread. The white part that is really soft. Basically the non-crust area. Not the crust would be Miga. So let's open this up. Sam ran off to the bakery for us and got four different varieties. And there you have it. Oh la lah. So these sandwiches are really popular at birthday parties or family gatherings just because they're super easy to pickup at a bakery. You don't actually have to make them yourself. Because you know that would be a little time consuming. So just pop into the bakery choose a few different varieties and you're all set. You can feed an army. So I'm ready to dig in to this first one here. Which one are you trying? Well, I can see some tomato and potentially some deli meat. So as you can see it is super thin, super light. Kind of a fragile sandwich really. So you want to be careful with it. Mmmmm. So that is really nice. It has nice slices of tomato in there. So that makes it really nice and juicy and refreshing. I can also taste butter. They've spread butter on the breach which is really nice. And that does appear to be turkey. So yeah nice little sandwich right here. What is Turkey in Spanish? Pavo. So first up for me I'm going to try one that has tuna and cheese. So let's take a look at that. See if we can peel back that tuna a bit. And then you can see the cheese on the bottom layer. That one looks good. Big bite. Mmmmm. That's good. Those are happy noises. Nom nom nom. One of my favorite sandwiches is tuna and cheese sandwich so I'm not surprised that I like this. And I just find this bread is so light and fluffy. You just bite into it and so yeah these are not heavy sandwiches. These feel more like snack sandwiches to me. Yeah, you could have like twenty of them and not be full. Yeah, I know. So next up I'm trying a healthy one. This one is whole grain. And if you have a closer look we've got spinach leaves in here. And also, ooh, this looks like Prosciutto. So this one is going to be good. I'm excited. That looks tasty. Hmmmm. Hmmm, mmmm mmmm. Messy. Okay, that's nice. Hmmmm. Okay. So the whole grain bread. It is a little bit drier than the white bread so I can tell they've put a little bit more butter in between each of the layers. A nice spread of butter in there. I can see that butter. Yeah. Um, and also I should mention that you can also get these sandwiches toasted. Especially the ham and cheese ones on white bread. You'll find that at any cafe. Like you can get that for breakfast, for your afternoon tea, you can just ask for a Tostado de jamón y queso. And that'll be a sandwich like this but toasted. So yeah. And last but not least. So I'm trying basically the classic cheese and tomato but this time it is on the whole grain. Kind of like the one you tried. And this is my first time trying the whole grain, so. Yeah, you're right. The bread is a little bit drier than the white. But like as you've said with your previous sandwich they've compensated by adding a little bit more butter. Yeah, and then the tomato also makes it juicer too also. Yeah, this is one of my favorite ones here. So that was a nice little snack. Do you want to tell us the price for that? Yes, that definitely wasn't enough for a meal but as a snack it was great. It came to 93 Pesos which is six US dollars. And yeah, it was a snack where I think we're still a little hungry. We're still hungry so I think we're going to head out for lunch. Hahaha. Surprise! Off to the bodegón we go. Well, for today's meal we are going Italian. We're at a placed called Los Inmortales. Which means the immortals. It is a very established restaurant that dates back to the 50's and it is located in the theatre district here in Buenos Aires. And we've ordered something called a Calzone. Which is basically like a folded pizza. Now, I don't think I've ever had that before even in North America, so it'll be an interesting experience. I think Sam will really enjoy it because he loves any type of pizza. So yeah, we're just waiting for that to arrive. It should be coming soon. Are you eagerly awaiting the arrival of our meal. Yeah, I'm seriously excited - especially for this one because I've never had a Calzone before. And considering how much pizza I've had in my life that is kind of shocking to be honest. Yeah, they kind of have like an imitation in Canada. It is called Pizza pockets. Yeah, it is like these microwavable folded pizzas. And you know, they're awful. They taste awful. It's like junk food for teenagers once they come back from school. Yeah, I don't think I've probably haven't had one of those since I was 16 or 17. Yeah, same here. Yeah, and anyways, we picked out this place to eat through, I did a bit of research online and this was rated as one of the top pizza places in Buenos Aires and they said they specialized in Calzones. And also it is one of the older joints in the city so this is really cool. This place has a lot of character. So the Calzone has arrived and first things first. I am shocked by the size of this thing. Like, have a look at it over here. This is just half of it because our waiter already sliced it and served us up our individual portions. But look at that. It really was the size of a whole pizza folded in half. Look at how thick it is. Like the stuffing is just oozing out. Use your hand as a sense of scale here. A sense of scale. How do you want? Arrgghh. But yeah, it is massive. I think we're going to struggle to finish this. Like you could feed three people. Three or four people. Well I'm hungry today so. Alright. So first bite. Alright, time for the first bite. So, so far I can see tomato, mozzarella, there is ham, mushrooms and who knows. There may be a few more surprises in there. We'll see what we find. Mmmmm. Oh, wow. How do you like that? Oh, hot. You know what you always forget to blow on your food. Oh man, that was really hot. Okay, anyways it is really nice. It was a like a lot of cheese in there so you really have to chew it because it is so stringy and gooey. Um, but yeah I do enjoy it. Is this similar to pizza? It kind of is um but you know what there is no tomato sauce. That is what sets it apart from a pizza. This calzone has no tomato sauce. It is just the filling. Um, so it is kind of nice. I have to say I do like it. I do like it. I'm pleasantly surprised. So let's see what the pizza expert has to say about the Calzone. Well, before I even tuck into this like look at how much cheese there is. A copious amount of cheese. It is actually oozing out. I literally haven't touched this. This is just how it was served on my plate. Yeah. So I'm going to try to grab a bit of everything here. So I'll cut it up and try to get a big slab of that cheese. I feel like we almost need a spoon for this. Mmmmm. Wow. That is a lot of cheese. But the one thing that surprises me, like this is just my first bite ever to try this, is that it is a lot juicier than what I thought. Like with all of the mushrooms and tomatoes I can see why you don't need a sauce. It is quite juicy as it is. Yeah. And there is a lot more bread than on a typical with the dough. Like you really get a big chunk of bread when you bite into it. But you know what, I am missing the tomato sauce. Like that is just something that I associate with pizza toppings. So I feel like that is missing. Yeah, but who knows maybe they do have calzones with tomato sauce and we just maybe we got the wrong one. Hahaha. We don't know because it is our first time trying it. So time for final thoughts on this dish. What did you think Sam? So overall it was really quite good. Like it was fascinating to finally try this Calzone for the first time. But there was one point of criticism that I'd like to point out it is that they used canned mushrooms. Ewww. That is a big no no for Sam. Yeah, I just find them slimy and a little bit yucky. I mean, I ate them but yeah not your favorite. But in terms of portion that was massive. We couldn't finish it all. So, it defeated us. We're getting it packed up and we're going to take it home for a little snack or for dinner tonight. And the other thing I wanted to mention was just along this particular avenue, Avenida Corrientes, there is a lot of historical restaurants. Some of them are pushing the one century mark, some of them are almost 100 hundred years old. So if you're going to go to dine anywhere in the city I really recommend this particular street. There is a lot of historical restaurants worth checking out. And last but not least price point? Okay, so that Calzone was just a little bit over 200 Pesos which is about $14 US dollars or about seven per person. So not bad but I have to say I do prefer pizza. You can get some really good pizza in the city. So this is okay but it is not necessarily a dish that I would like chase. Yeah, and not just in the city but you can also get really good pizza here. We saw someone order a pizza and it looked delicious. Yeah, food envy. A little bit of food envy.",False,20170410 - Ultimate ARGENTINIAN FOOD GuideΓÇ»≡ƒçª≡ƒç╖ ∩╜£ 12 MustΓÇæTry Dishes inΓÇ»BuenosΓÇ»AiresΓÇ»&ΓÇ»Beyond in Argentina.en.srt

So I guess we should explain that we aren't doing the traditional Inca trail. Normally you can do a four day walk or a 10 day walk. We're actually only doing a two day walk. We're not really lazy it is just kind of how it happened. Come on we are. Maybe, maybe just a little bit. We crave our comfort. So basically we're going to be hiking for a full day and then we're going to get to our Aguas Calientes and stay in a hotel. We're not staying in tents. And then the following day we'll be touring Machu Picchu with a guide and like learning the history of the place. So I guess really it is only one day walking the Inca Trail but we're going to say two to feel a little better about ourselves. So within five minutes of walking we've already reached our first Inca site. This is amazing. More than five hundred years ago there were so many people hiking on the Inca Trails to get to Machu Picchu. This is because Machu Picchu was a holy city for them. Pachacuti is the famous person here. We consider to him as Alexander the Great of the Andes. So I think at this point we've probably been hiking for an hour and a half or two. How are you feeling? I'm hot, I'm sweaty and we've been going uphill almost the entire way. So I'm looking forward to hitting the lunch point and then going downhill all the way to Machu Picchu. Same here! Sam is really getting into his photography over there. Coming? How is the walk? I'm still tired. Still tired? Still sweaty? Oh, yeah. But we're still walking. Still going at it. Still walking in desperate need of a shower at the end of this. And maybe ice cream? Maybe ice cream. More like a hot springs. So we are half way done the hike. What is something that has really surprised you so far? I guess maybe how the vegetation keeps changing. Like when we first started out the trek it was green. Sure. But like now as we're getting deeper into the mountains and like closer to waterfalls and rivers it is really lush and there is lots of moss. And the temperatures is actually a bit cooler. Like before I was sweating and it was really humid but now the temperature is starting to drop which is really really nice. We've almost made it to the archaeological site that we can see off in the distance. Wiñay Wayna. Straight ahead! 360! This place is divided into three parts. Okay. So it is similar to Machu Picchu. The only difference is that Machu Picchu is much much bigger than this. In this area where the terraces are those people find the remains of the coca plants. You know coca was one important plant for the Quechua for the Inca people. Oh yeah. They used coca as the currency. They used coca for medicine purposes. They used coca for religious purposes. It looks like beans to me. But it is llama poop. So what we've encountered the monkey steps. I think this is going to require climbing on all fours. Let's go. Do the monkey. Do the monkey. That's not very monkey like. Well, it is not very monkey like. So what! So we've reached Intipunku and this is where we're going to get our first view of Machu Picchu. And considering how long we've walked I think we've earned it. Intipunku. This way. Triumphant! Where did we make it to? We it to the Sun Gate. Barely. Barely. Machu Picchu! Machu Picchu! We made it. How are you feeling? I know. After that long hike. It is amazing. And we're so lucky to have views like this because apparently it was raining for three days before we did this hike. I know. And we have sunshine and blue skies and the lost city is waiting for us. Just over there. Going for the Llama selfie. Going for the llama selfie. Hi llama. Hi llama. Let's be friends. Or ignore me. So that is a wrap from Machu Picchu. We finished the hike and tomorrow we'll be back to actually explore the lost city. Yeah, we have two days to do that so that is awesome. We can't wait. So do you think people will be able to guess where we are based on the landscape? I'm not too sure. It's quite foggy right now. Where could we be? What could be off in the distance? Good question. Should we tell? Yes. It is Machu Picchu. Machu Picchu. That is Machu Picchu guys. Breathtaking is it not? This is a baby llama having breakfast. Breakfast time. Can you give us an update on the current situation? So the current situation is that it has stopped raining. Yes. And it is starting to clear a bit. We're hopeful. Right now it is eight thirty six, and we're hopeful that maybe around ten or eleven, if it doesn't rain again, that we'll have some sunshine. Clear visibility of Machu Picchu. Get those iconic views. Yeah. We know that the Quechua people were able to mummify people. But they used to mummify some important people from their culture. So they used to mummify to the royal family, they used to mummify to some people who were part of the high class people. So then they'd take the bodies. The mummies into the cave and they'd put them you know in the fetal position because they used to believe that they could enter into a different life after this life. Rocking the new hats. The chuyos. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the soldiers possibly used this to place the torch. The fire. Okay. But also they could maybe place here a pet which was maybe a llama or this was maybe an alpaca that they would use to sacrifice in one of the temples. So here we're checking out an Inca toilet. Is it an en-suite? I'd say so. What are we doing Audrey? Getting our Machu Picchu stamp. So this one is yours. Ready. Ta da. Welcome to my home. This is the living area. It still needs to be furnished. And this over here is going to be a little reading nook and I'm put my books there, there and there. Alright, so we found a nice quiet spot here and I want to know your impressions of coming back to Machu Picchu for a second time? Coming back a second time. Honestly, it is still amazing. It is still impressed me. It still has that 'wow factor' like six or seven years later. I think it is just one of those sites that is I don't know, so special, and also it always looks different because the weather here changes so dramatically and it changes so quickly. So like when we first got here in the morning it was super cold and foggy and we couldn't even see Machu Picchu but now it is like the sun is starting to come out and the sky is starting to clear so it is really cool just hanging out here for a few hours and seeing how it all changes. So yeah, I'm glad I came back. Okay, so Sam, you visited Machu Picchu about six years ago, how has does this trip compare to that one? This is like night and day. Six years ago I was the ultimate cheapskate backpacker. I came to Machu Picchu using the cheapest transportation route possible. Basically I took this van on this really twisty serpentine off-road area and then I went across on this cable car using this wooden trolley. It was really dangerous. And then eventually we did a bit of walking and took a train to get here. And I was so cheap at the time that they have these little buses that ply up and down to get up to Machu Picchu. And I was so cheap that I ended up walking up and down that big hill and it was like exhausting. By the time we actually got to Machu Picchu I was already tired. Yeah, because that is a 25 minute bus ride. So you were walking that would be a couple of hours. And it is like up like that so yeah a completely different experience this time around. It was nice to do it using the actual Inca Trail, staying at a little bit of a nicer accommodation and coming to see Machu Picchu with a guide this time around. Okay, so now next question. I know people always see Machu Picchu in documentaries, postcards, magazines. Do you think it is important for people to see it in person? Yeah, absolutely. It's actually one of these wonders of the world that actually lives up to its reputation. And what I really think, what I really get out of coming to Machu Picchu is just a sense of the sheer scale of the place. Like it is massive. When you come here and walk around you get a really good sense of just how big this lost city of the Inca's is. Woo hoo! Go Machu Picchu! If you're planning to walk the Inca Trail or visit Machu Picchu, you'll likely end up spending at least a few days in Cuzco. With it's lively square, quirky museums, artisans markets and traditional performances, this is exactly the type of destination you'll want to linger in...plus let's not forget, it's also a good place to adjust to the altitude! The following video will showcase 15 things to do in Cuzco: Cuzco Cathedral is a place you shouldn't miss. The cathedral sits on the site of Viracocha Inca’s palace, and it was also built using blocks from the nearby Inca site of Sacsaywamán. Inside you'll find impressive works of art done in the cuzqueña style. So we've been walking around town and we came across this fine example of Inca architecture. If you take a look at this wall right next to me and you can see how they've like placed the stones so that there isn't even a crack in between each of them. And apparently we haven't tried this but you can try and like stuff a sheet of paper and won't even fit because the stones just sit on top of each perfectly. So, that's pretty cool. So there is a joke that my tour guide me last time I visited Cusco. And basically he said there is a section of wall that was built by the Inka. And that is what you can see behind me. But there is also a section of wall that was built by the Incapables or the Spaniards. And you can see that over here. And it is quite obvious that the stones don't really interlock quite the way the Inca were able to make them. In the evenings, you can go watch a traditional dance performance at Centro Qosqo. (traditional Peruvian folk music) San Blas is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Cuzco and it is a great area to explore on foot. The neighborhood is known for its bright blue doors and window shutters, and it has a nice little square with a church and a water fountain. The neighbourhood has some really cool lookout points with great panoramic views of Cuzco, so you'll want to bring your camera. So this afternoon is a bit of a shopping afternoon. And we're at the Qorikancha market. They have lots of really cool crafts and clothes and really great souvenirs. So I did a bit of shopping and I'm going to show you. You sure did. My purchase. I'm pretty happy with it. Look at this. A nice little alpaca sweater. And show us the hat too. It's going to be really warm for when we walk the Inca trail. Show us the hat. And we got some cool hats as well. And you've got to try it on of course. Ah, no. Try it on. But it is going to look silly. You are silly though. But I have a big bun right now. Oh, yeah. We'll zoom in for that. Come on, smile. We're going to be trying some traditional food from Cusco. So we've placed our order and we're waiting for our food to arrive. I'm not entirely sure what to expect because I've never really tried food from this region. We've been eating light meals since we got to Cuzco just because we're trying to deal with the altitude sickness, so yeah, this is our first day that we're ready for our big hearty meal. So until the meal arrives you've got some nice bread rolls in your hand. Yeah, these were freshly baked in the oven and can't wait to try them. We have two different kinds of spicy sauces. They're both called 'aji' sauces, so let's take a look down here and we're going to dunk it in. Actually there is spoons so I can do it a little more civilized I suppose. And I will put a little bit of red and a bit of green. Why not. Let's try that. Mmmm. Is that burning your mouth? Is your mouth on fire at the moment? Yeah, I'm tasting more of the sauce than the bread. But the bread is good. It is melting in my mouth. And it was made in the oven right behind you. Right over there. Right over there. Fancy. So my meal has arrived. I ordered a soup and I'm having something called Chayro Cusqueño and if you have a look down over here it is basically a soup with lamb and Andean greens. I'm not sure what kind of greens those would be. It kind of looks like barley. Um, there might be some Quinoa in there. I don't really know but it is really hearty and you can see it has potatoes and carrots and celery and it looks really really good. So let's try it. Mmmm. Oh. Wow! That's like a nice thick flavorful soup. Um, I can't really tell what these little green leaves are. I wonder if it is parsley or cilantro. Mmmm. But it is really nice. I like that is has a really thick texture because of the potato that breaks apart and you obviously have the grains and the meat. I still haven't tried the meat. Here is my lamb. So yeah, that is really nice. It's the kind of dish you want to order on a really cold day to warm you up. And I like that it is served in a nice cute little bowl that you can warm up your hands. I'm a little bit chilly in case you can't tell. So yeah, good soup. And you ordered something called Pachapapa and we're not entirely sure if that is a name that the restaurant gave to the meal or if that is really what the meal is called in this part of Peru. Yeah, we have no idea we just came to this restaurant, ordered it on a whim and so what I'm thrilled about is that if we take a look at our my plate is that I've got a lot of different stuff going on. I've got a salad, I've got the meat, I've got the tamale, I've got potatoes covered in cheese and I have some kind of stuffed pepper. But being the carnivore that I am I think I will try the meat first. And can you tell us what kind of meat this is? Because it is not beef. Yeah, it is Alpaca meat. Alpaca? Indeed! So pretty special. Dig in. I've never tried Alpaca before. Does it taste like beef? Chicken or fish? It tastes something like of in between chicken and beef. This particular cut is really tender and it has a lot of seasonings on it so it is quite good. It's not as game-y as I thought it would be. Alright, time to try my tamale. And the tamale is made with corn. Mmmm. Yellow corn. That's one of the best tamales I've ever had. I think it's got cheese. Yeah, it's got cheese in there. Mmmm. Oh, my. I have food envy all of a sudden. That is so good. You better hope I share with you. Okay, so my kind husband is willing to share this stuffed pepper which I was told has beef and vegetables and melted cheese on top. So let's take a good chunk since he's in the mood to share. It's not so much I'm in the mood to share. I'm just not sure I can eat it all myself. Mmmmm. That's like ground beef and man that is actually spicy. My tongue is on fire right now. But it is tasty obviously because I'm still chewing. But yeah, nice. I like that you have a very full plate and you get to sample a little bit of everything. So we tried to make this as authentic of a meal in Cusco as we possibly could, so I got my Cusqueña beer. And tomorrow we're going to try and find Cuy. We are now visiting the Pisco Museum which is a bit unusual. It is not exactly a museum in the sense that you walk around and look at Pisco bottles or anything like that. It is more like a bar and you come here to drink Pisco. So we've just placed our order and we're waiting for our drinks to arrive. So they had a special happening at the bar so we've ordered four glasses of Chicanos which are made with pisco, ginger ale and a few drops of bitter. And we were able to choose different flavors. We have strawberry, cinnamon, this is a classic and this one is the one you like. What is that? Licorice. Anise. Anise. Alright. Let's start drinking. Okay, so first up the classic. That is good. Okay. I can taste the alcohol but it is not so strong that it is like burning my throat. It is like a nice summery drink. Very good. Bottoms up for Samuel Jeffery. Yeah, I'm trying one of my favorite ones. Anise. So, I have high expectations. High expectations he says. And unlike your strawberry the Anise is strongly strongly flavorful here. Oh, that means I would not like it. That means I won't be sharing this one at all. And now for a sip of the strawberry. It doesn't have a strong strawberry flavor. I don't know if they've added a syrup or if it is natural fruit. I mean there is one little piece of strawberry in there but I don't think that is flavoring the whole glass. Yeah, a nice girly drink. And the last one for me to try is the cinnamon flavor. Okay, that one is not nearly as strongly as flavored. So, anise for the win. Plaza de Armas is the beating heart of Cuzco. The square is flanked by a Jesuit church and cathedral, and there are also plenty of bars, restaurants, and tour agencies around the perimeter. During the day you'll find locals and tourists hanging out in the square, and if you get lucky, you might just encounter a performance followed by a demonstration like we did. The Inca Museum is one of the main museums in town and it has rooms dedicated to different periods of Inca and Spanish history. You can also see women weaving rugs and tapestries by hand in the central courtyard. So we somehow ended up at the chocolate museum in Cuzco. It is very small but you can learn the history of how chocolate is made and the whole process. And they also have like these little beans. Apparently, that is what cocoa beans look like. Who knew. I'm kind of hoping that they have chocolate that we can sample somewhere but I haven't come across that yet. Fingers crossed. So did you get to try any chocolate? No, free samples but they have a cool place in the store where we can purchase chocolate and they also have a cafe as well. And they have lots of interesting flavors like there is spicy chocolate, cinnamon chocolate, cocoa leaf chocolate. A bit of everything. If you have any chocolate lovers in your family, or as among friends, definitely a good gift to pick up here. Great souvenir. Qurikancha was an Inca temple built to the Sun God, Inti, and it is believed that the walls of this temple were once covered in sheets of gold. If the temple looks like it has various layers of construction, that's because when the Spaniards arrived, they demolished the original temple and used the foundations to build the Church of Santo Domingo on the site. The Church of the Society of Jesus is a historic Jesuit church. It's worth a quick visit if you're in the area. Okay, so time to spew off a few facts about Guinea Pig. Yeah, so the Cuy is something we've been wanting to try for a while now. It is one of the most traditional Peruvian foods you can possibly get. It originates from the Andes. It is a rodent. And apparently the meat is very high in protein and low in cholesterol. So it is healthy for you! Yeah, exactly. Who would have known. This is a perfect meal to have just before our hike to Machu Picchu. Yeah. So another fun fact, because I know you guys really like those is that if you visit Cusco Cathedral, once you go inside you'll see that there is a painting of Jesus and the 12 Disciples enjoying their last supper and guess what they're eating? It's a Guinea Pig and it is lying on its back with its little paws up in the air. So if Guinea Pig is good enough for Jesus and his Disciples we can certainly eat it while we're in Cusco. And they were kind enough to let us go take a look at how it is being cooked and prepared. So let's go walk over and check out the wood fire burning oven. Just over there. Just over there. That is where our Cuy is being made. So our dinner has arrived and I'm trying not to look at the Guinea Pig in the face because it kind of reminds me of my sister's two pet Chinchillas but there it is on the plate. And it comes with a few sides so if you look down here you can see that we have some golden potatoes, some fried yellow potato actually and we have a little salad and we also have a stuffed pepper with cheese melted over top. So yes, I guess the next step is to dig in to our Cuy. So our server has kindly chopped up the Cuy because we didn't really know where to begin and apparently you have to eat this with your hands. Yes, so I'm going to grab just a chunk here. It is time for the first bite. Is that like the back? Oh, the skin. Wow, the meat is quite tender. You know what it tastes a lot like chicken. If I didn't know what I was eating I would have guessed it was chicken. That's good to know. It makes me a feel a little better about taking my first bite. I think I have the back and the hind leg. I'm just taking little nibbles. How does it taste? It's like stringy chicken. How does it taste? It is like stringy chewy chicken. Yeah, like it even looks like chicken. Like the dark meat on a chicken. So you could fool me but I've seen the whole Guinea Pig on the plate. So now I know what I'm having and you just kind of have to get over that because it does make a bit of an impression on you. Especially if you have Chinchillas for pets because they just look so similar. So moving on we're kind of taking a bite of its mid-section here. So what you really notice about when you have Guinea Pig is that the skin is really crispy but the meat inside is quite tender. I actually like it. We're also noticing that there are some organs and bones. Yeah, yeah and strange things inside our Cuy. It is very much cooked as it is and you eat it as it is presented. Yes, that is how you have Cuy in Peru. Except you are using cutlery instead of your hands. You have it all wrong. Oh, right. That's right. So now the verdict. If you saw Cuy on a menu would you order it again? I'm not necessarily sure I would just because it is a bit expensive and I think that if you were to have something like chicken or something else you might get a little bit more meat. But I'm really glad I tried it. It tasted honestly better than I expected and uh yeah if you're Peru definitely try it though at a least once. And your final verdict? Well, it didn't taste bad but that being said I'm not sure I would eat it again. I just don't like seeing the whole animal on my plate. And I know that is kind of silly to say because I do eat meat. I do eat fish. So it doesn't make sense to just eliminate Guinea Pig but yeah not for me. Not for me. Templo de la Merced is another church located one block from Plaza de Armas, and it contains the tomb of two famous conquistadors. So nighttime here in Qusqu and it is time for a drink. What are you sipping on? Just sipping on my Pisco Sour enjoying the nightlife here in Qosqo. Looks like a good drink. And that's a wrap for Cuzco! We hope you enjoyed this video and that it showed you a few of the places you can visit while you're in the city. We recommend spending at least 3 days here, or perhaps a few more if you also want to tour the Sacred Valley. As always, if you have any other suggestions of things to do in Cuzco, feel free to share those in the comments below. We are on Lake Titicaca. Say hello Sam! Hey! Woo! Saraqui! So we are taking a really fun overnight trip from Puno today to visit Lake Titicaca. Yeah, we're going to visit several islands and do a homestay overnight. Yeah, and we'll get to meet the different communities that live here because we have Aymara people and Quechua people. So we've just arrived at our first island. And this one is called Corazon de Lago which means the heart of the lake. And this is an Aymara community that lives on a floating reed island so let's go have a look around. Let's check it out. So it is a bit of a strange sensation walking on the reed islands because it is not solid ground and your feet do sink in a little bit but not to the point where you feel like you're going to fall through and you know go in the water. But still kind of interesting. Okay, so what have we learned so far on this floating reed island? So we've visiting the Uros floating reed islands and there is approximately 80 to 90 of them. And the people who originally came here were escaping hostile neighbors. So this is quite a secluded environment for them. Yeah, exactly. And also we learned that they don't really know like exactly how many islands they have here because they are constantly cutting them up if they have any problems with their neighbors. Yeah, if there is a divorce or if there is problems with neighbors they slash the island up. Yup. Sam, time to take the taxi to the neighboring island. Oh, yeah. Got a pretty sweet ride. So is this the coolest taxi you've ever been on? Or what? Pretty much. I can't think of any taxi that is quite like this. Yeah. I don't think I've been on too many water taxis before either. And it is moving. Yes. So you have a nice new addition in your passport right next to your Machu Picchu stamp. I sure do. So one of the cool things you can do on the floating islands is get a stamp on Lake Titicaca right there. Another one for the collection. I've got Machu Picchu on top. I got that one a few days ago. So I'm filling up my passport quite nicely. We've made it to our third island of the day. This one is called Amantani and this island is actually home to Quechua people whereas the first two that we visited were home to the Aymara people. So, we will be doing a homestay here and spending the night. And right now we are walking towards our home. So, let's keep going. So aside fr om meeting our host families, what I'm most excited for is food. Because it is already lunchtime. It's a little bit past our lunch time actually. And we forgot to pack snacks. Yep. So I'm starving. So before we settle in we're going to get some local food. Yeah, and apparently they are vegetarian on this island, so we're going to be having a Quinoa soup and then just like potatoes and roots and different vegetables. Cheese and stuff like that. Cheese, yes. So it should be good. So are you doing okay? A little bit out of breathe? Yeah, a little bit out of breath. We're still feeling the altitude. Actually Lake Titicaca is higher than Cuzco if you can believe that. And we are walking uphill so keep going. Yeah. And this is going to be our home-stay for the night. We have a very colorful room. A little sofa and we have beautiful views of Lake Titicaca. Come show us those views. Tada. Look at how blue that water is. Wowzers. So what kind of tea are we having Audrey? We are having muña tea which is a local herb that should help us with the high altitude. So we're just breaking some leaves into the cup and adding hot water. Sopa de Quinoa. Ah, sopa de quinoa. Quinoa soup. Ah, que rico. Okay, so it is mealtime at our local home stay. What are you having today? I'm having quinoa soup for lunch. So let's take a look at this. And you can see there is a lot of quinoa, there is also carrots and potatoes and it is piping hot. It just came straight from the pot. So let's try that. Mmm, it's so good. I'm so hungry and this just really hits the spot. Well, now that we're done our soup what is next? So this is our main. We are having rice, potatoes, fried cheese and a little salad on the side. So it looks good. Nice vegetarian meal. So if you're going to stay on this island your best bet is to do a homestay. And what is awesome is that they have this sharing system so that each family has an opportunity to host different international guests. Alright, so we had our lunch, we had our siesta and now we're climbing to the top of the island to watch the sunset. I've also got a bit of muña in my hand to help me get to the top because it is so steep. Feeling that oxygen? Are you feeling that oxygen? That lack of oxygen that is what I'm feeling. But anyways, our group is way ahead so we better start climbing. Something bit you. Your famous last words. What bit you today? A plant bit me. No. I was stung by something called the stinging plant and it stung my middle finger. Let's see the wound. That's the thing. You can't see a wound but they told me it is going to burn for the next ten minutes. My middle finger is on fire. It almost looks like rice patties. So there is two lookout points you can choose from. To the right there is Pachamama and that is the one we're choosing. Pachamama. Pachamama. Through the gate. Through the gate. So we reached the top of Pachamama. How are the views? Oh, we sure did. The views are insane here. It is almost like you're touching the clouds. It is like you can reach up and touch them. Yeah, and the weather has changed quite drastically. We went from t-shirts. I'm not kidding like five minutes ago I was wearing a t-shirt and now I'm bundled up in a sweater and I have a jacket on and a warm hat. Alright, so I think we're going to be heading down soon. Time for dinner and perhaps a little celebration in town. Dance moves. Oh, yeah. He's bringing them. So we're all dressed up, we've had our dinner and now it is time to go to the party. And we are dressed up in traditional outfits. Party! Twirl. Twirl. So are you getting altered over here? Yes, you've got to wear it right. It is probably up higher, right? Yes. Hike it up higher. Hahaha. [Music playing] Well good morning. We are feeling well rested from last night's party. I don't know about you Sam but I slept really well. Like a log with that fresh country air. Yep. So yeah, we're well rested. We're going to have breakfast now. I hear pancakes are on the menu. And then after that we'll be saying goodbye to our home stay family and leaving the island and going to visit yet another island. So yeah, we've got a full day ahead and let's go eat. Because I'm hungry for pancakes. Alright, so it is a new day and we are visiting a new island. Yes, this is our last stop on Lake Titicaca. This is Taquile Island and we're just going to take a wander around and see what we find. Yes, maybe we'll find our guide and she can tell us a bit of the history of the place. Let's go find her. Just when you think the island couldn't possibly get any steeper it does. I'm still out of breathe because of the high altitude here. And we need to climb a bit further, so let's go. So the interesting thing about this island is that the men are responsible for the knitting instead of the women. So we're just going to head in to the little studio and see them at work. Chugga, chugga, chugga, chug. You can hear the boat's engine. You sure can. So, we have spent the last two days traveling around Lake Titicaca and visiting some of the different islands and the communities that live there. And yeah, we hope you enjoyed this video and you got a little taste of the region. We really had a great time here and I think that wraps up our video. It does and one more thing to add is that if you do have the time make sure you do a several day tour. If you were to try and do it all in one day that would be super rushed. Yeah, tah tah! Many travelers to Peru tend to skip over Lima as they rush off to more scenic destinations, but we’re of the opinion that the capital has a lot to offer. As one of the largest cities in South America, Lima can be a little chaotic and crowded, but it is also full of surprises, especially in terms of culinary experiences and historic attractions. In this travel video guide, we’re going to take you on a tour of the city and show you 30 things to do in Lima, Peru. Now let’s get started! So we are currently at the Love Park. And are you feeling the love? I'm feeling the love. Plant one on here then. Let's show you around. There we go. Mmmhhhmmm. The love park is a beautiful park located in the neighborhood of Miraflores that looks out onto the Pacific Ocean. Due to its name, it’s a popular spot with couples out on a date, especially around sunset when you get spectacular views. If you’re up for a little bit of adventure, you can also go paragliding. You don’t need to have any experience since they offer tandem flights. And even if this doesn’t seem like your type of activity, it’s still pretty cool to go as a spectator to watch people take off the cliff. We come to this restaurant pretty often whenever we're in Lima. This place is called Punto Azul and they make a delicious ceviche and some pretty tasty dishes that we're going to be sampling today. We're actually ordering all of our favorite dishes at this restaurant, so it should be a tasty meal. So I ordered the exact same thing every time I come to Punto Azul. Cebiche. And that has just arrived over here. This is just the classic ceviche. It is only fish, no other seafood in there and we've got our red onions. I also asked for it spicy so you can see the red peppers here. It has kind of been crushed. You still get some big chunks. Um, you have your sweet potato, fresh corn and of course the tiger's milk. Which is basically like a lemon base that helps cure the fish. So yeah, this is my absolute favorite. I never get sick of ceviche. My mouth just waters thinking about it. Oh my gosh. So let's dig in. Let's try it. Let's grab some onions in there as well. It is just so good. Wow. I just love all of the flavors in your mouth. Like it is so sour and tart but then you've got your sweet potato to kind of help balance that. It is just perfection. The perfect meal in Lima. Hands down my favorite Peruvian dish. Love it. And now it is time for your favorite. Yes, and you can't come Punto Azul and not indulge in the seafood but I'm trying something that is kind of unique to here and that is the shrimp cheese risotto. Guys, this is to die for. Look at that. Look at how cheesy that is. I'm grabbing a nice big shrimp here. It is so creamy. It is so creamy. This rivals the risottos you find in Italy. I kid you not. Watch out Italy. Mmmmmm. It is just so so so cheesy and then you have the shrimp and then you have all of the different seasonings. Like to me this is my favorite dish in Lima right now. I don't think you got a shrimp. Let's grab one. Yes, I did but I'm going to get a bigger one this time. Mmmmm. Awesome. For a little bit of magic, another fun activity to try at night is to go to Parque de la Reserva for their water circuit and light show. It’s a popular activity with families, but it can be enjoyed by all ages. So dinner time here in Lima and tonight we are going out for anticuchos, which are cow hearts. I know this sounds a little bit unusual but it is actually really tasty so we've come to a popular place. It is called La Grimanesa, we've already placed our order. Let's go get our cow heart. So this place that we're visiting it actually started as a little street stand, so the women who opened the restaurant used to have a little cart and she used to sell her anticuchos on the street and she had a super long line because her food was delicious. She was really popular. And eventually she was able to save up enough money to open a little restaurant here in the neighborhood. So yeah, humble beginnings, but you know the recipe was great so here we are today. So here we have it. The star of the meal. This is my anticuchos. It doesn't really look like a cow's heart in my opinion. I mean, you could food me and tell me this is steak but I'm going to have my first bite. I'm not sure how to do this. Honestly, it's a fairly tender meat. It doesn't have a lot of fat. It could pass off as steak. If no one told you this is a cow's heart you would never know. Your turn. Time for my first bite. I'm going to try some of the sauces here. I think we have a red spicy one and a green one. Oh, that is so so good. And that is really spicy sauce. Wow. You know the meat is really well seasoned so it takes on the flavor of whatever they've used. Like the heart it doesn't taste like an organ. I know exactly, normally when I have organs they're really tough and chewy but this is as nice of a tender cut of meat as you can find. We're checking out Barranco which is a very artsy neighborhood. Apparently, this used to be like a bohemian hangout back in the 60s. So we're just going to go explore on foot. We don't really know what to expect but so far we are seeing lots of street art and looks pretty cool. So we have now been walking around Barranco for a while and we have finally come across the main attraction in this neighborhood. We are standing in front of the bridge of sighs. A really romantic spot for young couples. Apparently, this bridge has made lots of appearances in Peruvian songs and poetry. So yeah, lots of romance happening over here. Let's take a walk. So that was a fun little introduction to Barranco. What did you think of the place? Yeah, this neighborhood is a fun, artsy kind of area. We only spent a couple of hours here in the afternoon. It would be really cool to come at night and see what the nightlife is all about. Yeah, they have lots of bars and restaurants worth checking out. Yeah, it definitely seems that way. Yes. Huaca Pucllana is a giant adobe and clay pyramid located in the middle of Miraflores. Since this site is still under excavation, you can only visit accompanied by a guide, but this is a good thing since you end up learning a lot of the history and culture behind this place. So for today's meal we are going for more of an upscale dining experience. We are having lunch at a place called La Rosa Náutica, which means the nautical rose. And it is a really cool restaurant out on the water. There is this pier built over the ocean and it just leads you all the way to this little restaurant. So you're like surrounded by waves, there is surfers, birds. Perfect setting and the food here is really good. I've been here once before many many years ago. So I'm excited to come back with more mature taste buds. Being the foodies that we are, we made sure to order 2 different sampler plates so that we could try a little bit of everything. We ended up having 3 different types of ceviche, as well as causa, lomo saltado, tacu tacu and more. If you’re looking for a fancy meal out, this place is it! Larcomar is a shopping centre with the best views in all of Lima. The place was built into the cliff overlooking the ocean, and it has cafes and restaurants with outdoor seating areas. In terms of shopping, most of the brands here are on the higher end and the prices reflect so. So it is a super hot summer day here in Lima. So Sam and I have stopped off for cremoladas which is kind of like a shaved ice drink. And I've gotten one that is flavored like passion fruit. So it is nice and sour. And what is that called locally? Mmm. This is maracuyá. And it is so good. Like, we are dripping sweat right now so this nice frozen drink is exactly what we need. Mmmmm. And for yours? And I'm having my favorite cremolada. It is called lúcuma. It is a local fruit to Peru and I haven't had it anywhere else in the world. It is absolutely delicious. That is good stuff isn't it? There is no better way to cool off. Another activity you can try in Lima is surfing. There are lots of surf shops along the water, so it’s just a matter of inquiring about rates for surf lessons and board rentals. Okay, so for today's lunch we are eating at a place called Taiken and they specialize in Nikkei food. Now this is something that I hadn't heard of until I came to Peru but apparently Peru has the second largest Japanese population in all of South America. And that has really influenced the cuisine. So Nikkei is the combination of Peruvian and Japanese culinary inspiration. So yeah, we're going to be trying some Japanese Peruvian food today. Okay, so this right here is Pejerrey tempura. Tempura time. And this is basically the local catch. Which makes it. And this sauce is really unique because normally when I've had a dipping sauce, like when I'm having Japanese food, it is typically cold. And this is piping hot. You can actually see the steam coming off of it. Whoops! Butter fingers over here. Butter fingers over here. Alright, we're going to attempt to save this here. Mmmm. Wow. You know whenever I've had tempura at a Japanese restaurant it has always been vegetables. This is amazing. Like this is almost reminds me a little bit sort of like fish and chips except it is a lot thinner. Oh, it is just so tasty. The tempura batter is really really good. And then the fish is really fresh. So yeah, typically when I've had tempura too it tends to be something like sweet potato or other kinds of vegetables but wow does it ever taste delicious in fish form. In fish form. So it is basically deep-fried fish in a batter. Basically, that is what I'm saying. Let's get a close-up. Interesting. Are you going to eat it? There you go. Okay, so next up we're going to dig in to the maki rolls. And this one right here has breaded shrimp and avocado and a little bit of fish on top. And I'm not entirely sure what the sauce or the powder is. So maybe dip it in a bit of soy. Mmmmm. Oh wow. Tasty? That is really nice. Okay, one second to chew this. So, when we ordered this one off of the menu we saw that it said acevichado which kind of sounds like Ceviche and if you try this fish you'll be able to tell that it has been cured in lime and it just has a very zesty fresh flavor. You actually don't even need the soy sauce because it is so flavorful on its own. And I'm still not entirely sure about the green powder but I do like it. So yeah, that is like a really interesting twist on sushi because you have the ceviche influence coming through. So pretty cool. Plaza Mayor, also known as Plaza de Armas, is located in the city centre. The square is flanked by many historic buildings and if you’re looking for colonial architecture, this is the place to find it. The San Francisco Monastery is located just a few blocks away from the main plaza, and it’s another site you won’t want to miss. You can only visit as part of a guided tour, but inside you’ll find a library with antique texts, paintings from the days of the early colony, and catacombs which contain thousands of skulls and bones. So it is time for another lunch video here in Lima. Today we're filming downtown. So we popped into one of the few restaurants that was willing to serve us lunch at eleven am because we're already starved and you know when we're hungry we get hangry. So here we are, we're going to be filming a video about ocopa a la arequipeña and Papa a la Huancaína. Both are potato dishes served with sauces which are kind of similar but from different regions. So we'll be sampling those. So the dish Sam is trying, Papa a la Huancaína, originated in the province of huancayo and that is how it gets its name. Yeah, so let's talk about the ingredients here. So the main thing here is the sauce. I mean of course this is a potato dish but this is a sauce that is made out of cheese, milk and rocoto. And rocoto that is the yellow aji pepper. Yeah, exactly. And this is something we're very familiar with because it is often served at your Aunt's and Grandma's house. So we love this dish. Wow. Good stuff? This is easily one of my favorite Peruvian dishes. Like I just love this sauce and then Peruvian potatoes are some of the best in the world, so it is like you're combining this amazing sauce on top of really well prepared potatoes. That is amazing. And the cool thing about this dish is that you can find it just about everywhere in Peru. You can find this along the coast, in the Sierras and even in the jungle. So yeah, and speaking of presentation this is usually served with black olives and hard boiled eggs. And these are small eggs. I think these are quail eggs because they're quite little. So do you like it? Oh yeah. Maybe I won't be sharing after all. So it is now time to try the second potato dish and that is ocopa a la arequipeña. If you have a look here we can see the plate and it is a little bit different from the previous one. This sauce is a little bit more green. But it is still served with a hard boiled eggs and the black olives. And the two main ingredients to make this sauce are aji and huacatay. No idea what huacatay is. I have never seen this before. No clue. Not very familiar with the food here in Peru. Um, but aside from that the sauce also has a bit of onions, garlic, milk, fresh cheese, some crumbled crackers and peanuts so it should be a bit more crunchy than the one we had earlier. So I'm going to grab a spoon here. It is time to serve yourself. Help myself. Serve yourself up. There we go. Let's grab a bit more sauce so you can really taste it. Alright, time to dig in. Yeah. Oh, and one thing worth noting. If you don't want to go through the trouble of making the sauce from scratch. You can go to the supermarket here in Peru and they sell these little packs that have the powder already pre-made. And you just have to like add a little bit of milk and water and viola! Instant sauce out of the bag. But let's try this. Mmmmmm. So yeah, so this one is a bit sweeter than the one we had earlier. A lot sweeter actually. A lot sweeter. Wow. In the past when I've had it at my family's place it is a bit more crunchy. Because I guess they don't really chop their peanuts that finely so you can still kind of taste them. But this one is very smooth and very creamy. And it is a bit spicier than the Huancaína we had earlier. So it is kind of spicy and sweet. It is good. It is good but I still prefer Papa a la Huancaína. That is just a classic. Another place to visit in Lima’s historic centre is the main cathedral. They offer a guided tour, which is very informative, and you can also climb down into the crypt beneath the church. Just down the street from the Cathedral you’ll find the Government Palace. If you time your visit just right, you’ll be able to watch the changing of the guard. Unfortunately, we had just missed it! So it is past twelve noon which I think means it is acceptable to get a little boozy. We are going to be doing a taste test of Pisco Sour versus Chilcano. Both drinks are made with Pisco but they are quite different so those should be coming soon. So the cocktail has arrived. This is the Pisco Sour. Yes. And this is my all-time favorite Peruvian drink. It is amazing. I can't wait to try it here. So how does it taste? As you might imagine. It is sour. But also quite sweet. Yeah. So, the Pisco Sour is made from a number of different ingredients so you've got your grape brandy the Pisco which actually comes from the town of Pisco here in Peru. Yeah. Then you've got your egg white on top. If you take a look down here you've got your egg white on top, a little bit of bitter which is the brown. Nice and frothy. Yes, that is the key. And then here you also have lemon or lime juice and often a little bit of syrup added to give it some extra bit of sugar. Extra bit of sweet. So that is one very sweet cocktail. Very refreshing on a hot day. Yeah, and this is considered the National drink of Peru. Mixing it all up with my little seahorse. So I ordered the Chilcano and this is a cocktail that is made with Pisco, ginger ale and a little bit of lime juice. You know who would really like this? Would be my Mom. She loves ginger ale. That is a little stronger than I was expecting. Potent. Potent. I was hoping it would be a little bit watered down with all of the ice cubes but no that is definitely got Pisco in there and you can taste it. It burns on the way down. I might need to help you out with that one huh? Actually, the first time we tried Chilcanos it was in Cusco, we thought we were going to a Pisco museum but when we got there it was actually more like a bar. So we ordered I think it was like four different Chilcanos with different flavors. So that was pretty cool. This one that I'm having right now is just the classic. Basically ginger ale, lime and Pisco. But you can get fancy and like make strawberry ones, cinnamon ones and just you know different flavors. So one of our favorite things to do in Lima whenever we're in the city is to come to Kennedy Park. And they have so many stray cats that are taken care of by the locals. You can buy a little bit of cat food and feed them and play with them. And they're all really friendly. For us the cats are the main attraction, however, aside from that, the park also hosts an outdoor hippie fair which is worth checking out. That, or just go play with the cats! So it is dinnertime here in Lima and we are at a place called La Lucha which specializes in sandwiches so we've ordered a Chicharrón sandwich which is like a fried pork. It should be really tasty. We are waiting for our food to get here. And yeah, let's get started. So our food has arrived. Yeah we've got our Pan con Chicharrón. It's looking good. It looks amazing. If you look down here you really get a good tour of what we have. So we've got a bun and inside it looks like we've got lots of onion. I'm guessing it is sweet onion. Yeah. Then we have the fried pork and then the kamote - the sweet potato. Exactly. So that looks like a pretty awesome sandwich. Let's try it now. Yes. Is it ready? Alright, it is my first bite. Mmmm. It's so good. It's so good. You know what really makes a sandwich. I mean the meat is awesome it is really good quality but it is the sweet potato. I love having sweet potato in my sandwich. That's an unusual ingredient but it works doesn't it? It does. Lima’s Mercado Indio is located along Petit Thouars, and this is where visitors can come to do all their souvenir shopping. Whether it’s alpaca sweaters, chess sets, warm slippers, or silver jewelry you’re after, you can find it all here. It is lunchtime again here in Lima and today we are going to be trying a traditional dish called Ají de gallina. This is probably like one of those national dishes that you can find at almost any restaurant. But we're eating it at a place called Republica which makes Peruvian dishes but kind of like in a casual fast food setting. So yeah, it should be interesting. We've placed our order and that should be coming soon. Okay, so the food is already here. That came very quickly. So let's have a look at the plate. This is Ají de gallina and as you can see it is kind of like a chicken stew. It is made with shredded chicken and the sauce has a cream, cheese and peanut base. And also the way they thicken this sauce is by adding bread crumbs that have been soaked in either a broth or milk and this is served with rice or boiled potatoes. And the boiled potatoes and kind of hiding underneath all of the chicken here. Oh, we do have boiled potatoes. We do. Yeah. I thought we were just given rice. So this is a very hearty meal. I'm kind of glad we're sharing one plate because there is no way I could eat all of this. Um, but yeah, let's dig right in. I'm just going to try it with rice here. Look at that. This looks so good. This is one of my favorite ways that chicken is prepared here in Peru. I love this dish. Mmmmhmmm. And, I don't know if I forgot to mention this but another key ingredient is Aji. The hot pepper. But because it has a cream base it is not super spicy. So I really love this. Look, they actually gave us aji sauce too. In case we want it spicier. Maybe we should add a little bit. In case it wasn't enough. Yeah, just dunk it all over that rice. I'm not sure if that is how it is done but that is how we do it. So let's see if that has more kick now. Another quality control bite. Quality control. That is what we call it. Mmmmm. Now it is spicier. That is good. Nice and creamy too? Feel the burn. Lima’s beaches are very pebbly and the waters are rather cold, but that doesn’t keep beach goers away. If you just want to sunbathe or cool off with a quick dip, the beaches fit the bill. So for today's lunch in Lima we are going to be having Chifa. And that is basically Chinese food with a Peruvian twist. So you know how we always visit a country maybe even Canada or the US and you go to a Chinese buffet and you're like mmmm this is delicious and then you go to China and you can't find any of the dishes you had at a Chinese buffet. That is because Chinese food really varies from one country to the next because incorporate you know their spices and their cooking styles. So Peruvian Chinese food is quite distinct. We're going to be eating Chifa which literally means to eat rice. So yeah, we've ordered a lot of food that is going to be coming soon and it should be interesting. Peruvian Chinese food. Apparently there are more than 6000 chifa restaurants spread out across Lima, so we can assure you that you won’t have any trouble finding one. On the contrary, it might be kind of hard to choose just one! If you want to see what a local market looks like, head over to Mercado de Surquillo. You’ll find lots of fresh produce here, and it’s particularly busy if you come in the early morning. They also have little stands where you can grab a bite if you get hungry. So for today's video we are at a place called Sanguchisimo and we're going to be eating salchipapas by popular demand. We had all of these people being like if you're in Lima you have to eat salchipapa. So we listened to you, we tracked down this place and we're excited to be trying this dish. So our choripapas and salchipapas have arrived. We've got the sausage one and the hot dog one. Look at those portions. That is a thing of beauty. And this is a street food snack that originated in the streets of Lima. But now it has spread all over Latin America so you can find it in other countries which is pretty cool. Different variations everywhere. And it comes with four different sausages that we've got here on this plate. We've got ketchup, mayo, mustard and of course aji. I think the aji is my favorite one. Yes, mine too. So we may need to ask for an extra container. And this is like a really nice spicy sauce that you'll find almost everywhere in Peru. It is always a staple at the table. So yeah, I'm really looking forward to digging in to this. It looks fantastic. So let's just go for it. So on top here we have. Look at all of that cheese! Yeah, that is a lot of cheese and some fried egg as well. And when we were placing our order they asked us do you want your egg like well fried or do you want it a little bit runny. And there is nothing that grosses out Sam more than runny eggs so we got ours well done sunny side up. So yeah, I kind of like my eggs runny. I like them juicy. I don't like my runny eggs. It grosses me out when the yolk bursts. Yeah. Sam is always like take it away. I can't look at the plate. Take it away. But anyways, I've got a little bit of everything on here. My French Fry, my hot dog, my egg and cheese. Look at the sauce. And yes let's dip it into the aji. Can't forget that. Load up on that aji. That is a massive bite. Ugh. Hot. Aw! A little messy. Wow. That is good. Give me one minute. This is wonderful. If I were a kid I feel like I would want to eat this everyday. I would be like Mom, please salchipapa for lunch. It is really good. It is really hot. I just burned my mouth when I took that first bite. But look at that. Yeah, it has got a lot of ingredients that kids would love. Yeah. You've got your french fries, you've got your cheese, you've got your eggs, you've got your hot dog, you've got your nice sauces. That is ticking off a lot of boxes for sure. It is wonderful. And I have to say the aji at this restaurant is actually really spicy. It is the spiciest which I've had. So right now we are visiting Park Maria Reiche. Which is a real cool park where they've recreated the Nazca lines using flowers and different plants. So if you don't want to go all the way down to Nazca, and you don't want to fly in one of those tiny planes, you can come here and kind of get an idea what the Nazca lines look like. I mean these are obviously much smaller. If you have a bit of a sweet tooth, you’ll certainly enjoy diving into Peruvian desserts. There are a few classics that you simple shouldn’t miss, including: Suspiro a la limeña and Merengado de chirimoya. Another fun way to experience the city is by bike. Head down to the boardwalk where you can hire a bicycle for a few hours and bike the length of the coast. So it is time for another food video and today we are going to be trying something that is called Causa. Causa, it is kind of like a shepherds pie if you haven't tried it before, it is made with yellow mashed potato and you can get lots of different fillings. So we've ordered two different varieties and that should be coming soon and it is going to be delicious. I love the causa. So the causa has arrived and it is a thing of beauty. How excited are you for your food, Sam? Yeah, it looks like artwork. I almost feel guilty tucking in to it. Almost. Okay, so let's talk about the key ingredients that make up causa. So you have your yellow potato, lime and aji which is the yellow hot pepper. Yeah. And in terms of fillings you can have lots of different ones. So Sam went with the classic which has. Mine has chicken and you can also see that there is some avocado here on the side as well. And that looks like some mayo. A mayo sauce on top. I'm just going to dig right in. I'm going right to the bottom. It is like cutting into a tower. Wow. That is really good. Yeah? Yeah. And with this particular causa it is really salty. You can tell they've added a lot of salt to it. But it just like, when you get that much yellow potatoes, it is just oh man it is so good. It is almost like having Mom's mashed potatoes back home or something but with much better dressings. With the chicken and the sauce and the avocado. Oh man, that is good. Okay and let's talk about the chicken. Is it shredded chicken? Like the one we had in Aji de Gallina or is it chopped. It is shredded chicken. Yeah. Okay. One more bite for quality control. Research purposes. That is good stuff. And I am beyond excited for mine because I saw Causa Acevichado on the menu and that is a ceviche causa. Look at that. Woah. So I've got my fish, a little bit of fish that has been kind of cooked in lime. I have my red onions, I have my hot chili peppers and of course my yellow mashed potato with a bit of mayo. Super fancy over there. I know. And if you know how much I love ceviche this is just the perfect dish for me really. You're doing a good job of toppling it already. I don't know why but I'm blowing on my food. That is such a habit. It is cold. It is a cold dish. Mmmmm. Oh, yeah. The best of both worlds? It is so good. The lime. So much lime. And it is so tangy. And a little spicy. With those little pieces of red hot chili. Mmmmm. This is my favorite. I haven't even tried yours but I know this is my favorite. Mmmmm. And that’s a wrap for the Peruvian capital. We had a wonderful time visiting Lima and we hope that you’ll consider adding this destination to your travel bucket list if you come to Peru. As always, if you have any other suggestions of delicious foods to try, or cool things to do in Lima that we may not have mentioned, feel free to share those with travellers in the comments below. For more food and travel videos from around the world, be sure to hit subscribe! After spending some time in Lima, we flew into Iquitos for the final leg of our Peruvian adventure. The landscape changed from arid deserts to mountains and finally to jungle as our flight crossed the country, and once we arrived, the first thing we did was hop into a tuk-tuk to take us into the city. So we have made it to Iquitos. We had some lunch, we had a nap. It is now time to explore but first up we have to show you our hotel. It is called Hotel Epoca and it is super cool. It is a colonial building with a cute terrace and you just have to see it. So let's go. I know. So they have some cool historical photographs along here. Let me show you my favorite. This right here Iquitos in the 1920s. Flapper culture at its finest. How cool is that? And I like this one. Fancy. Looks very posh. Drinking coffee on the balcony. Iquitos is a really fascinating city. It is the largest city in the world that cannot be reached by road, which means that if you want to visit, you either have to take a plane or a boat to get there. For many, Iquitos is just a quick stopover en route to an Amazon river cruise or a jungle stay, however, we were pretty excited to get to explore this colonial city. So favorite part of the city so far is walking along the riverfront. We've got the Rio Amazonas just over there. And it is a really scenic walk. It is, it reminds us so much of Luang Prabang in Laos. Yes. Like it is bringing us right back. So similar. Rrrrrr. We can hear those engines purring. Yes, something that also reminds us so much of Southeast Asia is all of the tuk-tuk. It is a city of tuk-tuk. You see motorcycles and rickshaw drivers everywhere. And right behind us is a really cool building. It is an Iron House and that was built by Gustav Eiffel and brought piece by piece all the way from France in 1890. Wow! Or so rumor has it! There is little evidence tying Eiffel to this building, but the mystery keeps people visiting. We spent the rest of the afternoon just wandering around Iquitos on foot. We didn’t have a map and we didn't have a guide, but we somehow managed to hit a lot of the main landmarks and then some. Well I would say it has been a pretty fun first half day of exploration. We're really enjoying the town so far. Yes. This is a place I have wanted to visit for such a long time because my Grandma is actually from this area. Not from the city but from like a tiny little colony in the middle of the jungle that no longer even exists. I know. So it is pretty cool here. I feel like we have a much greater appreciation of where she is from and the kinds of food she has been eating because if you stay tune to our channel we're going to be filming a lot of food vlogs of all the regional cuisine from the Amazon. Yes. And right now you can probably tell we're like sweating profusely. Yeah, so we found a little juice bar with a really great view and we're just going to wait for the sun to set. Yeah, and wait for our smoothies to arrive. How are you feeling? Well, I'm feeling pretty awesome. I mean we've had a really good start to our time here in Iquitos. I think we've found our bearings and we've witnessed a really cool sunset. So tomorrow is a new day and we're going to explore a whole bunch more. We're hoping to visit maybe the water stilt village tomorrow. Good morning. Good morning. We woke-up this morning with the intention of filming sunrise but it was pouring rain. It was pouring rain. No sunrise whatsoever. So we went back to bed and now we're going for breakfast. Breakfast. And these are the views from our hotel. Yeah, and as you can see it is still quite wet outside from the rain this morning. Some motorcycle and tuk-tuk traffic happening. And it appears we're not the only ones going for breakfast. There is like a dog and birds feasting on this huge pile of trash outside. They almost look like vultures but I'm not sure they are. So this right here is our breakfast. We have some bread with jam and butter and scrambled eggs and fresh fruits, tea, coffee, juice and I think Sam is extra excited because he is finally getting fresh fruits after how long? It's been a very long time. It has been a while huh? So it looks like you've got banana and watermelon and papaya. And papaya. Ooh. Not a bad trio. So we're going out for a little bit of sightseeing. And Sam has undergone quite the transformation since breakfast. So I'm no longer wolverine. I'm a little bit more clean shaven. Every time I do this I feel like a whole new man. Like I've just got to come up with a better routine where I am shaving say like once a week instead of once every six weeks. Plus it is a little too hot here to be sporting a beard. Exactly, I had like the greasiest face of all-time yesterday. So I was like it is time to make a change. So, clean-shaven and let's go check out the stilt village. Let's go. Okay, so we made it to Belen which is the little village on water stilts. It is pretty cool. But what Sam and I are finding fascinating is a little paths that lead off of this path. Like, we need to show you one place. It is basically this plank that you have to walk to reach your home. Yeah, it is right nearby so lead the way. And if you don't have good balance you could totally fall over. I know I would. You know what I'm getting sweaty palms just looking at this. Look at this. Could you imagine if that were the entrance to your home. That is like a foot and a half wide. If that? If that? Walk the plank. Walk the plank. We ended up in the more residential area of Belen, however, there is a more touristy area where you can hire a peke-peke boat to take you out on the water. While we didn’t get to experience this, it could be a cool way to see the village from a different vantage point. So how was our mission to find the banana chips? The chifles. Speaking Spanish. Okay, so apparently we found another spot to do it. Chifles. Cool, so finding chifles take two right? Ah, esta bien gracias. So what is the deal? No chifle we're going to keep looking. Puppy. Oh, meow meows. No food meowzers. So next up it is market time. I am wishing I wore shoes because it is looking pretty muddy and I've got flip flops. So Audrey, what are you seeing so far? Mostly fresh produce. Fruits and vegetables. Lots of colorful fruit. And I can smell cilantro in the air. Sleepy kitty. So we just went through a really busy market. Now we're heading back into a different section of the water stilt village. What's the little pup doing? What's it doing? Cats. Cats. Cats. So that is a wrap from Iquitos. Tomorrow we are off to stay in a tree house lodge in the middle of the jungle. And from there we're going to be cruising down the Amazon. Yeah. Can't wait for that. So the adventures continue and we'll have many more videos to come. Ciao. Ciao. So we are staying in the coolest place ever. We have just arrived at the Tree House Lodge in the middle of the Amazon jungle. And we're going to be living in a tree house for the next few days. So come along and I'm going to show you our personal private tree house. This way. Around the tree trunk. Come up. And our favorite part is closing the door. Yes, no one else is allowed in. Just the two of us. Just the two of us. There we go. So now it is time for the grand tour. So this is the bed. I feel like I'm on an episode of MTV cribs. This is the bed. Check it out. Mosquito net. Nice and big. It kind of has a jungle theme with the pillows. We've kind of already made it messy. We have a chocolate we haven't had yet. And we have a little living area. That is all of our luggage. Tada. And what else can we show you? The bathroom. There is no door to the bathroom. And guys just look at this tree trunk. I'm like going around it here. Yeah. There we go. So we've got out toilet on this side. A little glass sink. And then our shower stall. Just on the other side. That is pretty cool. And we're living in a tree house! We're living in a tree house! Every kids dream. Yes. So, status update. Okay, well we want to show you more of the property but right now we're about to head out on a jungle walk. We're going to be looking for medicinal plants and learning about their uses. It also just started pouring rain so that is going to be interesting. But anyways let's get going. We need to go. Go go go. Let's open our door. Open the trap door. Open sesame. Open the trapdoor. That's heavy. Scary. So it is time for our jungle expedition. And we have to cross this bridge to get back to the main area. Right over here. Let's go meet our guide. So Sam, you look like you're ready for a jungle excursion. Show us your footwear. I've got a surprise. Check this out. Da Doh. He's ready. And this is probably the most awkward jig because these are about three times too big for me. Same here. I'm wearing 44 for me. It'll be fun. We'll make use of it. So this is the tallest tree house of the property. Wow! What have you got in your hand Audrey? So this is pichirina. Apparently it is the jungle's iodine. And to me it smells like mango. (Speaking Spanish.) Si, no. To treat ringworm. Ringworm. So you just rub it? You use it. Look. Oh. Look. Put it. And here is the leaf that is used to make the Juane. The traditional food from the Amazon jungle here in Peru. This here is the blood mushroom. As you can see it is red. And it is not edible guys. So don't you go eating it. Whistle for us. So we are back from the jungle excursion. Yeah, that jungle walk was awesome. We learned so much about all of the different local plants and what they are used for in terms of different medicinal properties and also for food. And now we're off on a cool boat trip. We're just going to be cruising down the Amazon and looking for pink dolphins. Yes and maybe we'll stick around for sunset too. We'll see. So here is our sweet ride. The captain. Capitano. Senor Andres. Macau look! Squak. So we just spotted a sloth up in the tree. We wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't for our guide though. And this is sunset on the Amazon river. So that is the end of day one. How are you feeling about sleeping in this tree house? It is awesome. I love the room. Um, we're exhausted. We had a really really busy day. We sure did. A lot of adventure. And tomorrow we're really looking forward to showing you more of the property and also doing a couple more tours as well. So another busy day ahead. Can't wait for that to happen. Goodnight. Time to crawl into bed. Crawl into your little net. There it is. Hahaha. Goodnight little one. Well, good morning it is the start of day two and it was sure raining last night. Like thunderstorms, the whole deal. But that really added to the atmosphere. So anyways, we're going to go for breakfast and because it is wet I'm not sure what we can do this morning but hopefully we can get out and do a couple excursions. So it is 9 am and we are back on the water and it is a beautiful morning to be out. We're going to try and spot some wildlife. Ooh! We found something. Oh wow. We went out for a little excursion this morning and we've been traveling upstream and now we've arrived at a prime location to fish piranhas. So Sam, how are you feeling about that? Feeling good because you're going to stick your fingers in and they're going to bite them, right? What? Just kidding we actually have fishing rods. And there is the bait. I don't wanna use my fingers. Hahahaha. So we've going to use this small fish. Oh! To feed the piranha. You want to try to splash the water. That is the way how to attract the piraña. Splashing the water. Calling the piranha. Come over! Okay, so I'm going try my hand at fishing for piranhas. I've got the bait here. Right here. Let's do this. Oh oh. I feel a tug. No they just ate half the fish. They ate half of the fish. Yeah! Oh look we got our first one. Look at that. Our first piraña. Look at the teeth on that sucker. Oh my gosh I would not want to be bitten by one of those. What do you think Audrey? That is scary. Looks like something out of a horror movie. Yeah, oh no. Hahahaha. Almost. You got one! You got one! Show it to us. I finally caught one. It was a big one too. Film it. I am. Grab it from here. Wow! It is not going to move. Don't worry. Wow! Check this out. There you go. Sam's first piranha. Look at that. Probably my 20th attempt and I was not going to give up until I got one. There it is. Congratulations. There is dinner. There is dinner. So mission accomplished. Time to head back for lunch but we're going to be having these for dinner. So that is pretty exciting. So we just came back. Now it is time for lunch. So what are we having? We are having ceviche. Our favorite as an appetizer. Wow, look at that. The corn of course. Oops. Dig right in. There we go. Have a nice big piece. Mmmmm. Is that some good ceviche? Mmmmm. Try it. So we are about to go on one more excursion this evening but before we head out we want to show you the rest of the property. So let's go in search of some tree houses. This way. We are now entering the bamboo forest. So Sam I think you lucked out with our tree house because we only have to cross one bridge. Yeah but that bridge is kind of freaky for me. I think I would prefer the stairs. That is really only the difference between these two places. Also think this tree house is higher up than ours too. Oh, vertigo! Wow! Oh! Oh! Are they fighting? Yeah. Squack. Alright, so Sam is going to feed a monkey. Yes, I've got my chunk of banana. Now time to throw it. Let's see your best baseball swing. So right now we are trekking through the mud in search of giant lily pads. As you can probably hear it is pretty squishy. So we are meeting a sloth that was apparently rescued by a family when it was really young. So it lives with them in the house and it is very sleepy and slow. So oh, but it has woken up. It is eating. Pablito? Pablito. Pablito! Pablito is having lunch. Pablito. While he is thinking about it anyway. Are you going to eat Pablito? Check those out. Okay so this morning we went fishing for piranha and now we are having it for dinner. And that is the big one I caught. Yeah, Sam got the big one. The grande. So how are we going to dig into this? Begin. Hahaha. So it came served in an orange. A little bit of meat. That is surprisingly decent. Yeah? Yeah. There doesn't appear to be a whole lot of meat there. No there is not. Hello from the shores of the Amazon river. This is a pretty cool place to be wouldn't you say? Yeah, this is a bucketlist item for us definitely. So we are currently cruising down the Amazon with Rainforest Cruises. We're going to be spending four days and three nights aboard the Delfin number one. Yeah, and it is a very luxurious boat. We're doing this in style. It is awesome. We're going to give you a tour of the boat and we'd also like to show you some of the really cool excursions that we're going to be doing over these next three to four days. So come along. Let's go. This feels like yet another episode of MTV cribs. But come on in. We are staying in the Anaconda suite. Pretty cool. No anaconda sighted so far. But basically this is our little terrace. We have a nice balcony with views of the Amazon river. And yeah we can just hang out here, have drinks, read a book, it is pretty cool. I like it. Alright, and let's check out the inside of our room. Okay. So I have to admit we've already unpacked. So it is not quite as tidy as it was. Well are we ever tidy? Come on. Hahaha. Come on. So this is the room. This is where we are staying. You've got the bed, a little living area. My laptop is off there in the distance. Our electronics are scattered around. Yep. And the bathroom is just over this way. Tada. Hi. So I would say this is our favorite area. The common room. Yes. It doesn't get much more relaxing than the common area here. We've got all of these pillows and check out the cool display of bananas and plantains. Some plantains. Yes. And the Amazon. The Amazon river is right there. And if you want to lounge like a lizard just head over to the bar over there. Check that out. And this is a pretty swanky bar. But you know what, I think I'm in the mood for a game of chess. So Sam, I challenge you. So right now I'm going to challenge Sam to a game of chess. We've only played chess twice. And you've never won. I've never won. So let's see if the third time is a charm. Team Audrey! Pwew. Yeah! Yeah! Well, it would appear Sam has emerged victorious. I only had one piece left. My King. That was it. That was my third win against Audrey. So if you're placing bets on one of the two of us you should probably go with me. Our first afternoon aboard our Amazon Cruise was pretty relaxed. After settling into our rooms we had some free time to enjoy the boat, and as the sun was beginning to make its way down, we made our way up to the top deck where we got to witness one of the most spectacular sunsets ever. The following morning called for an early start with everyone ready to board the skiff by 6:30 a.m. Our guide had lured us with the promise of wildlife and a delicious breakfast aboard the boat, and thankfully he delivered on both of those. That morning we saw countless blue and yellow macaws, a school of pink dolphins playfully breaking through the water, and sloths slowly going about their day. As for breakfast, the captain took us to a secluded lagoon covered in a blanket of water lettuce, where we parked the boat and enjoyed a three course breakfast featuring: fruit-kebabs, chicken and avocado salad, and hot sandwiches. It was the perfect way to start off our day on the Amazon. Woah! Hot? I am super sweaty. I'm sure you can probably tell. So I'm enjoying the fan, yeah. So we are back in the jungle. This afternoon we are doing a jungle walking excursion. And we're also going to be doing a canopy walk across a series of suspension bridges. So we're just on the trail. We've got our rubber boots back on. Rubber boots on and I think this walk. I think this walk should be around forty minutes until we reach the bridge. So, yeah. Okay, so you've got your weightlifting gloves on. What is this for Sam? Actually this is because of fire ants. And while we're walking across the suspension bridge we don't want to get any on our hands. Protection. Protection. So we have reached the first of the series of suspension bridges. Are you feeling ready? Ha! As ready as I can ever be. I mean I don't love these but it should be some awesome views. I hate heights. Let's go. Bouncy. How are you feeling with all of the bounce? Not bad. Are you enjoying the bounce Sam? You know what, this one is not very high so I'm not freaked out by it yet. Okay. Wait until the next one. Yeah. We are up in the canopy. It is pretty cool. We've gained quite a bit of height since the first bridge. And now we are on bridge number three. Ooh. This one kind of swings from side to side doesn't it? So this appears to be the last bridge for a while. And I have to say I'm pretty proud of Sam. He's practically Tarzan. Practically Tarzan. He doesn't even like heights. Awww. Hahaha. Yeah, you did well. The courage is all there. Meal times were another highlight of our cruise aboard the Delfin I. They had an international menu sure to satisfy every palate, but they also made sure to use Amazonian ingredients and feature Peruvian-inspired dishes at every meal. Every meal was a delight to our foodie taste buds. So good morning. It is another beautiful day on the Amazon and we've just finished breakfast and we're now heading out on our first excursion of the day. We will be going piranha fishing and if you watched our previous video we already did that at the treehouse; however, I was very unsuccessful while Sam caught the biggest piraña yet. So we're going to try it again and see if maybe I can catch one this time. Okay Sam so we're ready to fish some piranhas? Round two. So here is the rod, here is the bait, it is just a little bit of meat. And so the whole idea here is to put your rod in and make a splashing sound. Like something has just fell into the water. Like an insect or some creature. And that is going to attract the pirañas. And you just wait until you feel a bit of a tug. So 0 for 1 so far today. But I still like my odds because the last time we tried this, when we were doing the fishing with the treehouse, it took me about twenty times to finally catch something so I'm going to be patient again. Okay Sam, so attempt number five at least. This is five or six. Yeah, and you know what, these piranhas appear to be a little smarter over here. Either that or our hooks aren't quite as sharp because I haven't even felt many tugs. They're just coming and gracefully. Oh, I feel something here. Oh, no nothing. Nothing yet. Kind of gracefully. False alarm! False alarm, they're kind of just gracefully taking it off the hook. Oh. Look at that. Look at that. It's gone. It is gone. They ate the bait. Again. Oh. Womp. Womp, womp. Womp. So I've been fired and I've been replaced by wife-y. Wife-y. Hahaha. Let's see if I fare any better. See how wife-y does. Oh. I felt a tug. Oh, no it is gone. My goodness. What! The skill of these piranhas is legendary. Okay Sam, so tell us about the one who got away. So I actually caught it and I was about to bring it in and it got away. But it wasn't a piraña. No it wasn't. It was a little sardine. It was but it was a big fish. It was much bigger than the piranha I caught the other day. So yeah, more fishing failures over here. So we officially ran out of bait for our piranha fishing so we kind of gave up on that activity. But right now we're trying kayaking down one of the smaller tributaries of the Amazon. So this should be fun. Excited? With the fear that if we go overboard that piranhas are going to eat use. Wobble, wobble, wobble. Sam, crap. Just like in Finland. Sam! Hahaha. Gosh. Lead the way brave one. Lead the way. Well I just sit in the back chill out and film, right? Hahaha. Is that how we roll? Apparently when you're in the back and no one is keeping an eye on you. Things just don't happen. Don't get done. So it is super peaceful out here on the water. And I have to say I think this is one of my favorite activities we've done so far. I know, we've kind of really taken to kayaking over the years haven't we? Yeah. Since we first tried it in was it Vietnam or Finland? Vietnam. And then Finland. Now we've done it in Finland, we've also done it in Fredericton. We've done it in Canada. So yeah. Cool. This is something that we're not the most adventurous travelers but this is something we can both do. Hahaha. Right? I'm the captain of this ship. And that is a scary thought. Cruising down the Amazon. So we are about to reach the point where the Ucayali River and the Marañón River meet together to form the Amazon. So that moment calls for a toast. So here is a toast to travels in the Amazon. Salut! Wait, not salud. It is Arriba. Arriba. Abajo. Abajo. Al Centro. Al Centro. Y adentro. Y adentro. Hmmmm. And that is how you do it in the Amazon. Yeah. Alright Sam, do you want to tell us about this afternoon's excursion? Yeah, so we're visiting this cool kind of little local village. It is called Sanfrancisco. San Francisco. And it has only been around since 1974 so it is just over 40 years old. So it is going to be cool to check it out. Uh, we're just going to walk around and see what we find. Yeah. So apparently this village, the reason they started it, is because they were looking for higher ground since the previous village used to flood during the rainy season. So what are you going to do Audrey? Apparently help squeeze sugarcane. I'm going to help squeeze sugarcane. Let's see if I've got talent. Rain sounds.

For today's outing we are at the Noryangjin Fish Market (노량진수산시장). This is my first time here. This is one of the most famous markets in all of Seoul (서울). It is a fish market - a seafood market. And we're going to check it all out. There is six flours if you can believe it. Plus two basement levels. So technically eight. If you can see all of those. Yeah, so lots of fish. I think we're also going to try to eat lunch here. Have some seafood. We've got a lot of exploring to do. So here on the third floor we have the dried fish stores where everything is already pre-packaged. You can take it home and do whatever you do with dry fish. Next up we're going in to the live octopus stores and this is actually considered a delicacy in Korea. You eat the baby octopus while it is still like riggling around. Um, I've never tried it before. I've tried it like once about ten years ago. Oh. It is a fascinating experience. We're not going to do that today. We're just going for some normal fish but if you're up for a challenge then yeah that is something you can consider doing here at this fish market. Live baby octopus. So it seems I can never win at the fish market. The one time I visited a fish market in Busan I remember it was summer, I was wearing flipflops and I ended up getting fish juice all over my toes. It was gross. And this time around I didn't wear proper footwear once again. So the fish juice has been seeping in to my canvas shoes. Now my shoes are wet and I've got fish juice in my socks. This is really nasty and we just got here. We've come down a level to the second floor and this is the fresh fish store level. And we're seeing a lot of fresh fish. We're seeing some huge fish. Huge. They have just about everything here to be honest. They sell rain boots. That is probably a really good idea in a fish market. I'd suggest coming in with rain boots or at least at the very least wearing closed shoes. We are now on the second floor and we have found a whole bunch of restaurants that specialize in Hoe (회) and that is the raw fish. Kind of like sashimi. So we need to choose one. We need to settle on one. So we finally settled on a restaurant. I mean there is a lot to choose from. So we're just walking around and I'm like finally let's make a decision. So we saw that this place had some people and it had some nice traditional seating. So we're like 'yes' let's give it a shot. And it had a relatively affordable menu. Yeah. Because seafood here appears to be quite expensive. Well you can get really expensive seafood. The stuff that we're getting isn't as expensive. We're getting chobap (초밥) which is a kind of basically the best way to explain it is kind of like Korean sushi and we're also getting Hoedeopbap (회덮밥) which is basically sliced raw fish with rice. So we've got those two dishes coming and man I can't wait to have them. So what can you tell us about the Noryangjin Fish Market (노량진수산시장) Sam? Well it is a very fascinating market. Like first off it is massive. It is open 24 hours of the day. Wow. And get this if you want to go see the live auction you've got to be here at three in the morning. Hahaha. No way was that happening. Yeah. We're not quite the ambitious. And the market moves 250 to 300 tonnes of fish and I guess you could call it marine products. Seafood. Yeah. Daily. Every single day. So just imagine that. Yeah. Gamsahamnida. So the banchan (반찬), the side dishes, have arrived at the table and as you might expect we're seeing lots of seafood here or what I think is seafood because it kind of looks familiar. Tour time. Well we've got some kind of seaweed here. That is familiar. We also have the kimchi - the fermented cabbage which is a staple. But then if you look over here this looks like it could be octopus. Yeah? Yeah, it could be octopus or squid. Um, and this not entirely sure but it looks like a sea creature guys. And we've got some wasabi. So I guess. So the only thing to do now would be to try it. Yes, try some of the seafood. You know what? I'm going to start with my miso soup. I'll drink the miso and you try the fish. Miso soup approved. So Sam the brave going in for the octopus. Yeah, let's go try some. Normally I would probably dip this into the red sauce but I'll just go for a bite. How brave. Mmmm. What does it taste like? It is really fresh. It doesn't have a strong taste. There has been absolutely no seasonings added. So you would definitely want to add some of the red gochujang sauce (고추장) to make it taste a lot better. Is it chewy? Yeah, it is chewy. Okay. My meal has arrived. Sam actually chose this because I had no clue what to get. But this is called Hoedeopbap (회덮밥) and it is basically rice with vegetables and raw fish on top. Um, the rice actually comes here on the side in this separate little bowl. So what makes deopbap different from say bokkumbap which is the mixed rice is the deopbap you get like your ingredients and then you get your rice so they're not mixed together. They're not. So yeah, lots of veggies here. It looks like we got. Look at all of the sesame seeds. I know so many sesame seeds. Some cabbage, some carrots. Seaweed. That looks delicious. Cucumbers. And apparently I need to add this. Yeah. Correct? You need to put the gochujang sauce (고추장). That looks like it is in a ketchup dispenser. It is not ketchup guys. Do you think that is enough? Yeah, that is good. Give it a try. Try it with a little bit of rice. Try a bit of fish with some vegetables and rice. Let's grab a spoon. This is my first time having this. Ever. Exciting times. Ever. There. Oh. Messy. Make sure you get your fish. It will probably be easier with chopsticks. Haha. Trying to get vegetables as well. Yeah. Rice, fish, vegetables, sauce. Big bite. Mmmm. That is good. How is that? The fish is very mild. Like the white fish it is not very fatty so it doesn't have a strong flavor. It is like having sashimi with rice and veg. It is good. But it needs the sauce for sure. Otherwise it would be a little bit bland. Mmmm. Maybe I should be adding wasabi to this. Just mix it all in. So your food is here now. Yeah my dish has now arrived. Yours came first. So I'm having chobap (초밥) which is the Korean sushi. So take a look down here. I have ten nicely displayed pieces. And as you can see you have of course the sushi kind of Korean chobap (초밥) appearance. It has got the rice and then the fish on top. So I'm just going to grab a piece. Yep. And let's take it for a dunk in the soy sauce. Take it for a swim. No wasabi? Come on! Mmmm. I did put a bit on. Yeah? How is it? It is good. This is a really. It is not. It is a chewy fish. It is not um. It doesn't disintegrate in your mouth. I'm really having to power through it. It is very light. I think we're both having the same fish. Yeah it is very light. It tastes good. And but as you said it is the kind of fish that it needs a strong sauce to go with it. Either the gochujang (고추장) or the soy sauce the kangjang. With the wasabi. Wow, there is some rice flying out of your mouth. There. Whoops. Haha. But yeah if I had to venture a guess I would say this is probably flounder? Hmmm. Would you say? I think so. So Sam is going to try my dish. Yeah, I preformed a little switch-a-roo so I'm going to plop that all in. I don't know if this is how you are supposed to do it but this is how I've decided to do it. I'm putting a bit more of the gochujang sauce (고추장) on. And then let's give that a nice strong mix. I guess I'm just used to like taking one spoonful of rice and then dipping that in to the soup or whatever side I'm having with it. Yeah. That is probably more effective. This is almost like a hoe (회) bibimbap (비빔밥). There we go. I don't know if we're supposed to do it like this. From deopbap to bimbimbap. We've created something new. I've decided to eat it like this so I'm getting a bit of rice, I'm getting a bit of fish and veggies. Let's try that. Mmmmm. What do you think? I actually prefer the cut of fish here. It is a little bit thinner. So it is easier to chew. Yeah. And I think having it with extra ingredients like with the salad and with gochujang (고추장) does give it more of a flavor and taste. So if I had to pick between the two dishes I would go with the Hoedeopbap (회덮밥). I have to agree because I tried to the what shall we call it the sushi. The chobap (초밥). The chobap (초밥) and yeah the cuts are a little bit thicker which makes the fish a little bit chewier once it is in your mouth. So I like mine better too. Yeah. This is good. It is a good order. We also have another fish at the table that we haven't even gotten in to. So if you take a look over here I think this was also part of our banchan (반찬) so it came for free and it is a grilled fish and man using chopsticks this is going to be hard. Let's use a spoon. How do we break this apart? Oh, there we go. Nice. Yeah, I have no idea what kind of fish this is but it has been grilled. The bones are tiny so I think we can probably just eat them. And we can probably have the skin as well to be honest. Maybe I'll pull these bones out. Just in case. Mmmmm. How is that? That is nice. Again. No seasonings so you're just tasting the fish but because it has been grilled it has got like that nice charcoal-y flavor. It is good. Just lots of little bones. Be careful. But I guess you can eat the little bones. Yeah, it is good. Mealtime over. Mealtime over. Look at this plate. No more chobap (초밥). I had it all. And I just had a little bit of rice left. Yeah. We ate all of the fish. We ate all of the fish from the deopbap. So anyways in terms of price point the Hoedeopbap (회덮밥) was thirteen thousand Won (원) and the chobap (초밥) was fifteen thousand Won (원). So in total twenty eight thousand Won (원). That is ₩28,000 KRW. So you're looking at about probably twenty four US dollars. So yeah, really not bad value when you consider that you know we had a seafood feast here. It wasn't just the dishes that we had. We also had a lot of different side dishes that included seafood and fish. So overall it was a big meal and definitely stuffed. And if you can come and visit the Noryangjin Fish Market (노량진시장) it is an experience. You come and you walk around of course and you experience the market and then to come out and have food. It is definitely something we recommend doing in Seoul (서울). So it is snack time in Seoul (서울). What are we doing? Super excited for our snack today. This is a typical Korean snack that you find often on the street. It is called Tteokbokki (떡볶이). But today we are going to have it in a specialty store. Over the years I guess this has become so popular that not only do they sell it on the streets. Now they have dedicated restaurants just for it. So that is exactly what we're going to do. Let's go check this out. Alright, let's eat some teokbokki (떡볶이). Lead the way. So our ddeokbokki (떡볶이) has arrived and it is a fast food masterpiece. Let's have a look here at the plate. So the key ingredient here is the soft rice cakes that you see right here. So aside from that we also have some quail eggs, we have some fish cakes and of course the red spicy Gochujang (고추장) sauce. Yeah, the Gochujang (고추장) sauce is what really makes it. And that is really spicy but also it is quite sweet. It is also quite sweet too. Let's try one. Oh la lah. Oh that is hot. Haha. Yeah, so it is like very chewy rice cakes. Like you had mentioned the sauce is really sweet but also spicy. So you feel it burning in the back of your mouth but it is really sweet in the front. And when we first. Oh wow. Oh and look. Just arrived. This is our twigim (튀김) and gunmandu (군만두) which is our pan-fried dumplings. And basically our assorted battered objects. So aside from the topokki (떡볶이) we also got something else right? Yes, so take a look down here. This is the twigim (튀김) that I was mentioning before. These are the awesome pan-fried mandu. Which are called gun-mandu. And they're some of my favorite things to eat. Before I dig in to those I will show you some of the other things. So we have like, I believe this is the kokuma (고구마) the sweet potato. That has also been deep-fried. This is the DG (xxx) over here. And then there is Hobak (호박) which is the pumpkin. Yeah and also another favorite of mine. There is a few other things. Um, some of it ojingeo (오징어) which is squid and then there is something that looks a little bit like kimbap that has been deep-fried too. So it is almost like tempura for people who aren't familiar with this. Exactly. That is a really good way of putting it. It is similar to tempura. So I will start out with mandu (만두). And we have some soy sauce over here. We do for dipping. But my favorite way of doing it is to make it go for a swim in the dukboki (떡볶이) sauce. So just putting it right in there. Making it spicy. Go for a swim my friend. Okay. So there we go. It is ready to eat. And this is going to be tricky to bite. This is massive but I will try. One big bite. Mmmmm. Woah. That is so good. I really like the gunmandu (군만두). The pan-fried mandu on its own but when you put the Tteokbokki (떡볶이) sauce it is like man you're taking it from like a eight or nine to a ten. It is so delicious. So so delicious. Okay, so I am going for pumpkin. Your turn to try the twigim (튀김). I am going to dip it in the soy sauce because the other one is burning my mouth at the moment. It is pretty strong. So there we go. Pumpkin battered with soy sauce. Mmmmm. How is that? That is good. You know I like the combination, sweet and spicy, but a bit of salty with the soy sauce you can kind of alternate between the two. It is good. Mmmmm. Going in for more. Going for another before they disappear. That is how you know it is good. Before Sam gets to them. Start having your second bite before I even stop filming. That is when I know you like it. Hahaha. Alright, so my time to try the pure Tteokbokki (떡볶이). So I've got my fish cake and I'm going to skewer that with a rice cake. How about an egg Sam? How come you're not grabbing an egg? Not a big fan of egg so those will be yours. Wow. Delicious. Guys if you're trying Korean rice cakes for the first time be sure to chew them really well because they can get stuck. They can get stuck in your throat. Oh, you know what I also like? What? They give you this light broth to go along with the Tteokbokki (떡볶이). And this just comes for free. Let's try that. And I like it because it is very light and mild. So if you need a break from the spice just have a sip of that. I think it is to calm down your stomach. Yeah. Hahaha. To slow the burn. So that was almost a really embarrassing price point because we barely had enough money. Yeah, we kind of forgot how low we were on cash reserves. And like we were scrounging together our last coins to pay for that. But we had enough to pay. We literally just had enough. Okay, so price point. How much was that? So that was twelve thousand five hundred Won. So ₩12,500. And that is basically about roughly 10 US dollars. A little bit more than ten US dollars. So awesome value, I mean that was a lot of food. We ordered a double portion of the Tteokbokki (떡볶이) plus the gunmandu (군만두) plus the twigim (튀김) so a lot of food. Really delicious. We're both full. Our bellies are a little bit, you know they're feeling the burn, and most importantly lesson learned guys. Before you go into a restaurant check your wallet. Yeah, seriously. We should know this by now but you'd be surprised how often this happens. Too often. Way too often. Okay let's go home. Okay so what is on the menu for today Sam? Alright, so for lunch today we're having Tonkatsu (돈까스) and Udon (우동) and this place is right nearby our apartment where we're staying at in Hapjeong here in Seoul and I just happened to discover it. As was at the sauna the other day and I was walking around, and I'm like ah I'm really hungry, afterwards it was like I don't know like probably really late at night. Ten or eleven. So I saw this place outside that had a huge Donkatsu (돈가스) sign and I'm like I've gotta come here and try it. Yeah, and he came without me. Yeah, and let me tell you they have the biggest portions of Donkkaseu (돈까스) so when it comes here we're going to be in for a treat. Alright, so we need to show you guys what showed up at the table like two seconds ago. Yeah. This is insane. I wasn't kidding when I said the portions were huge. Like massive. Here is my hand for a sense of scale. This is bigger than like both of my hands. It is bigger than your head. It is bigger. Way bigger. It is bigger than your stomach. It is way bigger than my face. So basically this is a Japanese dish that has become popular in Korea. It was invented in the 19th Century. It is basically a breaded piece of pork cutlet. Yeah, and it deep-fried. So if you look down here you can see that it has a gravy sauce over it. Oh la lah. But you can also get it in Korea as well with a curry. Yeah, with a curry sauce. Sometimes you get it without sauce so it just has cheese stuffed inside. That is also really good too. Yeah. And there is just a whole bunch of different variations and it has become such a staple in Korea that you can find it almost anywhere. You can find it at kimbap restaurants, you can find it at a restaurant like here that specializes in it. Yeah. And you can also find it in Japanese Korean restaurants so. And you know what else? We've had similar dishes to this around the world wouldn't you say? Yeah, we sure have. Schnitzel comes to mind. It reminds me of schnitzel in Austria and Germany. Yeah. And it also reminds me of Milanesa in Argentina. So this is the kind of classic pork cutlet meal and I'm just going to take my first bite here. Yeah, you're just soaking it in the gravy. Soaking it in the gravy. I love this stuff. I know. It looks so good. It is so good. I actually want some. I have food envy at the moment. Hahaha. Alright, so my has arrived as well. And when I saw the size of the bowl it was like oh my gosh. This could feed a family or like a couple. Check it out. This is like a massive bowl. I knew you were going to like this one. I don't know how I'm going to finish all of this. But basically I'm having Udong (우동) which is a thick type of wheat flower noodle. We've got some greens here. No idea what kind of greens. It looks like maybe some fish cakes, some tempura. Um, yeah and we asked for it spicy. So we'll see what that is like. Actually he told me it is going to be very spicy. Very spicy. Oh ho ho. Well, well. This is going to be kind of messy. Mmmm. What do you think? Ah, my tongue was immediately on fire. So he was not kidding about the spice. Wow. Haha. Let's try with some greens. I wonder what this is? Oh man, I feel like I should have tied up my hair today. This is like a messy meal. You really have to get involved here. Mmmm. Spicy? Mmmm. Alright being the nice guy that I am I was kind enough to share. I mean I did have like a Fred Flintstone sized portion so. Look at how much he is willing to share. These two little nuggets basically. Still I was planning on eating the whole thing. So I want you to try it. I'm going to steal some of your gravy first of all. There we go. Actually I've already tried this when you weren't looking I took a piece. So this is your second bite. I didn't even see you having your first one. How is that? It is good. I just love this sweet gravy. It works really well with the pork. Really nice. So how are you enjoying that meal so far? Loving it and what came to mind is this reminds me so much of the different kind of bodegóns we used to go to in Buenos Aires. And what the bodegóns were liked these traditional restaurants that had kind of a simple decor inside. Everything was all about the food and this is what this place is about. Like it is very simple inside, it is not fancy, the prices are very reasonable but as you can see by the portions that we have like we are being fed very well. They do not skimp out here. This is almost like a double meal here. Yeah, it is kind of going to be a challenge to finish all of this. Well, I'm going to finish my donkaseu (돈가스). You've got your work cut out with your Udon (우동). Well Sam, you did very well. Yep. Look at that. That deserves an A+ for effort. I on the other hand. You know what you almost finished. You almost finished. Like half. No, you did way more than half. Come on. You know my tongue is on fire. That is the reason I have to stop. It is like burning. Yeah. But anyways let's talk about price point. So on to price point. So my Tonkatsu (돈까스) was eight thousand Won and you Udong (우동) was six thousand Won so it came to fourteen thousand Won in total which is W14,000 KRW. And that is roughly like under twelve US dollars. About eleven something US dollars so it is a lot of food for not a lot of money. And now that I've found this place just a few days ago we're definitely going to be coming back here quite regularly I think. Yes but next up I need a Popsicle to cool down. Hahaha. So for today's video we are planning to a visit a traditional Korean tea house (전통 찻집). And it is super hot and humid outside but it is one of those things you just have to do in Seoul (서울). So we're just dealing with the heat and we're going to drink some hot tea and have some rice cakes. Let's sweat it out. Let's go. So our teas have arrived. Tell us what we're having. Yeah, so the one that I ordered is called gyepi cha (계피 차) and you can have a look at it down here. It comes in a nice like kind of fancy traditional cup. It is almost like a soup bowl. Yeah, it really is. And this is a Korean cinnamon tea (한국어 계피 차) so I'm really excited about this. I love anything with cinnamon so this should be great. And we also ordered some sweets to go along with the tea. So what can you tell us? What are we having there. Yeah, so this is really exciting. We've got persimmon slices. They've been dried and then we have some special tteok (떡) which is the Korean rice cakes and they appear to have it looks like rice crispies around them. Yeah they're actually instead of cakes they're more like rice crisps. And I think we've had these ones before like several years ago and they're really airy. They're almost like rice puffs but they are sweet. So I'm trying the tea (차). And I think you were the clever one today. You got yours as iced. Mine is piping hot and it must be like I don't know 35 degrees with high humidity. Yeah, it is really hot out. So I'm a little bit crazy but at least it is air conditioned in here. Oh, wow. Wow. That is like intense cinnamon flavor. Yeah, it kind of smells like Christmas over here. It does. And it is wonderful. Like it is natural cinnamon. It is not that artificial like garbage-y type. Hahaha. Which are unfortunately in a lot of products. This is real authentic cinnamon. And it has got a bit of a kick to it. Okay, so for mine I got the Maesilcha (매실차, 梅實茶) which is a green plum tea and it has got ice cubes in it. Much needed today. Hahaha. You can actually see behind you there is the air conditioner guys. That huge air conditioner. That is so so hot. And this is so good it is like juice. It is like a sweet syrupy plum juice. Refreshing? Um hum. So good. I think you're going to need to share that one with me. So time to try the snacks now. Yeah. So I'm going to start off with having one of the sliced dried persimmons (감). And it appears that there is some like chunks of nuts. I'm not sure what that is. If I had to guess without even tasting it I would say maybe walnut. Mmmm. How is that? It is good. It is sweet but not too overpowering. I mean you really taste the persimmon. It is kind of like a little bit like a jam. And I think I was right I'm pretty sure this is walnuts. Hodu (호두). So really tasty. It goes well with the tea. And we have a second snack. So do you want to try one of those? Sure. Oh wow. Mmmm. Yeah these are one of the puffed rice cakes. Let's have a closer look. Really good. Again. They look fluffy inside. Again not too strongly flavored or sugary. Which is really nice because the teas are quite sweet so this is a nice light snack to go along with it. So I would say that was a very relaxing experience. It was almost like whisper quiet in there with classical music softly playing. The cool thing is like when you arrive to these establishments really early you can sometimes be the first person there. Yeah and we were the only ones there. Yeah and it there are some people now but while we were having our tea we were the only people there. Yeah. So pretty awesome. Cool. Okay so let's talk about the price for that. So the price point was nineteen thousand five hundred Won which is ₩18,500. And that is roughly about 17 US dollars right now. So again it was a little pricey but I mean again we're in the Insadong (인사동) area and it is very touristy. And you're paying for that kind of like authentic tea house traditional tea house (전통 찻집) experience. My oh my! This morning we came to building 63 with the intention of going up to the top for city views and it was insane. Yeah. Okay, first off guys thirty five degrees outside and we had to walk a kilometer from the station to Building 63. So we're like dripping sweat. You can imagine two waegooks just pouring sweat. And then we go here and there is about a thirty to one hour wait time. Just to get the elevator. So we needed to cool down so we're going with something authentic Korean. We're getting Bibim Naengmyeon (비빔 냉면) which is going to be mine and Mul Naengmyeon (물 냉면) for yours. So basically these are buckwheat noodles, they're served cold. Yours comes in a cold broth with vegetables and egg and bunch of other ingredients. And the difference between yours and mine is that mine doesn't come with a cold broth. Mine comes with Gochujang (고추장) sauce and basically the rest is very similar. So our food is finally here. I am starving because I skipped breakfast today. So let's have a look at this perfect summer dish. I'm having Mul Naengmyeon (물 냉면) and this is basically a bowl of buckwheat noodles. They are handmade and they're in a bowl of chilled icy broth. So I don't know if you can see it on the camera but it is like slushy. My broth actually has chunks of ice in it. Super refreshing. Huh? Yeah. And this is like the quintessential Korean summer dish. Yeah. Exactly. And you'll also notice that the vegetables are raw. So I have some cucumbers here, some radish and of course it is topped off with a hard boiled egg and some sesame seeds. Yeah and as a side dish you got some Bulgogi (불고기). I got Pulgogi (불고기) which is the marinated sweet beef. I'm going to start with this actually. And mushrooms too. How is that? This is good. But let's move on to the main dish. So normally in restaurants they actually give you scissors to cut into the noodles but they haven't done that here. So it is going to be a little messy to eat. hahaha. So excuse that. You're going to have to break it off with your teeth. Mmmhmmm. Go for it. Exactly. Mmmmmm. Oh my gosh. Super chewy, huh? There you go. There you go. You cannot break them off with your teeth. Super super chewy noodles. How do they taste? Good. I need to chew. Give me a second. So that was good. It kind of tastes like cold spaghetti. Which sounds a bit nasty plain cold spaghetti. But because it is made out of buckwheat it has a very distinct flavor so it is really nice. And it is also taken on the flavor from the broth so it is a little bit tangy and savory. So I quite like it. I'm enjoying it. I was super hot before sitting down at the table so this is going to be a really refreshing meal. So yeah, good stuff. And you know what later on you can drink the soup with a spoon. There you go. So Sam's meal is kind of similar to mine but slightly different. Slightly different. Mine is called Bibim Naengmyeon (비빔 냉면) and the biggest difference between this and the Mul Naengmyeon (물 냉면) is of course that I have Gochujang (고추장) the red pepper paste instead of the broth. So that is really the main difference. The buckwheat noodles are the same, the vegetables are the same although I think I may have slightly different veggies. You have more vegetables than yours. And you know what. You have Kimchi (김치). I have an egg. I have Kimchi (김치) and an egg on top. So my goal here is basically to mix it all around a bit. So I'm going to mix that around. Try to disperse that sauce a little. You know what? I'm kind of jealous of yours. Hahaha. I really like that sauce. I think I got the best one. Oh, and the coolest thing is they did give me some of the cool broth on the side. Basically, I think as a way to cool down this summer because otherwise I'm guessing this is probably not served with it normally. Hahahaha. Alright, let's try that. So I'm just going to go in for some noodles here. This is going to be messy. It is so chewy. Wait and see. Oh you took a baby bite. That is cheating. I cheated. Mmmm. Wow. So yeah, the noodles are really good. But the overwhelming taste here is of the Gochujang (고추장) sauce. Man it hits you hard. It is very spicy but man I love Gochujang (고추장) so this is like. This is like I definitely ordered the right one. Hahahaha. I'm not going to share. So we finally found the scissors halfway through the meal. We finally smartened up a little bit here. Yeah. So this is how you do it. Just put it in and slice it up. The noodles are so long and chewy that we were struggling. Like it is so easy to choke on them. So yeah, you just take the scissors, snip snip. And now mine. I'll get my chopsticks out of here. Now this is probably not the official way to do it here in Korea. I'm sure there is a really good technique that normal Koreans would use but this is Waegook style. Alright. There we go. I think we can go back to eating. Hahaha. Are your lips burning Sam? You're looking a little red over there. Tongue is on fire. That Gochujang (고추장) was like really potent. Man, wow. It was spicy. Super spicy. Okay, so we finished our meal. We're going to be heading up to the viewing deck on Building 63 soon. Yeah. But let's talk about the price first. So it was eight thousand each. So it came to sixteen thousand Won. W16,000. And that is roughly like about fourteen US dollars. So really good value. I mean this is kind of a fancy building in here. But I will say that I have seen the Naengmyun (냉면) and the Mul Naengmyeon (물 냉면) for about six thousand Won elsewhere. But this still was a really good price and the quality was excellent. So yeah, if you happen to visit Korea during the summer months these are two dishes you absolutely must try. Absolutely. So for today's lunch we are going to be having Samgyeopsal (삼겹살) and that is a Korean pork belly that you cook yourself at the table. It is like really fatty pork, so it is going to be nice and crisp. Yeah, it kind of reminds me a little bit of Canadian bacon except more thickly sliced. Bacon for lunch. Um, but yeah I should also mention if it sounds a little bit windy in here it is because we've got the AC blasting and there is fans on in every single direction. The fans are going and the TV is on. So yeah, that is a sign that it is a really hot day here in Korea. And guys this is basically your classic Korean barbecue (고기구이). Ummm, it should be fun. Our side dishes have also arrived. Do you want to give us a tour of the table? Sure, so let's take a look over here. So we've got some different pickled basically vegetables over here. And this over here is the garlic. This is one of my favorite things. Oh yeah. One of my favorite things to add to the Korean barbecue. And I believe this is called manul (마늘) and then we have something called ssamjang (쌈장) which is a mixture of the red pepper paste, the gochujang (고추장) and the doenjang (된장) sauce. So it is kind of like a mixture of the two. Awesome sauce. Over here we've got the kimchi (김치) of course. It looks like we've got some kind of pink radish. And yeah. Salad. We are good to go. And this over here it looks like crab. Yeah, and I didn't mention this over here is kind of like a dipping sauce for the samgyeopsal (삼겹살). So we're just cooking it now. It is sizzling. And it is going to be ready to eat soon. So they came and helped us out a little bit. And they basically cut the meat into little pieces so that they can cook a little bit further and get nice and golden. Also, I should mention this meat isn't seasoned at all and they didn't add any oil to cook it either. I think the idea is just that the fat is going to start melting and that will allow it to cook. You know cook in its own fat and give it more flavor. So yeah, we're just waiting now. Waiting for it to turn golden and crispy. I like mine really burnt. Yeah, me too. Which is kind of strange because like if I'm eating steak or something else like that I tend to like it a bit more rare. Yeah, a bit more raw. But with Samgyeopsal (삼겹살) I find it tastes optimum when it is like charred a bit. Yeah, it is so fatty that you kind of want it to be golden and crispy. Otherwise it is just like chewing fat and I'm not a huge fan of that. So it is time to start cooking some garlic now that the meat is almost ready. Yeah, we're at that stage now and I find that it is best just to put it kind of on the periphery of the grill so it doesn't get in the way of the meat. So we're just going to start plopping that down. And with the garlic you have to pay a lot of attention because it can burn quite fast. So you're going to really want to pay attention to that. Mmmmmm. So maybe put half of it on now and then we can put half of it on later. Okay, so time to make this happen. Let's assemble your first bite. It sure is time. I can't wait for this. So I'm grabbing my piece of Samgyeopsal (삼겹살), the Korean pork belly and you know what I am going for a super one here so I'm putting my garlic, my manul on here, a little bit of ssamjang put that right like that and a little bit some salad. Wow that is going to be a big bite. Perfect. It is going to be a huge bite. And now I'm going to roll that all up. Gamsahamnida (감사합니다). Oh we get jjigae (too. kimchi jjigae (김치 찌개)? Ne. Gamsahamnida (감사합니다). So now the expert roller is going to turn this into a bite sized ball. It is all ready just scrunch it up into a ball. And one shot. One bomb. Mmmmm. Oh man. That is so good. It has been ages since I've had Korean bbq and I have to say this place is really nailing it. This is the real authentic deal. We're here in Seoul, Korea now and we're having like just an amazing Samgyeopsal (삼겹살) experience. Loving it. So it is now time for my first bite. So let's do this right. I'm going to grab my lettuce (상추쌈) leaf, grab my chopsticks and I want this piece right here. This is just looks nice and crispy. Golden to perfection. I'm also going to add some rice to mine. They just brought us some rice. So maybe like just a bite size. Yeah, put that in there. Yeah. Little bit of this sauce for flavor. Ssamjang (쌈장). Some garlic (마늘). I'm going to be getting lots of kisses tonight, right Sam? Hahahaha. Yeah, the nice thing though is that we're going to have equally bad breath. We'll both have garlic breath. Yeah. Some of this pickled stuff. Okay and that is probably a big enough bite for me. You're going all out. That is a huge bite. That is bigger than mine. I think this maybe two bites. Or maybe one. Yeah, go for two. I don't want you choking on it here. Woah! You did it all. Mmmmm. How is that? Mmmmmm. A lot of competing flavors. Mmmmmhmmmm. Taste the garlic. You can taste the samgyeopsal (삼겹살), the ssamjang sauce. That is going to take you a while to chew. Hahahaha. So just as you are chewing that I'll point out that we typically, the reason why it is not busy here right now, is that we typically are coming and filming really early like eleven thirty before people tend to come in around twelve thirty or one. And we're doing that so that we kind of have the place to ourselves. So that was really good. I really enjoy that first bite. I think my favorite thing is the whole garlic clove in there. Like it is not the same as raw garlic, of course, it is nice and golden and it just gives a nice flavor overall. I also really enjoy this spicy sauce. The ssamjang. It is just so nice when it all mixes together. And we have a lot left to eat guys. So it is chow time. Yeah and you know what the meat was not fatty. I was expecting it to be a little chewy and greasy but we've been letting it cook for an extra long time so I think that is the trick. If you don't like fatty meat. I think we got a nice cut too. Yeah, this is good stuff. Going in for number two. And you know what if you're not a big fan of spicy sauces, yeah, they also give you a pretty simple sauce that you can dip your meat in. You can just pickup your slice of Samgyeopsal (삼겹살), your Korean pork belly, and just kind of like coat it in this which is kind of like oil and kind of a salt mixture. Well, I don't know about coating it. I would have just dipped it a little bit for some salt. Mmmmm. That is nice. How is that? Yeah. It enhances the flavor for sure. Yep. Mmmhmmm. Very good. And in true Korean fashion I think we have some kind of game show happening in the background on the TV. Oh wait, no it is a sporting event. You know what before there was like a Korean drama where everybody was wearing Hanbok (한복). So pretty cool programming on today. So aside from all of the meat they also brought us jjigae which is kind of like a soup or a stew. Yeah, that was really nice of them. I think this was complimentary service. Yeah, so this one has the gimchi. The cabbage. It has a little bit of pork as well. It also has the tofu. The dubu (두부). A little bit of everything. There is the dubu. So I eat this by grabbing some rice first. Got some rice here. And then I dip it in the soup. Taking it for a swim. That is my style. I don't know if that is how you're supposed to do it or not but that is how I roll. Audrey's special way of eating Korean soup. Korean stew. Mmmmm. Is that tasty? The meat is super tender. Super super tender. Spicy? Not too spicy. It is actually mild in comparison to what we've been having. Also I like to point out we're having purple rice right now. Normally they just give you plain white rice so this feels a little bit fancy in a way. So yeah, lovely meal over here. I'm really enjoying this. So we've been at it for a while with this meal. What is our progress update? So we've finished round one. We had a tiny bit of Samgyeopsal (삼겹살) left so if you look down here I'll explain what is going on. So as you can see here this is the last of the Samgyeopsal (삼겹살). We have about six pieces. But what we have done is we've put the Kimchi on here. Yeah. And the rest of the garlic. Lots of garlic going on there. We've got some tasty bits left to try. So I think the kimchi has been cooked enough. Ready to try it. Oh that is hot. I bet it is. It is fresh off of the grill. Wow. You know that is very different from having it like raw. Yeah. Because it still kind of gets rid a little bit of the spice and it cooks it a bit. So it just has more of like a little bit less crispy but I don't know it somehow I feel like it enhances the flavor of it a little bit. I really do like it grilled as well. You know what it is kind of hard to concentrate on what you're saying because just behind you we have some very intense scenes as part of a modern Korean drama. Hahaha. I think one of the main characters might be having a flashback to an accident. Wow. That deeply affected his life. And I can't even watch it. You're the only one who gets a view. You're missing out here. Alright, well we cleaned that up. The grill is empty. Nothing left on the grill. Guys that was a glorious Korean barbecue. Like the best Korean barbecue. Seriously. Awesome stuff. So let's talk about the price point for that. Okay, so the price point was that was 10,000 per person. So ten thousand Korean Won. So it came to twenty thousand Korean Won in total which is 20,000. And that is roughly about 17 to 18 US dollars right now. So excellent value. Yeah and we still have food left over. Especially the side dishes. We still have some banchan (반찬) to take care of but we've taken care of the principle bbq which was the main mission here. Well good morning from Namdaemun Market (남대문시장). Today we have chosen to skip lunch and have lots of snacks at this market instead so I'm pretty excited for that. Yeah, so Namdaemun Sijang (남대문시장) Namdaemun Market is the oldest market in Seoul (서울) and it is also one of the best places to get Korean street food (한국 길거리 음식). So we're just going to go on a rampage and eat as much Korean street food as we possibly can. A rampage! You heard it here first. Let's go eat. So I got myself a potato corn dog. So this is a hot dog (핫도그) on a stick. It has been breaded I guess and then they've attached these french fries as well. So it is like really over the top and I'm going to add some ketchup. Wow, look at that. And what else can I put on. Spicy sauce. This is a very uniquely Korean hot dog (핫도그) so put some spicy sauce on that too. Come out. Just come out spice. Oh, that is thick. Woah! Woah. Man, that looks good. Alright. Look at all of the french fries. You can see the french fries. I know. So well on there. This is my first time trying this so we'll see. Aw. It is hot. Oh. It is super hot. Huh. There you have it. Mmmmm. Oh, wow. This is like fast food to the max. So what do you think? It is pretty good actually. Is there a lot of batter on the outside? Yeah, you can see it there. Alright, time for Sam to share his thoughts. Yeah, so my turn to try as well. This is my first time to actually have this. I've had like a lot of Korean street food (한국 길거리 음식). And I've like walked by this many times but I've never actually had it. Yeah. So exciting times here. I'm just going to go in for a big bite. Big bite he says. Mmmm. Oh, and you've got some sauce stuck to your lips. Oh my gosh. Yeah. That. You can really see the hot dog (핫도그) in there. So you do taste the hot dog. Then you really taste the batter but you also taste the crispiness of the french fries too. So it is really tasty. I'm really enjoying it. It is delicious. Yeah. It is kind of like having your hot dog on a bun with a side of fries except it has all been rolled into one. It has all been put into one thing right here. So what was the price for this one? So this one was three thousand Won (원). ₩3000 KRW. So a little bit less than three US dollars. Odeng (오뎅) hana juseyo. So we're trying Odeng (오뎅) which is a Korean fishcake. And this is one of the most common Korean street foods (한국 길거리 음식) you can find in just about everywhere. Often places where you get tteokbokki (떡볶이). Yeah, and it is so cheap. This is usually fifty cents. Yeah, this one was more expensive because it is in Namdaemun (남대문). Yeah. It was one thousand Won (원). ₩1000 KRW. But let's try that. Put a little bit of soy sauce on it. Yeah. And at first glance it looks a lot like a pancake that has been folded and then put on a little stick. Nothing like a pancake. A fishy pancake. It tastes fishy. Actually it doesn't have that strong of a taste. Um, I would kind of describe it has like a bit of a spongy exterior. Mmm. Spongy texture. Yeah. So it is really good. Um, I'm enjoying it big time. So after coming to this market so many times while I lived here I just discovered something new. This market has two levels so we're going into the basement area right now to see what we can find in terms of food. Mayak gimbap (마약김밥) juseyo. Hana. (Speaking Korean) Gamsahamnida. Okay so we're here in the basement level of the Namdaemun Market (남대문시장). We found a little treasure of a restaurant here. Just a tiny little hole-in-the-wall place. Yeah. And we are having mayak kimbap (마약김밥). And if you've never had gimbap (김밥) before these are basically your Korean rice rolls. That is kind of like a Korean form of like a maki or sushi. And what makes these different from the ones that you typically get at Gimbap restaurants is these are actually baby gimbap (마약김밥). Yeah, they are miniature in size. Right. So a normal gimbap (김밥) roll would be really thick and bigger and go longer and then it would be sliced up like this. Yeah. But these mayak gimbap (마약김밥) have not been sliced. They've just been made into little rolls. Yeah. And so let's try it. Looks good. So it is a little seaweed roll. It has sesame seeds. And let's have a look at the filing. It looks like radish. Yeah, we've got radish and carrots. We've got radish and carrot. I think it is a pure vegetarian one. Vegetarian friendly. And they gave us a sauce. Right, let me try that. Let's try the sauce. Oh yeah, that is like a almost like a wasabi sauce. Woo! So it is spicy. I heard her say it is not spicy. Man, good thing you're trying it. And another cool thing she gave us soup. This is a soup. Little cups. This is a soup that you often get with when you get Odeng (오뎅). Other kind of fish cakes. It is a light soup. Yeah, so like soy base with chives. Alright, Audrey your turn. My turn. I'll take one of these. Maybe one from the top actually. Oh, I wouldn't mix it too much. No, haha. You're going to be in for a surprise. It is still warm. The rice is still warm. Yeah, it just has been freshly made. That is a lot of wasabi. Yeah. Wow. Oh my gosh. It is like a wasabi mustard. Oh, you're feeling it. Hahaha. I knew you were going to be in pain after dunking it in that deep. That is hilarious. Hahaha. You didn't tell me it was that bad. Jeez. That is mean. Alright, have another bite without so much on it. So what do you think of the mayak gimbap (마약김밥)? I like it. It is a perfect little snack. Oh, I just sprayed some sesame seeds there. It is a perfect little snack. You know, then you have it packaged in these little containers to take it to go. Eat it at a park. Take it home. And take it easy on the sauce guys. One little dunk is enough. Don't uh go in to heavy like we did. So we just found the jackpot here. Yeah, we've found a place that sells all kinds of like western and American products here. We've got peanut butter, we've got like Swiss hot chocolate over there. Oh, Nutella. We've got Nutella. We've got special kinds of coffee. Oh, I thought that was Vegemite for some reason. We've got Quaker Oats in the background. So are you coveting anything? Haha. We're leaving here soon so I don't think we can buy anything but I would get the massive jar of peanut butter. That would be on my wishlist. So we may have come to Namdaemun (남대문) for the street food; however, this is also a great place if you're looking to get a bargain on basically anything. You can buy shoes here, clothes, winter jackets. Toys for children. School supplies. Basically anything you can imagine you'll find it here. Plus food. Anyeonghaseyo. One jjinppang hana juseyo. Hangye juseyo. Ne. Gamsahamnida. So somebody found another snack. What did you get? Yeah, we just found this place that specializes in Mandu (만두) and different other kinds of steamed buns. And we're getting something called Wang Jjinppang (왕찐빵) and Wang refers to the giant size of this. Look at how big this is. I'm putting this in my hand. It is piping hot. Yeah. So I'm going to put it back in. Try not to burn yourself. It is bigger than my hand so that is why you get the name wang. Jjinppang (찐빵) I believe it going to have red bean paste inside so let's take a bite. Oh yeah. Look at all of that. Oh man. Woah. That is so good. It has been mashed up and it is very sweet but you really taste the bean as well. Yeah, so and it kind of looks like it has a fluffy bread texture. It is very fluffy bread. It is piping hot and you can probably see the steam coming off of it. So I'm going in for another bite. Mmmm. That is so good. And this was one was really reasonably priced. It was one thousand five hundred Won (원). So ₩1500 KRW. So a little bit less than one fifty US dollars so great value. Man, I'm loving this. So something cool about Namdaemun Market (남대문시장) here in Seoul (서울) is that you can go down these little side alleys and you have like these kind of tiny little hole in the wall restaurants. So we're going to show you a bit of what that looks like. So it looks like we've stumbled upon some kind of musical slash cultural performance in the middle of the market. So we're going to check it out before that ends. (Korean traditional music and singing and chanting) Anyeonghaseyo. Goguma hana juseyo. Almaeyo? Cheon Won (원). Gamsahamnida. What did you get? I got myself Goguma (고구마) which is Korean sweet potato. Man, is it ever hot. It has been freshly steamed. It was just steaming right in front of us so you can tell that it is hot. So I'm just going to go in for a bite. You can see. Look at that. Peel back the skin a bit. You know what? You can actually eat the skin. I've seen. I've when I lived here before I did eat the skin. So I'm going to try a little bit. First without the skin. It almost looks like pumpkin in terms of color. Oh. and texture. Oh. It is very sweet. Very rich. It tastes really really good. Would you have this for dessert? This is like a natural fruit dessert. Basically. I mean it is not even a fruit. It is a sweet potato (고구마). So I'm going to try a bit of the skin this time. Mmmm. My advice is honestly to eat the skin. It is really good. And how much was this? This was only cheon Won (원). One thousand Won (원). So again, less than one US dollar. Dulgae juseyo. Wow. Hanguk Saram? Hahaha. Canada Saram. Ah, Canada Saram. Ne. Hangul mal chareyo? Anio chal motayo. Gamsahamnida. Hahaha. So for our final snack of the day we are having Hotteok (호떡). And I feel like we've shown this snack probably a million times on our channel but we just like it. It is our favorite Korean food. That much street food though. Whenever we see it we're like gotta get Hotteok (호떡). And it is the best way to end off a Korean street food taste test because you're getting something really sweet. Really tasty. Yeah so, again in case you haven't memorized this by now. Hotteok (호떡) is like this fat fluffy pancake and inside it is filled with brown sugar, cinammon and pine nuts and it is just amazing. Amazing. It is cooked and made hot so while you're biting into it you get like these gooey bites and it is usually not until you get until about the middle of it that you start really getting a lot of the sauce. Try to see it there. It is oozing that sugar. Look at that. It is so hot. So warm. And it was only one thousand Won (원). Oh wow. Less than a dollar. Wow, that is a great price especially for Namdaemun (남대문). Like it is typically it is one thousand Won (원) elsewhere but Namdaemun (남대문) can be more expensive for sure. It is so hot. Ah. Piping hot huh? So what is the verdict? Good quality one? It is always great. Mmmm. Time for me to try mine. Oh. You're right. There is no such thing as a bad Hotteok (호떡). Yeah. This is like my favorite thing we've eaten at the market today. It always is. Always is. Hotteok (호떡) always wins. Number one. For the win right at the end. Leaving satisfied? Leaving very satisfied. That was, I mean actually I know I was going to eat a lot but I actually ended up eating a whole lot more than I originally planned. Like that was a pig out for the ages. But in a good way. So if you're coming to Namdaemun Market (남대문시장) I think something that you should understand is that it is a little bit more touristy than some of the other Korean more local Korean markets. And you can expect to pay a little bit more for some of the Korean street food. A prime example of that was when we had Odeng (오뎅). Normally I pick that up elsewhere for maybe five hundred Won (원). ₩500 KRW. Whereas here I paid a thousand. So I paid double. But there were some treats that I had that were exactly the same price including the Hotteok (호떡) which was a thousand here. Also a thousand in most other places. So pretty good. So anyways I hope you enjoyed this Korean street food (한국 길거리 음식) video and be sure to stay tuned on our channel every Monday. We have new videos coming out from South Korea. And if you're new to our channel check out our 50 things to do in Seoul guide. So we'll see you soon with new Korean content. Lunchtime in Seoul (서울)! We are having lunch today at like four in the afternoon because we've been out sightseeing. So we are starving. So so hungry. And today we're going to be having Samgyetang (삼계탕). Did I pronounce that right? Samgyetang (蔘鷄湯). Yep. There you go. And this is a Ginseng Chicken soup and Sam has ordered a variation of the dish so he's having Ginseng Chicken Porridge (삼계탕죽). So we're going to show you what those two dishes look like. So because this restaurant specializes in Korean Ginseng chicken. There is actually five different ones you can choose from so let's take a look at the menu. And you have the one we ordered is supposed to be good for you health. Now there is another one that is good for beauty. For beauty. How come you didn't order that one Sam? I've been looking a little scruffy these days. You know what? I think I could use a beauty enhancement more than anyone else. A beauty enhancing soup. Oh my gosh. And then there is of course the Juk (죽) one. The Korean porridge version of that. And I've never had Samgyetang porridge (삼계탕죽) so that is going to be really interesting. I can't wait to try that one. Ooh. Gamsahamnida. Look at that. Still bubbling. Gamsahamnida. So the coolest thing just happened with our meal. Like we were planning on ordering the Ginseng Wine which is called Insamju (인삼주) and she just brought it over as service. For free. It is like read my mind. That is awesome. So we have some Ginseng wine to compliment the Ginseng soup and Ginseng porridge. Let's have a taste. So let's try that Insamju (인삼주). It doesn't have a strong smell. Does it taste like medicine? Or is it pleasant? Oh wow. Let me have another sip. It really tastes like nothing. Nothing else I've ever had before. I'm trying to think of a comparable. It is a little bit fruity, little bit sweet. It doesn't have a strong alcohol taste and it also doesn't have that strong of a ginseng taste to be honest. It tastes hints of it but it is kind of fascinating. He's fascinated. Interesting. So my Samgyetang (삼계탕) has arrived. Check it out. So since it is for one person you obviously don't get the whole chicken but if you were ordering a family sized one the chicken would actually be stuffed with rice and garlic so I have a smaller portion. I still there is some inside. Yeah. Maybe not much though. Sometimes it comes with jujubes as well. Yeah. So yeah, it is like a very light broth. It looks like chicken soup when you have a cold. Yeah. I know that it is considered one of the healthier dishes that you can have in Korea. Oh. It has a lot of health benefits associated with it. And look at this there is like a teabag but I think it is probably filled with spices. Yeah. Look. That is pretty cool. That is going to make the broth super flavorful. And it is a thicker broth. Is it? Yeah. Mmmmm. That is nice. How do you like that? It has a lot of spices. I mean lots of new spices for me. A quick question is this your first time to try this? I had it once before many years ago. So and it has been a long time for me too. Yeah. But this isn't bad. What do you think? It is nice. I like it. I think I got some of the chicken breast here. So I'm just going to break it apart. The chicken still has the skin on it and bones. Plop that on the plate. Oh, lots of bones. Oh my. Be careful. I know this is going to be tricky with chopsticks. How am I going to manage? Hahaha. The true test. Has Audrey mastered the use of chopsticks. Let's see. Duh duh duh. Let's pick out the bone. This is the wishbone. Oh my gosh. So do you want to make a wish? Let's break that. First you try some of the chicken and then we'll do that. Let's save that for later. Let's put it here. Save it here. Oh my, so much going on. There is so much excitement here. Okay. Yeah. It is a good meal. I like it. Chicken nice and tender? Mmmmm. Super tender and you know what the food came out so fast. I think they probably are just working on it before anyone shows up you know. Because it was here right away. Yeah, we're not eating at a typical dinner time so maybe they were getting it ready for the dinner crowd. For the dinner crowd yeah. Maybe it was leftover from lunch. We're kind of in between the lunch and dinnertime. So Sam here ready to dig in? Yeah, let's check out what the Juk (죽) form looks like. Okay so you can see that it is a lot thicker than mine. Yeah, it is very thick. So I'm going to give that a good stir. Yeah. And you can tell that the chicken has already been de-boned. I can of like that. It is less work for you. Yeah, less work. So let's try that. It looks really hot. Piping hot. I'm going to blow on it. Don't burn yourself. I also noticed yours had um black sesame seeds on top. Mmmmm. How is that? Oh, wow. That is delicious. Yeah? Yeah. It has got like it is such a thick juk (죽) like broth. The porridge-y broth and then I really taste a lot of the tastes like the shredded chicken and then I think I had something like pine nut in there. Oh, so that was really tasty. Nice. Look at that. Going in for another bite. Yeah, and it is just a really nice meal to be having in autumn when it is cool out. Good stuff, huh? I'm a big fan of this. I have to admit. I wasn't coming in with the highest expectations but this has won me over. Okay, so we are going to swap dishes. Sam is going in to my bowl. So I've been able to located where the rice is in the middle of the chicken. Oh la lah. So that is going to be my first bite. Rice has been located. Oh, that is some special rice. It has got a flavor to it. It is not plain and it is extra sticky. Extra glutinous. Yeah. That is just delicoius. I'm loving it so far. That is cool. And you know what else I noticed? Since this is more of a simple dish they've also given us a sauce over here. Yep. I think that is a ssamjang sauce (쌈장) and it looks like we also have kimchi (김치) and we have peppers. Want to try some of that? Yeah, I'm going to try some of that with chicken. Okay. Okay, time to try some of the chicken. And I don't know if you're supposed to do this but I am putting it in to the ssamjang (쌈장). That is how you're doing it. That is how we're rolling. I'm sure we could probably just plop some of it in the soup as well. So that has got red pepper paste and also soybean paste. So it should be a little bit of spice. Mmmmm. Wow. Yeah. It really tastes good with the ssamjang sauce (쌈장)..And that chicken is really tender. I know. It is so good. Now I'm going to taste the porridge. The juk (죽). So look at that. A lot thicker. It looks like there is some nuts and seeds in there. Alright. You're going to like this. I just have a feeling. Mmmmm. Mmmmm. Isn't that good. Oh my. The pine nuts. That is where the magic is happening. Isn't that good? What a nice addition. And you know what? I think I also had a raisin in there. Yeah, that might have been a raisin or it might have been the jujube. Kind of like a date. Mmmmm. Tasty? It is really good. I think I may like yours better. Hahaha. Of course you do. I always order the best one. You do. Time for the wishbone break session. Make a wish. One, two, three. Wait, I haven't made a wish. I forgot to make a wish. One. The wish. One, two, three. Uh. Try again. One, two, three. Oh, you got the long end. I got the wish. What is your wish? Well, I can't tell you. Hahaha. Don't worry it is good for both of us. I hope so. Boop. Alright, so we are done at this point. That was a very filling meal. And I have to say like I am sweating profusely from this. And I remember when I tried this in the summer like many years ago I was doing the same thing. I was sweating even more but this is definitely a kind of meal that makes you sweat afterwards. It is just piping hot and just the types of ingredients they have. But anyways on to price point. So it was both of these dishes were thirteen thousand Won (원). So in total twenty six thousand. ₩26,000 KRW. Which is about roughly twenty two, twenty one US dollars. So it was good value. I mean we're leaving full. It is not as cheap as some of the other Korean soups or stews but when you consider the ingredients involved - the ginseng, the chicken and whatnot you can see why it is is a bit more expensive. But definitely something we highly recommend and we came here not sure if we were going to like it or not and we're leaving big fans. I think we would come back again soon if we can. So it is dinnertime in the hood. Hello from Hapjeong (합정). Yeah, we're starving and we can't wait to have some Korean barbecue (고기구이). This time instead of pork or other types of meat we're going in for some chicken. Chicken. Spicy chicken awaits us. Alright, let's go. Sam is always scouting the area for new restaurants. Anything interesting? Seriously, I am. Well, I found a place that does Haemultang (해물탕) with I think is like a seafood stew. Oh. And we also found another Juk (죽) place that does Korean porridge and we found a tonne of barbecue places so we've got like options galore here. Oh la lah. Alright Sammy boy. What is happening tonight? What is happening is we're going to be having some spicy Korean barbecue chicken. Yes. And I can't wait for it to come. It is Dak Galbi (닭갈비) and it is a little bit different than the Dalk Galbi (닭갈비) we normally have, isn't it? So how would you explain the one that we normally have? Okay, so normally it is like a stir-fry. They cook it in a pot with potatoes and cabbage and whole bunch of other ingredients. Yeah, like rice cakes and different vegetables but this one is just going to be pure like meat on the grill. Chicken on the grill. Yeah. And you cook it yourself. And it has got the gochujang (고추장) sauce. The spicy red pepper sauce so we can't wait for that to come to the table. So while Sam is chugging on the beer I'm going to have some iced tea. Keeping things classy over here. If I can open the bottle. Oh my gosh. Please for the love of God. Hahaha. You know what, usually you get me to open bottles for you. I know. Oh wow. Look what is here. Here it comes the fire. Gamsahamnida. There it is. Oh my. So now. It is scary. Now it is just time for the chicken but before that comes. Yeah, you can put your hands by it. It is really cold. Today was the coldest day. It was freezing. In Seoul I think so far this fall. I think it was like a high of five or seven degrees so it is like winter is coming but it still it is just the turn of November so. How does it taste? Lovely now that the fire is here everything is good. Yeah, it is lovely but how is the drink taste? The drink is good. It is iced tea. Not sweet. So now we wait for the chicken to cook and just smell the lovely aromas. Um, okay so basically I think we're having chicken thighs because he took the pair of scissors and cut off the drumstick so those take a little bit longer to cook and then the rest of the meat will cook faster and it just smells so good. Right now. It smells awesome. So good. Like I just love that guchujang (苦椒醬) sauce. Yeah. It is going to be so good and so spicy. I know and the last meal I had today was breakfast. It was a late breakfast but I mean it has been a while. Like it is dark out so I'm ready for this. But we don't want to eat raw chicken so we wait. Alright, so until the chicken cooks I'm going to get started on the tofu. Yeah the banchan (반찬) here looks really good. Soft. Tofu in a spicy sauce. A huge piece of spicy tofu. Oh yeah. Good stuff? Mmmm. Spicy too? Mmm. Everything is spicy in this restaurant. I haven't had anything that didn't leave my mouth on fire. Especially the chicken. At long last. At long last. So it is ready to eat. Chicken. Here is the piece of Korean spicy chicken. So before I eat it I'm going to take it for a bit of a swim in the ssamjang ( 쌈장) sauce. So you're going to make it even more spicy? Make it even more spicy. I love this sauce. This is like the best sauce. It is a mixture of the gochujang (고추장) which is the Korean spicy sauce. The Korean red pepper sauce along with the soybean sauce. Alright Sam, you eat the lettuce with chopsticks. I know but I thought maybe it was cut a little bit bigger but no. No. It is really small. Now I will eat it with chopsticks. I'll tell you what I'll put the meat in and then I'll grab some lettuce. There you go. Oh yeah. Wow. That is super spicy. Really juicy, really tender and then I'm going to put it in a little bit of lettuce. Mmmm. Alright, so I'm going to wrap mine in this parilla leaf. And there we go. Mmmm. So what do you think? Is your tongue on fire? It is but like this kind of has like a minty flavor so it balances out the heat a little bit so I do like it. That is good. Can you really taste the gochujang (苦椒醬) sauce too? I didn't dip it in the extra sauce. Hahaha. But what is on it is enough. That is my level of spicy. And you're done. Stop there. That's good for you. So when the temperature drops in Korea I find myself appreciating Korean barbecue even more. Because it is so cold outside but when you come into the restaurant you warm up but then you get even warmer once you're by the grill. It is just like it is almost like being by a campfire or a stove. Your own little fireplace at the table. Yeah, it feels like my own little personal fireplace and once I get cozy here I don't even want to leave. I just feel like staying here. I don't want to walk back to my apartment. Okay, so round two is cooking on the grill. And it is kind of cool because every once in a while like a chunk of chicken fat will drop and the whole grill starts sizzling like it catches on fire. Woah. Yeah, the fire just comes right through the grill. It is pretty awesome. So much action at the table. But yeah, this is quite a bit of chicken to be honest. I always leave feeling stuffed by the end of it. It is one of my favorite parts, I don't know if it is one of your favorite parts but one of my favorite parts about any kind of Korean barbecue is the do it yourself at the table aspect. Yeah. I think it is so fun to be cooking the meat when it is in-front of you and it just makes it a more immersive experience and it is something that really makes Korean barbecue unique. Yeah. So how was that meal for you? That was awesome. We're full and like my tongue is literally on fire. Same here. At one point Sam was asking me are you cold are you sniffling? And I was like no my tongue is on fire. I feel like I'm like part dragon part human right now. But anyways in terms of the price point so the barbecue itself was twenty thousand Won (원). ₩20,000 KRW. And then the beer was extra four thousand Won (원). So in total it was ₩24,000 KRW which is about twenty US dollars. And that is awesome value for a barbecue like that. We're leaving stuffed and at that particular place that guy is really nice, very friendly very attentive service. So if you're around the Hapjeong (합정역) station area come check out this place. It is a really good barbecue. So it is time for yet another delicious meal here in Korea. Today we're having sundubu jjigae (순두부찌개) which is a tofu stew and this is probably my favorite Korean dish. It is so tasty and I can't wait for it to get here. So we're back here in Seoul (서울), Korea. We were here for all of August when it was like incredibly hot and humid and now we're back in the middle of October and this is like my favorite weather. I know it is cool. So nice! And we're staying in a totally different area. The last time we were staying near Seoul station and now we're near Hapjeong (합정) station which is actually near Hongdae a very popular area and near the Han River which is really cool. So we've been exploring lots of new restaurants here in the new hood. And you know what I think we've found our favorite place already right here. So you know what is the worst. When you have your camera set to slow motion and you've been recording this fantastic meal and you realize crap there is no audio and we're eating at like slow speeds so we're going to have to do this again. You know what I'm not the most articulate person and I thought I did a really good job of explaining this dish and it is all gone. Anyways, the food is here. We're having our Sundubu jjigae (순두부찌개) so if you take a look here it comes in this earthen ware pot and when it first came out it was still bubbling because it was fresh off of the stove so it was like pipping hot. It was still boiling but anyways here is the dish so look at all of those massive chunks of tofu. Yeah, this is all the fresh tofu. The soft tofu and they are so generous here. Like they give you so so much. The nice thing about the soft tofu is well is that it has less water content so that silken tofu. No, it has more water content that is why it is so jiggly. Of course. Yeah, the less water the harder it is. Oh my gosh. Yeah. But some of the other ingredients we also have some chives here. They have some zucinni, we have this massive dumpling. Usually when we order Sundubu jjigae (순두부찌개) it comes with clams and I'm not a huge fan of clams so I really like that this restaurant gives you this giant Mandu (만두) instead which is so cool. Look how big that is. It is a king sized Mandu (만두). Wang Mandu (만두) over there. Yeah. So what else is in here? Let's see. Oh, we also have a cracked egg. It is kind of like a poached egg. They just drop it in so it is still a little bit raw. You break it up and mix it around. The base is made out of Gochujang sauce which is the red pepper paste sauce. Yeah. And that is what gives it its spiciness and a lot of its kick. Yes, and we always eat this with rice. Always. Alright, try a bite. So you get a bit of rice on your spoon, little bit of soup. Take three. Hahaha. Mmmmm. That is so so good. It is my favorite dish. I love Sundubu jjigae (순두부찌개). Whenever I have a chance to eat this I go for it. So Sam is going in for the tofu. Going in for the Sundubu (순두부). Mmmm. Yeah, that is just delicious. Your eyes are watering a little bit. What is going on over there? The last bite I had the spice went down the wrong. The chili flake. Yeah, the windpipe or the wrong way. I have like chili flakes stuck in my throat. Oh my this is a dangerous dish. Yeah. But anyways in terms of of jjigae's there is a whole bunch of other jjigaes such as Doenjang jjigae, Kimchi jjigae this is also my favorite. The Sundubu jjigae (순두부찌개). And so this is something that we typically have like not on a daily basis but several times throughout the week. Yeah, so anyways on to the star of this meal. Let's open that up and see what is inside. It is a giant Mandu (만두). So I'm just going to plop it down on here dissect it with the chopsticks. Oh, dissection this is like science class except in a kitchen. Yep, and as you can see in here it has got all of the different meat, it has got different vegetables, ground meat. I can see chives in there. Yeah, it is kind of like. I'm going to try a bite. Yeah, love mandu (만두) so it is such a cool addition to this sundubu jjigae (순두부찌개) and I have to say this is not like a regular thing that you would put in here. This is quite a special addition that is unique for this restaurant. Yeah, we really lucked out finding this place because this is what they specialize in. Yeah, they're a mandu restaurant and we'll probably be back again to do a mandu video at some point. And you know what they are so good that they've actually been on television a few times. Yeah. Yeah, so you can see throughout the restaurant you see these like kind of newsreel type. Yeah. Yeah, it is really cool. So we're really enjoying the meal. Alright so I'm pouring myself some more of the Maekju (맥주) - the beer. Some Cass. Cass. And yeah this is one of the big four Korean beers that they have. There is Cass, OB, Hite and Cafri. So which one is the best? Well this is the only one they have here I think. Hahaha. I probably actually have OB and Hite more but this is still pretty good. Refreshing. Alright, so let's take a tour of the banchan (반찬) so we have a whole bunch of different things. We have vegetables over here, we have some different types of seafood and then of course we have kimchi (김치) and what makes this one of our favorite restaurants so far is the quality of the banchan (반찬). You can tell that it homemade, you can tell that it is really fresh and just the quality is exceptional so you get all of these nice side dishes to eat along with your Sundubu jjigae (순두부찌개). Feeling satisfied Sammy boy? Oh yeah. Polished that off. That feast of feasts is over. And now it is time for price point. So basically the two Sundubu jjigaes came to Six Thousand Won (원) each. And the beer was three thousand Won (원). So in total that was fifteen thousand Won (원). ₩15,000₩. Which roughly in Korean right now is 12 US dollars so that was a very affordable meal. We're leaving full, we're leaving satisfied and because this is one of our favorite restaurants you'll know we'll be back again soon. Well good evening good evening. It is starting to get dark a lot earlier here in Seoul. It is only 7 pm but it is like pitch black out. Yeah. Anyways, we're going for dinner. We're going to have a really healthy bibimbap (비빔밥). Yeah, this is kind of like a contemporary vegetarian take on traditional bibimbap (비빔밥) and we just discovered this restaurant a few days ago and it has become our new favorite restaurant now that we're staying back around Seoul station (서울역) again so. Yes, this is actually our third night in a row. Yeah, we're on a bit of a health kick so we'll show you why. Alright so we've already made a video about regular bibimbap (비빔밥). Tonight we're getting fancy. Yeah, tonight we're getting fancy and we ordered two different kinds. One is sundubu bibimbap (비빔밥) and that comes with a soft silken tofu. Yeah. And the other one we ordered is poseot bibimbap (비빔밥) which is a mushroom based bibimbap (비빔밥). Both are vegetarian. Both have ingredients that are quite different from normal bibimbap (비빔밥). And when the dishes arrive we'll give you a full tour and show you all of the different ingredients. Action. Alright, so the food has arrived and I get so excited about this meal because it so healthy and so tasty. So it is like really fun to eat it. So anyways take a look at the bowl. It is just like fresh raw ingredients. I have broccoli, I have red and yellow peppers. I have persimmon. Banana. Pumpkin. Grapes. Different types of of lettuce and cabbage. And then mushrooms and I think this on top is ground sesame seeds. That is what I read online but not entirely sure. And yeah, it is just so healthy. And look this is kind of like a two step meal. So you have to grab your dressing. Yep. So first you dress your salad. So unlike other bibimbap (비빔밥) where you have it all prepared for you. You just mix it yourself. This you actually have to put in your rice. Yeah, so it is a soy based sauce and you kind of dress your salad. So you do that first. Alright that is step one. What is step two? Step two. Oh, you've already uncovered your rice. I have. And this rice is different from normal plain rice. You call this kind of like a purple bean rice. Look at that. It is really pretty. It is healthier than normal rice. Okay, so first we have to mix this all together. You mix your vegetables. You mix your salad. Yeah and that helps you get the sauce evenly distributed. Spread it around. Banana. Did I mention we have a banana in here? There is fruit in here too. There is banana and grapes. There is also persimmon too. Once you have mixed your salad you add the rice. There we go. And you take some of the spicy red pepper paste. Yeah, the gochujang (고추장). Just. There. That's it? We like our spice. That is plenty. Are you kidding me? I would put on about double that amount but okay. And then we mix all of that around. Yep. That is the second step. Yeah, this is like fascinating bibimbap (비빔밥) because this is a dish I've had in so many different restaurants but I've never seen such a contemporary twist on it. Yeah. And it has ingredients that you'd never normally see. Yeah, like fruit. Yeah. I've never encountered fruit. Fruit in bibimbap (비빔밥) before. Walnuts and different things. So I'm going to go for some of the mushroom here. This is my first time ordering the mushroom one. Today I purposely tried to make it vegetarian but I normally get chamchi (참치) which is tuna. Woah. It is falling out. Falling. Mmmm. How is that? It was a good mushroom. Wow. Yes, this is your first time to try the mushroom on this right. Yeah, you've had the tuna or other types. Broccoli here. This is so healthy. So so good. Such healthy Korean food. Mmmm. Excellent. Okay, so before you dig in to yours do you want to show us what else we get with this? Sure, so before I mix my bibimbap (비빔밥) I'll show you the soup here. We have Miyeokguk (미역국) which is the Korean seaweed soup. Yep. It is really healthy. I'll try a little bit here. Mmmm. It is nice having warm soup on a cold night like this so. Okay..And we also get the kimchi. We get kimchi (김치). And we get eggs. Always. And hardboiled eggs with a little bit of salt and pepper that you can dip. Alright, so enough talking about that. Let's start mixing mine up. So I think the only difference in ours is that mine comes with tofu. Yeah, and mine has mushroom. Yep. So I'm just going to really give that a good mix. I'm going to slice up that banana. And you know what? I never would have thought banana would taste good in a bibimbap (비빔밥) but it actually is delicious. It does. It does. It almost makes it gives it some sweetness. So while you mix I should also mention you don't have to make it vegetarian. Like if you want you can also add chicken breast, octopus, they have tuna. They have pork so lots of different ingredients. Okay, time for my gochujang (고추장) sauce. Oh, and I'm going to put a lot on there. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I think Sam is going a little overboard. A little overboard but you're the one eating it. I would rather have it too spicy that not spicy enough. So I'm going to give that a really good mix. Oh, it has pumpkin as well. That is hobak (호박). And the colors. The colors are just so vibrant in this dish. Yeah, it is awesome. Ready to dig in? Ready to dig in. So I'm going to make sure I get a bit of tofu here and I'm going to try some pumpkin. Oops. And yeah the rice. Mmmm. Wow. That is nice and spicy. I just like this really is one of my favorite Korean meals and I love bibimbap (비빔밥) but now that I've found an alternative type of bibimbap (비빔밥) it has just really opened up a whole new taste bud experience. A whole new world of food here so this is fantastic. Alright, how was that dinner for yah? Oh, that was amazing. So healthy, so filling. But like normally I find when you're sometimes you know when you're sacrificing eating really healthy food there is a sacrifice with taste. But not that. That is so delicious. I swear I could probably eat that every night for a month and I wouldn't get sick of it. That is how much I like it. And it is also affordable too. Yeah. So it is only 6000 Won (원) each so 12,000 in total. W12,000 KRW.

El chori era tuyo? Si. Gracias. Tada. Come here. Para llevar. No necesito un plato, pero gacias. Okay, ready. So they have lots of different toppings but the right way to do this is with Chimichurri. So we're going to put lots of that. Let's add it on the bread to make it a little less messy. Pica. Si. Mi gusta picante. Si. Ah, bueno. Maybe a little bit on the meat. They're warning me that it is spicy. This is good. Yeah. All set. So we just got ourselves the quintessential Argentine street food snack. Have a look at this - the Choripan. Yeah, this is the best street food you're going to find in Buenos Aires. Yeah, so choripan gets its name because you basically have chorizo which is a sausage and then you have pan which is your bread. So put the two words together and you've got Choripán. Haha! And we put lots of chimichurri on ours because we like things spicy. So I'm just going to dig right in because this looks so so good. Yeah, we were thinking of getting two but then we saw someone else order. We saw the size of the choripan and we're like you know what we're just going to start with one. Yum. Look at that. Look at all of that sausage. Mmmm. That is so good. Wow. I'm really enjoying this right here. And you know what. You can grab this from a little street food cart. You don't even have to go to a restaurant. Like we're just walking along a park. We saw a whole row of those carts, went up there, they cook it right in front of us. And two minutes later it was ready. I'm going to let you try some Sam. So Sam this is your first time trying choripan on this particular trip. Yeah, I think I had it like a long time ago. Maybe five or six years ago but it has been such a long time that I honestly kind of forget what it tastes like. So this is an exciting moment. Dig right in. Mmmm. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Wow. How is that? Yeah, like you said that is a really good quality sausage. A really good Choripán. Yeah. And sorry I should say chorizo. A really good chorizo. And what really makes this good as well is that the quality of bread is high. Yeah, it is fresh bread. Yeah, and just before they served it they put the bread on the grill just to kind of soften it up a bit. Give it a bit more you know a smokey flavor as well. A bit more of a smokey flavor. Exactly. Yeah. And what do you think of all of the Chimichurri because people were looking at us like woah that is spicy. I think they were doing that because they thought we were you know foreigners and oh man they're making a mistake but we like our food spicy so the chimmichurri gives it an extra kick and I recommend you definitely put on some Chimichurri. Maybe not as much as us but definitely try it. Final thoughts then. What did you think of your choripan? I thought it was amazing. And that is by far the cheapest meal we've had in Buenos Aires since we've been here. That came in total for the one massive Choripan. That came to 25 Pesos. So you think about that. That is like that is just a couple bucks and you're having yourself one of the best kinds of street food you can get in the city. So if you're looking to pickup choripan where can you find it in Buenos Aires? Okay, so there are stands scattered across the city in different neighborhoods but today we are Avenida de Los Italianos which is kind of like Puerto Madero just before you hit the Ecological Reserve. So lots of stands in the area and you can find a lot more than just Choripan. Lots of different types of street food while you're out here. So we highly recommend it. Check it out. Havanna! So today we're going to Havanna to try Alfajores. This is like the it name in Argentina when you're looking to try alfajores. And the ones we're going to be eating are quite different from the ones we've tried elsewhere in South America. So let's just stop talking about it and go in and try them. We're hungry people. Come along. Check this out. It was actually a little bit embarrassing ordering this because the waitress was looking at me like, really? You want to try all of them? There is six of them. So we kind of look like little pigs. Well, we are. If we're doing a taste test we have to try every single variety. And they have six at this cafe. So we had to do it. Had to be done. But, anyways, um, what is an alfajor? I guess that is the big question. So it is basically like two crumbly cookies that are smooshed together, usually with dulce de leche or some kind of different filling. And then they can covered in like icing sugar or chocolate or meringue. So it is a really nice treat. You can have it for breakfast, in my opinion, I would totally eat these for breakfast. Or as a little snack. It is actually a really popular snack with kids. This is what they take to school. So an interesting fun fact. Argentine's consume the most alfajores per capita and total of anywhere else in the world. It is our favorite. They're considered to be the most popular snack among school children and also adults. So you get hooked early on and it is a lifelong fun addiction. So why did we choose Havanna to go get our Alfajores? Because this is the most established name in the whole country. The company was founded in 1948 in a nearby city called Mar Del Plata. And as I was saying earlier these are my favorite brand of alfajores. This is what I think of when I remember sweet snacks of my childhood. It is your Dad's favorite brand too. Yeah. So, let's get started. Let's start opening them. Let's try them. Come on. Okay, so we are going to start with the classic. This one is filed with dulce de leche and then bathed in chocolate. Tada. Look at thing of beauty. Thing of beauty. And we're going to cut them in half because it is our intention to share. And also to show you what is inside. Let's see that. So there you go. Two cookies with dulce de leche in the middle and chocolate on the exterior. Let's just dig right in. Mmmmm. Oh, yeah. This is what I've been waiting for. A real authentic alfajor. And there is yet another flavor to sample. Yes. So what is this one, Sam? I think this one may be the dark chocolate one. Yeah. That's really good. So is it bitter? Like is it bitter dark chocolate? It is surprisingly got a decent amount of sugar added. I mean, I still prefer the milk chocolate but this is a really good one. Maybe for those who are looking for something a little bit more healthy. Hahaha. Yeah, you can lie to yourself. Yeah. Okay, next up this one is dulce de leche and it is covered with meringue. This is my favorite. Like this is the one I order anytime I'm in the Havanna coffee shop. Look at that. Thing of beauty. Mmmm. The meringue is just perfect. I forgot to cut this one in half. Sorry, Sam! That is evil. That was intentional. Look at that. Alright, and I have a feeling that this one is the chocolate lovers. I think it has a chocolate cream in the middle. So let's cut that one in half. I'll actually remember to do that this time. And yes it is just pure chocolate. I'm getting it all over my hands. It is kind of warm in here so the chocolate keeps melting on our fingers before we can even eat it. Yeah, that is nice and chocolate-y. So if you're not a huge fan of jam or dulce de leche this is the one for you. This is for chocolate lovers. Alright, next up this one is filled with jam. And oh my goodness this is also meringue. This makes me very happy. It is your lucky day. Lucky girl. Okay, so I'll cut it in half Oh, wow. That looks like a jam. Have a look in there. So, yeah, that is a dark jam. Let's see. Mmmmm. Okay. This is called membrillo and it is a quince jam which isn't really very popular fruit in North America but you'll find it everywhere here in Argentina. They use it a lot in pastries. And it is really nice. It is a dark reddish color. It's good. Does it have a strong flavor? It is a like a little bit tart but they obviously add a lot of sugar in. So, I like it. And last but not least. Oh, look. I don't know if this one is meringue or if it is white chocolate. Oh, it is white chocolate. So this one is the one that has nuts. This has Brazil and walnuts. Oh, look at that. I think it has dulce de leche inside. This one may be my favorite. Is it dulce de leche or is it a nut cream? It's dulce de leche. Is it? The face says it all. Of course it is dulce de leche. This is my favorite one. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Favorite of the bunch. Whenever you add a high quality nuts like that and then you have white chocolate and dulce de leche. That is just the all-time winning combo. This one was made just for me I think. So that was a lot of sugar consumption so early in the day. Yeah, I think I'm going to be on a sugar high for pretty much the rest of the day unless I crash. Okay, so let's talk about price point and how much did these cost individually. So these are really affordable. You're basically looking at 19 Pesos. Actually that was the price for every single one of them. So that is roughly about a $1.25 to $1.30 US. So really cheap. You can come in here and if you want to be greedy as us order all six and you can get them for under 10 bucks. Yeah, they are actually the most expensive alfajores you can get in the whole city. Like are much cheaper brands if you're looking for something a bit more affordable. That is true but you won't find too many that better quality than these ones. Yeah. Dun dun dun dah dah That was a long wait but we've got ourselves some ice cream. Well, was that worth the wait? Yes, it sure was. So this video is about ice cream because Buenos Aires has some of the best ice cream we have ever tried. And our favorite place to go to is Freddo. We found this place towards the start of our visit and we've been coming like every other day. Hahaha. Shoosh. Don't tell anyone. Um, but yeah, so we ended up getting some ice cream this afternoon. And what you see here is a quarter of a kilo. So this is 250 grams of ice cream and you get to choose three flavors. So this one here is Forest berries. Look at that. Mmmm. And that is actually my favorite flavor at Freddo. I order it every time I come here. And it is like really thick and creamy and it has a rich vanilla flavor but it also has chunks of real fruit. And I couldn't tell you what the forest berries are. I don't know if it is blackberries or blueberries. It could be anything. But it is delicious. As for the flavors, I'm having raspberry, and this is like a raspberry sorbet so it is a little bit watery instead of being like creamy. So I kind of like it because it is refreshing. And on this side for my third flavor I chose strawberry. Some might say that is a little boring but whatever. I like strawberry. That's almost vanilla. Hahaha. Mmmm. Yeah. But my favorite has got to be this one on the side. Forest berry for the win. And all of Sam's flavors have dulce de leche because he just loves that schizz. I'm addicted. What can I say. I eat way too much dulce de leche. Yeah, I think I'm going to by the time I go back to Canada I'm going to be experiencing withdrawal symptoms so. Okay, so there is three different kinds. So first let's go for the classic dulce de leche. That is just pure dulce de leche. Mmmmm. Oh, that is amazing. So rich, so creamy, sweet and a little bit salty too. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's kind of cool that they add a little bit of salt because sometimes that helps the sweetness come through. Yeah, I know. I agree. When you have that contrast. Oh, this one is really thick. This is the brownie one? This is dulce de leche with chunks of brownie. Dulce de leche con brownie. That is like major chunks. Mmmmm. Wow. Those are real chunks of brownie. Okay, and let's go in for the third bite. Now this is the one I'm curious to try because I've never tried this. I really like both of these flavors. This is coconut and dulce de leche. Oh, that's good. Wow, I've never had those flavors together before. I don't think I've ever add had coconut ice cream before. What? You're missing out. Is it creamy? Yeah, it is one of the creamy. I'd say it is creamier than vanilla ice cream like. And the flavor, oh. Oh, yeah. Well, we sure had no trouble finishing that off. Yeah, when it comes to ice cream there is not going to be any left on the table that is for sure. Yeah, and now the big question is what makes Argentinian ice cream so delicious? And the truth is we don't know. It is like really special. It is a secret. There must be some secret recipes over here. It is just extra creamy. Yeah, I think it is the quality of ingredients. I think it is the cream that they use, I think it is the attention to detail. I find that the flavors are really creamy and rich but there is not an over amount of sugar. It tastes natural. Like, exactly. They've just really got the formula down. And it just it really is world class ice cream and gelato. It is the best. You've got to try it. I think it is better than the stuff we've tried in Italy. Like that is incredible. Woah. Now that is putting it out there. Okay, and let's talk about price point. We had a quarter of a kilo. Those cups were 250 grams and that was 85 Pesos each. Yeah, so you're looking at like close to maybe $6 US dollars. So not cheap but you're coming here to pay for quality. This place is like the best of the best. Yeah, you could get cheaper ice cream but this is really good. Yeah, but why would you want to do that. Yeah, splurge a little. Exactly, go here and get three different kinds. #eatArgentina Alright, so for today's meal we're eating at a place called Cumaná in Buenos Aires. And this restaurant specializes in Northern Argentine food. So these are dishes that you might find in the region of Salta or Jujuy. And the truth is that when we were traveling in Northern Argentina we didn't actually eat a lot of Northern Argentine food aside from empanadas. So it'll be interesting to finally sample those dishes in the capital. So the food came rather quickly. It is already at the table. And since it is a bit of a cooler day outside we decided to both order stews. I'm having one that is called Locro. And it kind of comes in this metal bowl that is really hot and I already made the mistake of touching it. So that won't happen again. But here you can see it is like really thick. You can see the chunks of corn in there. Wow. You have some spring onions, a little bit of spice. That looks so good. Yeah, you'll have to stir it around. Yeah, let's mix it all in. That's probably how you're supposed to eat it anyway. I'd say. So let's mix it all in. And look at that. So it has different cuts of meat as well. I believe this one has pork and beef. So it is very very hearty and as you can see it is still steaming. Like this is piping hot. So maybe I'll give it a few minutes to cool down. Blow on it. Time to dig in. So look at that. There is even sausage in the stew. I had totally missed that when I was mixing it earlier. So let's get a bit of everything. We've got corn, we've got sausage. Mmm. Wow. Pleasantly surprised. Mmmm. It is very rich and thick. It is like a nice stew. It is the type of dish you'd want to have on a winter's day. And it is also a little bit spicy. I'm not entirely sure what that red sauce was. But it is giving a little bit of a kick which is nice. So yeah, I'm happy with my dish. First time trying locro and I think it is a success. Okay, so Sam you're having something called Carbonada Criolla which is also stew. Yes, and mine appears to be piping hot as well. It kind of has the texture and appearance of a chili. It look a bit like chili. And mine has got carrots and it has got corn. It has got beef. Let's try that. A little bit of everything. Yours seems to have more vegetables than mine. Oh, that is delicious. I'm honestly usually not the biggest fan of stews but this is like almost as thick as a chillie. Yeah. Yeah. It is really good and it is quite sweet too. Yeah, and it is really the perfect weather to be having this. It is. It is a little bit rainy these past few days. And I like that it has got a generous amount of meat. And you taste the corn and the carrots a lot. And there is also potato in there as well too. So yeah, this is the perfect dish for us to be having on a cold day in Buenos Aires. And the icing on the cake is that they brought us homemade bread. So check that out. Have a bite of that. And it is like a nice thick slice. And it is a heavier bread. It is really nice. That is come in good with the stew. That's good homemade bread. And pretty much every meal you've been having here in Argentina has been paired with wine. Well, it is just so cheap and so good. I mean the quality of Argentine wine is fantastic. And their national grape, the one that they're most famous for, is producing a Malbec wine. And this is a 2013 Lopez. And this is I can't remember exactly what the price was but it was really cheap. So, you know what I'm just going to indulge while I'm in Buenos Aires. You're turning into quite the wine connoisseur. That's good stuff. So everyone watching our videos has already seen us try savory empanadas but today we're having sweet ones for dessert. Yeah, and I don't know how I have any room considering how hearty that stew was. I am full from all of that wine too. We are going to try some special ones. These are very unique. This one has dulce de leche. That amazing milk caramel cream. Oh, look at how thick it is. Look how thick that is. I can't wait to try a bite of that. Oh, it is going to be so good. Anything with dulce de leche is good. I didn't even realize you can have this in empanada form. I thought it was just for cakes. We've tried a few sweet ones but never with this before. Oh, that smile says it all. That is just too good. We should have ordered like five of those. I'm full but that is just so amazing. Call the waiter over. Yep. Alright, and we're supposed to get you filming the other one but you're just so excited to try the dulce de leche one. That we need to see your reaction. Mmmm. That is good. It is like as not as creamy. I guess it has been cooking for a lot longer so it is thicker. And they've also drizzled a bit of syrup on top. That is a really nice combination. Okay, but let's move on to the next one. Now this one is really special. This is called Cayote. And it is a fruit that you find in Northern Argentina. I've never seen it before. But I asked the waiter to kind of try and compare it to something and he said it is kind of like a watermelon. Except it is white and that then when you boil it you kind of get these fibers. And you just cook it with sugar and it turns into this like really sweet jam. And they use it as a filling for empanadas. So, it is called Cayote. My first time trying this. Sam tried Cayote ice cream when we were traveling in Salta. Yeah, it is very sweet. Mmmmm. Wow. How is that? Honestly, that is really good. I almost feel like I'm having apple pie. To me it tastes a lot like a sweet apple filing. And the crust kind of reminds me of a pie. Apple pie guys. That is the best way I can describe it. So Sam seems pretty pleased with the price. Would that be accurate? Yes, that was a fantastic price. 282 Pesos, so that is less than 20 US dollars and for that amount of money we got two massive stews, we got the soda siffon, I get a generous bottle of wine and we got two dessert empanadas. And I have to say that the quality here was fantastic. Even the bread that was served prior to our meal was a really good homemade quality bread. This is one of my new favorite restaurants in all of Buenos Aires. And if you'd like to come here you know the exact Address. It is. And if you'd like to come here it is at the intersection of Avenida Santa Fe and Rodriguez Pena on the north side. Yeah, so hunt it down and definitely come and have a lunch here. So we are on a bit of a pizza mission this afternoon. Sam had a very disappointing meal in Boca and he's been sulking ever since. So pizza will cheer him up. We're back in our neighborhood. We're staying in Recoleta and there is a pizza place that was recommended to us by our Airbnb host. So we are here and it is called El Cuartito and we've ordered five different slices of pizza. This should be good. Are you happy, Sam? Yes. So you know this place is going to be good because it has been approved by an Italian. Correct. Yes, our Airbnb host, one of her friends from Naples, Italy came here. And that place is known for pizza. And she said this was the best pizza she has ever had, so I have super high expectations. And I always love getting recommendations from locals. We often find that the best restaurants, the best food we ever had is from those kinds of recommendations. So this is exciting. Oh, yes. Pizza time. Very exciting. Pizza time. And those are five sexy delectable slices of pizza. Will this make up for today's lunch? I think it might. Woo hoo. So Sam is going for the Fugazetta. This thing looks like a thing of beauty. It's got mozzarella, double cream cheese and onions. Oh, I've never had pizza with cream cheese before. So let's dig right in there. That looks so cheesy. That is like the cheesiest pizza I've ever seen. I know, I know. Look at the look on his face. Look at those eyes. That is insanely good. Insanely good. That is just like cheese explosion. That is for any kind of cheese lover this is like the best moment of his or her life. So I'm pretty excited for this one. Look at that thick tomato sauce. Thick thick tomato sauce and anchovies on top. This is going to be good my friends. The anchovies fell off. Ah! There we go. Any anchovy lovers out there? Mmmmm. Anchovies are always super salty so it has a real salty kick to it. And of course a bit of a fishy flavor. Haha. That's good. I know anchovies are not a favorite with everyone but I do enjoy it on pizza. So time for slice number three. Yes, and this one over here is a vegetarian pizza. Yeah. And apparently it comes with an alfredo sauce so I'm really looking forward to that. Yeah, this is a bit unusual. No tomato sauce on this one. Just a cream based sauce. It looks like there is tonnes of spinach. Maybe a bit of onions oozing out. Popeye. Mmmm. That is really unique. It is very different to not have a tomato sauce or even more of a cheesy sauce. This tastes a bit more like a lasagna. It does. Exactly. It tastes like a bit of a creamy lasagna. Oh, let's get a closer look at that. Cheesy. Okay, slice number four. This one is called Napolitana and it has tomato sauce but it also has slices of fresh tomato on top. And two different kinds of cheese. Provincial and Parmesan. Not too shabby. Not too shabby at all. Mmmm. How might that be? That's good. I was expecting to like this one and I'm a fan. It may be my favorite so far. I really like the fresh tomatoes. They're just so juicy. It makes the pizza extra special. Oh, yeah. Okay and the last one. And this lonely little last pizza slice. Actually it is anything but little. This one has ham, pepper and loads of mozzarella. So let's give that a try. Dig right in. Oh yeah, big slice. He eats like a caveman. This one is one of my favorites. Like this is a winning combo. Oh yeah. That mozzarella is awesome. It is just so much piled on. So fresh, so tasty. And the ham is really tasty as well too. And I like the look of the pepper. Like in North America they usually give you those thin slivers. But here it is like a big slice. Just slap it right on. Slap it right on. Oh yeah. So this might seem a little piggy but yet another slice arrived. It is piggy. It is piggy. Slice number six. You know what. This pizza is so good that I couldn't walk out of here having just had five slices shared between two people. So we have ordered a 6th one. We're getting one more Napoletana. Napoletana. Napolitana. So I guess it is official. This was our favorite out of the five slices we tried? Yeah, it was. It's a classic flavor. What I mean they're all so good though. I mean like you could have given me any extra slice of any of those ones that we ordered and I would have been happy. Big bite. Fresh out of the oven. Final thoughts. Final thoughts. The pizza was amazing. The place is backed and it is at a great price.You can get each slice for $2 Canadian dollars which is a really good deal and those are like really thick slices with lots of cheese. So I would highly recommend it. Come, check it out. El Cuartito. This may be the best pizza in Buenos Aires. I think so. Cafe Tortoni first opened its doors in 1858, and it was named after a Parisian cafe by the same name. The place gained great notoriety in the mid-1920s when it was frequented by a mix of writers, painters, musicians, poets, journalists, philosophers, inventors, and other creative minds. Today it's a must-visit cafe for visitors passing through Buenos Aires. Where are we? Well for today's meal we are at Café Tortoni. Which is one of the oldest and most famous cafeterias in the whole city. I think locals would probably tell you this is very touristy, because it is only tourists with their cameras sitting in here, but regardless it is a place I think you should visit. Like the architecture is really cool. The furniture is kind of like frozen in time. And also they make a pretty good hot chocolate. That's what I've got right here. I ordered chocolate con churros. Let me use this other hand. Let me use my strong hand...hahaha That is a big thing of coffee. Is that cream beside it too? Yeah and I got frothy milk on the side. But look at how thick that is. There is like some chocolate chunks in there. Do it from higher up. There we go. Okay, I should probably stop there. And I ordered that with churros. Which is kind of like a long strip of dough that has been deep-fried. Yeah, it is kind of like a deep-fried Spanish doughnut. Yeah, and it has granulated sugar sprinkled on top. And they've put a lot in here. And of course, you have to dip it in the chocolate. It has to be done. It is the only way to go. That is my lunch today guys. Hot chocolate. Healthy. Mmmmm. That is good. I almost wish you could use this as a straw to drink the hot chocolate. But this is actually one of their specialties here. They have two specialties of the house. One is called leche merangada which we've ordered. But this is really good. I can see why it is one of the suggested dishes. So yeah, look at that. Look at how is soaks up the chocolate. It is like a sponge inside. Like a thick sponge. Mmmm. And what do you have over there? And I've gone for the tostada. And that is basically a sandwich that has tomato, ham and cheese. And it is like a grilled cheese sandwich. Yeah, but this is premium because of the ham. Yeah, so it is usually just ham and cheese but this one is called tostada Tortoni just because they've added the tomato. So that is there special. The tomato gives it little bit of an extra kick and more juiciness. Juicy. You've got crumbs all over your face. We like our juicy food. Yeah, and actually while you were filming your surroundings I got hungry. Hey, cheater. Cheater. I started eating without you. So we also ordered something called leche merengada because it is one of their other specialties here. But from the description I thought it was going to be milk that tastes like meringue. But that looks like ice cream. Yeah, it does. It looks like there is cinnamon sprinkled over it. Ooh. So it should taste like meringue unless they've mixed up our order. And we wouldn't know. Yeah, it is kind of like ice cream. Is it meringue flavored ice cream? Yeah, it is. Okay, and the cool thing is that there is so much cinnamon put on top. And I mean I love cinnamon. I can smell it from here. From across the table. And that came with a little wafer. I'm going to get another bite with my spoon. So yeah it is a pretty cool place to stop for a little snack. I can see why that is the house specialty. I'm guessing that is homemade. Definitely tastes homemade. Okay, so we've polished everything off. Yes, except for the milk because we don't want to dilute our chocolate. And here is the bill. It came to 299 and that included the chocolate churros, the balon which is the beer, the merengada which is the ice cream and tostada tortoni which of course was the sandwich. So that is a little bit pricey. Touristy prices here. But you know what still not that bad. That is like $20 US dollars for four items on the menu. Yeah, and you're paying for the ambiance. Yes, you are. De las Salteñas la mejor! The best in Salta. Yum, yum! So it is our last day in Salta and we couldn't leave the city without having empanadas. We did a little bit of research on Google and we found a place called La Criollita. Apparently, they have the best empanadas in the whole city so that is what we're going to be ordering today. Okay, so the specialty here are called empanadas Salteñas. Yes, and those are made with chopped beef but what are we having? But we also saw two others that caught our eye. One is with pollo which is chicken and the other one is with queso which is cheese. So we're going to try 3. Three, a little bit of everything. We even ordered a tamale too. Yes, yum yum. And just as we're getting ready to vlog our meal the power goes out in the restaurant. So this is going to be low quality filming. We're not sure what we're going to do. Maybe we'll wait for the power to come on or maybe we'll just film it guerrilla style. Fingers crossed. Okay, so we can still kind of see in the dark. So here are the three empanadas. They have arrived. And this one is made with beef. This is a traditional one. Empanadas Salteña. This one is made with cheese. And this round one over here is made with chicken. So we'll be sampling those in the dark. In the dark. In the dark all spooky and scary. In the dark. So this one here is the empanadas Salteñas. This is the beef one. Um, and this is going to be a proper taste test because I can't really see that well in here. So, I have to figure out what the ingredients are. Yep. Just for our viewers to understand we have the exposure compensation lightened by two degrees so it is a lot lighter on the screen that you're seeing than it actually is for us trying this. I've got the spicy one. It does have a bit of a kick. Okay, so what kind of sets this one apart from other beef empanadas is that the beef is chopped. So you get like these bigger chunks of meat. It is not ground beef like in the other ones. And this one also has potatoes and spring onions in it. Oh la lah! Oh, it is so hot. Is it tasty? Is it tasty? Potato and egg. Really tasty but this is like fresh out of the oven. Piping hot. Want to try some? Yes, I do. Okay, so Sam is adding some spice to this already spicy empanada. Because apparently it wasn't spicy enough. Just kidding. How is that? That is really really good. I think what sets this empanada apart is just number one if you look here you can see just how stuffed it is. Like, you can kind of see. I'll explain. We'll trust you. We'll take your word for it. So it is stuffed with ingredients and the quality of meat is really high. And you're right, it is spicy. Like I'm feeling it burn even though I had a bite about ten seconds ago. It gets a thumbs up. Big thumbs up. Okay, so next up we have the cheese one. Con queso. Right? Yeah. That's like a mozzarella cheese. Oooh. Is it a generous amount of cheese? Mmm hmmm. You can't really see the strings forming but it is super cheesy in there. Yeah. I wish you could capture this. Look at all of that cheese oozing out. Out of focus. That's okay. Tasty. I'm used to having empanadas with ham and cheese. I've never had one which is just strictly cheese before but it's a nice little snack. And last but not least we have the chicken. And this one is in a different shape. It's more like round. It's like a pie. Yeah, it's like a little pie. Chicken pot pie. Wow! I can see why this place is considered one of the best if not the best in town. Like they have thick chunks of meat in their empanadas. So my first bite into the side which typically you wouldn't think would have a lot of ingredients included a really big tender piece of chicken. This is awesome. I think we're going to be ordering more of these before we go home. So one of the things that really surprised me about the empanadas here in Salta is that they're quite small. They're almost like a little snack or a little appetizer that you'd have before the meal. But the ones that we generally make at home and I'm guessing we use in Argentine recipe in my house are usually a little bigger and they're quite plump. And they're not as big as the ones we had in Chile. Those are like massive that look like envelopes. But yeah these are like little treats. I feel like I need to eat five or six of these to actually get full. It's like they should have an 'itas' added to the end. Itas, Empanaditas. That means they are little. Alright, so this isn't quite the meal we were expecting to have. Sitting here in the dark in the back of a restaurant. But let's do price point because we are done with our food. Yes, so the good thing if you do come here these are not expensive at all. They're roughly 1 US dollar - 12 to 13 pesos. And I highly recommend coming with a friend and ordering a whole bunch. Yes, you need at least five. At least five per person. At least, five. Maybe more like ten if you're a hungry giant like me. Yeah, because we got three and a tamale and we're still kind of hungry. We're going to order more. Let's go for dessert. #eatArgentina So we've ventured away from our neighborhood for today's food video. We are currently in Palermo. And we're eating at a place called Don Julio. This is a parrilla which means they focus on grilled meats. And it is a bit more upscale than the one we normally go to over in Recoleta. So it should be an interesting experience. See if you like it Sam. Good? Esta bien. So let's just take a minute to talk about the tablecloth. Yeah, so the first thing we noticed was just how like thick and durable. Like this is leather cowhide. Also, it is cool just the way that the sauces are presented here. We've got chimmichurri, we have the salsa and then over here the butter. And show us that steak knife. Oh, yeah, this thing. This thing is incredible. This is actually heavy. I've never had any kind of knife that has felt as solid in my hands. Yeah, you can buy them at the restaurant but they're like 800 Pesos. It feels more like a dagger. It is a weapon. It is a weapon. So we've got some bread fresh out of the oven. Look at that. I wonder if they make it here themselves because this thing is like piping hot. Ooh. A nice way to start the meal. I just blew crumbs across the table. Alright, so time to put the knife to good use. I'm cutting in to the bife de lomo. And this is our tenderloin which is nice and juicy. They way I like it. Mmmmm. Oh, wow. Honestly, that just melts in your mouth. That is probably the most tender tenderloin we've had to date in Argentina. I'd have to say. But let's add some chimichurri. Don't forget the chimmichurri. Can't forget that. Let's see. Oh, lots of chimichurri there. That's going to be nice and garlic-y. Flavorful. Mmmmm. Look at that piece of meat. I love how easy that knife just penetrates the meat. It is just so tender. It is like cutting through butter. It is like cutting through butter with that knife. Oh yeah. That's a nice piece of meat. Yeah, I can totally see why it is so highly rated. Now we know why it is popular. So this is our first time having grilled veggies with steak. What do you think? Yeah, I think I may even prefer it to salad. It is just juicier and I don't know it just brings out the flavors more when they're grilled. Especially the zucchini. It's awesome stuff. Alright, so we just finished up that meal. How are you feeling? Yeah, it was really good quality steak that is for sure. The portion was quite a bit smaller than what we had at Parrilla Pena though. And to be perfectly honest I prefer the taste at Parrilla Pena as well too. Okay, and what about the price? The price was over 700 Pesos. So this was not a cheap meal. I think we were looking at something over 50 US dollars total for the meal. But you know we are in a fancier neighborhood. Yeah. And this place is really popular with tourists. Yes. So we kind of have that coming. It is a very touristy restaurant. Yeah. But I prefer the neighborhood feel of say a local parrilla compared to somewhere like this. This was a cool experience because this was kind of our first time at a more upscale kind of grill. Fancy spot. But I definitely prefer Parrilla Pena. That is still my all-time favorite spot to get a good steak in Buenos Aires. #eatArgentina So it is five PM here in Buenos Aires which means it is tea time or as we call it here it is Merienda time. So, we're at a little place called La Biela. This is a really famous cafe across from the Recoleta Cemetery. We've got a table, we've ordered our food. And a special surprise should be coming. I'm not going to tell you what Merienda consists of until it gets here. So apparently this place used to be a really popular hangout with race car drivers and celebrities who are into racing back in the 30's. So you can kind of get a feel for that in the decor. They have a lot of dated cars and tools on the walls. And you can even see that on the napkin. They've got like a little race car. Look at that fancy napkin. Some tools. La Biela. Fancy. And apparently La Biela is the name of a tool that you use to work on cars. So, yeah that is where it comes from. So would you say you've gotten used to the Argentinian eating schedule? Yeah, I mean it is completely different from what we're used to back home. Back home in Canada five o'clock would be dinner. Maybe five thirty would be dinner. But here that is strictly teatime. Tea and sweets. Just a light snack to carry over to 10 pm. Dinner doesn't even really get started until 10, 11 maybe even 12 here. So, yeah. It is tea time. Food dance. The food has arrived. Anyways, there is like waiters starring at me. The food is here which is super exciting for us. So have a look over here. Um, this meal that we ordered it comes with two croissants. So we'll be sharing those. These are called medialunas. And they are sweet buttery media lunas. I love these. And it also comes with a tostado jamon y queso. Which is a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. Yeah, those are really good. We've been having a lot of those in Buenos Aires. Yeah, so super thin, lightly toasted. They are kind of your staple snack sandwich in Argentina, aren't they? So let's start with this. Something savory first and then we'll move on to the desserts. Oh yeah. That's good. Just a very thin layer of ham and cheese. Super light. Like I could probably eat ten of these I mean they are so thin and light. But yeah, good stuff. So I guess technically we should be calling this coffee time not tea time. Because neither of us is having tea. Well, in Argentina - especially in Buenos Aires - coffee seems to be a bit more popular than tea. Yeah, and I love the coffee here. What is so cool about the coffee is that it always comes in these really big cups. Like you get a generous portion. It is not like one of those little dinky little servings that you sometimes get in other countries. They give you a nice generous portion of coffee. So it is time to actually try that. It is actually heavy in my hands. Oh man, good stuff. You know what, neither of us were really coffee drinkers until I think the past year maybe year and a half. And now we actually come to appreciate good quality coffee. It is funny. And next up we have this sweet medialuna. Let me just break it in half so you can have a look in there. Look at how fluffy that is. Mmmm. So good. So sweet. It has like a light coating, a light glaze on top which is just perfect. Very buttery, fluffy, light. I love these. Again, I could probably have like five, six or seven of these no problem. And our order came with three different slices of pastries, cakes, pies, whatever you want to call it. Sweet treats. So why don't we explain what there is. So this one here has chocolate and I think kind of a cracker filling with dulce de leche. You want to hold it up and show us. Yeah, sure. It is a really thick bar. Check that out. Fancy. So we'll put that down for a moment. Okay. And over here we've got it appears to be like kind of a slice of apple pie. But what is cool about this pie is that it has like a white glaze. A glaze over top of it. Some extra sugar in there. No complaints about that. And last but not least we have this. So that is called Pionono. It is a mini pionono. And it is kind of like a little roll with dulce de leche in the middle. Yeah, and anything with dulce de leche is a hit with us. Okay, enough yackity yack yack already. Let's try something. So I've got a piece of apple pie. Oh yeah. I want to try some of that. It looks good with the extra glaze on top. That is some good stuff. Yes, the extra glaze is what really makes it unique. And also the quality of the apples. These are really high quality apples. And it is also quite sweet as well. There is quite a bit of sugar so we will be on a sugar high this afternoon. Alright, now let's move on to this chocolate bar over here. I'm curious about that. I'm just going to pick it up. Yeah, just take a big bite. Just pick it up, take a bite. I'm going to try to get lots of dulce de leche here. Mmmm. That is the definition of decadent. Yeah? Yeah. You know what, I don't know what we're going to do when we leave Argentina. Like when we can't get dulce de leche desserts anymore. I'm going to be very deprived and very sad boy. We'll have to stuff jars in our suitcases. That is what we'll do. Okay, and now last but not least where is that pionono? Let's get a bite. Wow, you're really making me go on a roll here. No, help? I've had the croissants and I had the sandwich. Show us how it is done. Alright. Mmmmm. Let's get a look at that. Come show us. There you go. I was too busy biting into it. Yeah, let us appreciate the beauty. Anyway, again, dulce de leche layer upon layer. Swirling layers. It is good. It is time to go now. Say bye Sam. Bye buddy. It has been a good experience. You do need to clean your teeth though. Yeah, he does. But anyways, let's talk about the price of that meal. Yeah, so it was just over 200 Pesos. So you're looking at roughly 13-14 US dollars. Fantastic value. All of the things we had were really high quality including the sandwich, the croissants, the cakes and all of the pastries. And good quality coffee on top that too. Everything was good. Everything was good. Come here. #eatArgentina So this afternoon we're going to be making a dessert video. We are going to be trying something called Queso y Dulce or Postre Vigilante. I'm going to show you the ingredients right now. It is probably going to look a little bit gross but trust me this is delicious. Yeah, okay. So basically we're going to be having fresh cheese which is really creamy. It comes sealed in this plastic bag and we're also going to be trying it with these three desserts. So this right here is called dulce de batata and it is a sweet made out of sweet potato. This one is called dulce de membrillo and it is made out of quince. And this one is dulce de zapallo which I've never seen before. But it is made out of pumpkin. So basically we're going to be slicing a piece off of these three sweets, as well as cheese and you just eat it together. So that was a little bit messier than I care to admit. I think it is because we bought the product in these you know vacuum sealed packages so it makes it a little bit hard to get them out. But you can also buy it in tins. Actually when I was younger my family used to buy the five kilo tins of dulce de batata. Woah. So if you like that stuff you can buy it in large quantities. I bet those didn't last very long in your house. No, they didn't. But have a look. This is the presentation. Not too shabby. But of course if you ask for this dessert at a restaurant the portion would be a lot larger. Like this is a smaller size. It's a sampler portion. Sampler plate. But let's dig in. So I'm going to start off with my favorite which is dulce de batata. This one is sweet potato one. So we've arranged this so we each get a bite of the three. Of all three of them. Sam's afraid I'm going to eat his. He's like trying to move them away. These are mine. I know how you roll, so. Mmmmmm. Oh, yeah. Mmmmmm. You know the cheese we got is really fresh and it almost has like a hint of saltiness in the background so it is a really nice combination. It really helps the sweetness of the sweet potato come through. So yeah the sweet potato one gets the thumbs up from me. I love it. Let's move on to the next one. This one is dulce de membrillo which is the quince jam. It is a darker color. Mmmmm. This one is not as sweet. It is a little bit more tart. It also has a bit of a stronger flavor. So, I do like it but sweet potato stills gets the vote from me. And now the one that you've never tried before. In fact, neither of us has tried it before. This one is pumpkin. All about the pumpkin. And yeah, we just saw it at a supermarket so we figured why not. So it is similar in color to the one that is made with sweet potato. Similar consistency. Mmmmm. Wow. This one is the sweetest of the three. Seriously. I wouldn't expect that from pumpkin. Like you can't even tell it is pumpkin. So has it dethroned the sweet potato. Maybe. I mean the sweet potato is an old favorite. It can't really be dethroned that quickly. Um, but yeah, that is really really good. Really tasty. So it is time to try your three. Here they are. Yeah, it was a kind of hard to wait while you were gobbling your three down but you know I somehow managed. I'm still here. I haven't wasted away just yet. Okay, so yeah I'll do it in the same order. So, sweet potato first. Yeah. Eating with his hands. Forget cutlery. Who needs it. Who needs it. Yeah, you're right the saltiness of the cheese really compliments the sweet of the potato. Yeah. And for those who haven't tried this type of sweets here in Argentina. They're a bit gelatin like. Like they have obviously the taste of the flavor. Like the sweet potato or the pumpkin or the quince jam. But the consistency of it is kind of in gelatin form. Yeah, okay. Alright, so next up this is the membrillo. And before I bite into this I have to say this one is my favorite out of these two. I love. Well anyways, I'll take a bite. I'm going to explain. Mmmmm. Mmmmm. He says. That is just so tart. And it just has just enough sugar that it is not overwhelming but it is kind of the borderline. And number three, on to the mystery one. The one that neither of us has tried before. I kind of wonder if it is a new product or if maybe we've only just come across it. Yeah, that is sweeter. Yeah. I don't think it is a strong of a flavor as the other two though. Yeah, it is hard to tell it is pumpkin. So, if I had to rank them I would go quince jam membrillo and then I would do sweet potato and then a close third is the pumpkin one. So, yeah, they're all good. If you're in Argentina you definitely have to try them. Yeah, and this is like the cheapest dessert you can get. It is considered the trucker's dessert. Something you get at a truck-stop. It seriously is. And to mention about the cheese it sort of reminds me something sort of in between a mozzarella and a cream cheese. But it is a little bit closer to the mozzarella on the spectrum. You can imagine it is closer to a mozzarella but it has a bit of a cream cheese consistency too. So not that you've polished everything off your plate tell us about the price. So you can basically pick these up at any store really. Any kind of convenience store, any kind of grocery store. You're going to find the dulce, the basically the sweet of the fruit, you're going to find these on the shelf. And we got ours for like 18 Pesos which is just like a dollar twenty five US. A dollar thirty US. And the cheese, and like going back to that, those are huge boxes. Like 500 grams worth. That is half a kilo. Half a kilo. And you're going to get a big brick of the cheese, a big block of the cheese and it is probably going to set you back anywhere between let's say 60 to 70 Pesos. So under five dollars. More like about 4.25. So it is the kind of meal that if you're with a group of friends all four or five of you can have dessert with just one pack of the fruit and one pack of the cheese. #eatArgentina So this afternoon we are doing an Argentine snacks taste test. So at the very end of our stay in Buenos Aires Sam and I hit up a convenience store and we tried to pick up candies, chocolate bars, cookies and just typical snacks that you can pickup for just a few dollars. So we actually meant to film that video while we were still in Argentina but unfortunately I completely lost my voice. I couldn't even speak. So we had to pack all of those snacks into our suitcase and bring them over to Peru. So they got a little bit smooshed but they should still taste the same. So today we're going to be filming that video. Sampling some Argentine snacks. Okay, so first up I'm trying something called Tita. And it would appear this is a sweet cookie with a lemon flavor. Maybe chocolate over top. Let's find out. Oh man. Open that Tita up. Okay. So this is what it looks like. You do get some chocolate there. Let's bite in. Mmmmm. So it is two cookies layered together. It almost has like a lemon flavored icing in the middle. And then chocolate all over the exterior of it. You like it? It is pretty nice. I do like it. This would be nice with a cup of tea. Smack! So the first one that I'm trying is called Smack. And I have no idea what this is. The cool thing about this taste test is the only things that I've actually tried are the alfajores. So all of this is completely new for me. So opening this up. It has like it feels light in the hand. I'm guessing it is probably a wafer. A chocolate wafer. Well, actually a wafer that has been covered in chocolate. So let's try that. This is what it looks like. Mmmmm. Yeah, let's have a look inside. That is exactly what it is. The layers. Mmmmm. Wow. That's good. Normally when you have a wafer or a bar it is about, I don't know, I'd say about a quarter or half as thick as this. So this is really thick. So you get a nice big amount in your mouth. And I think this might be like a chocolate mouse on the outside. It is quite decadent and rich. I'm going to have another bite. Okay so this one here is called Rhodesia. And let's see. Very colorful packaging. It sounds like wafer cookies. Also lemon flavored. Oh. I wonder if it will be similar to Tita. You're going to be able to compare and contrast. Yeah. Well, first thing I'm noticing is the size. This is much larger than the Tita. It is also covered in chocolate. But yeah, it is a different type of cookie. This is going to be a wafer. Mmmmm. It is very crumbly inside your mouth. It also has a, I wouldn't call it an icing, it is almost like a thick cream that tastes a bit like lemon. It is good. So let's give this a shot. Hahaha. He's funny. He's so funny. So this is a Shot chocolate bar. And I can tell you that it is a chocolate bar. It just has that feel in the hand. It feels like a thick chocolate bar. Wow. Really thick. And you can see that there is some kind of a nut inside of it. So let's try that. Wow. Those are peanuts. Mmmmmm. Let's have a look inside the chocolate bar. Oh, it is so yummy. It is so nice to have a chocolate bar that is filled with tonnes of nuts. Really really tasty. Yeah, and you're a fan of snickers. That has lots of peanuts so those should keep you happy. It is. So now this one is one that I'm very familiar with. I used to love Bon O Bon when I was a kid. It was my favorite candy. So let's open it. So you ate that growing up in the mountainside by Cordoba. So there we go. That is what it looks like. Ooh, it is like a round little ball. Round little chocolate ball. Bite into it. And look at that. You've got like this buttery peanut filling. And that is surrounded by a little wafer. That looks so good. And then a layer of chocolate all around. Oh, that looks good. Mmmmm. I can see why you liked it. So you got to try a Bon O Bon so it is only fair that I get to try one too right. So they come in a number of different flavors. Um, because this is white I'm assuming. Maybe it is white chocolate. So let's open that up. So you can see that it this is the shape. Oh, wow. Let's have a look inside. Wow. I'm guessing that is kind of like a nut filling mouse. That is really really sweet. Wow. I'm really starting to feel a sugar high now. So next up we've got something called Bonafide Rama. Rama means branch and this almost looks like it is going to resemble a tree trunk or even a tree branch. So let's dig in. I'm expecting white chocolate. Oh, wow. So it comes in a little container. Look at this. Are those little individuals. And like you get a whole bunch of them. Woah. Fancy. I've never had this. Fancy. So let's see. Mmmmm. Wow. It is like almost like chocolate shavings. It is like these layers of chocolate that have been shaped into little tree branches. It is kind of an unusual shape. It is kind of cool. And yeah, white chocolate. It is good. Alright next one is Mantecol I believe. And I have no idea what this is. I really don't. This one feels a lot heavier in the hand then the last one so I'm guessing it is a bit thicker. Oh, okay. So this one sort of didn't survive the plane ride. It cracked. It didn't melt. It cracked though. It is actually the perfect bite. Mmmmm. Oh, wow. I would have to guess that is peanut. Oh, it is. You really notice it after you've been chewing it for a while. So it is like a peanut. It is not like a chocolate bar. It is thick but it there is no chocolate over top of it. Like fudge. Peanut fudge. It is a bit more like fudge but it is not quite as dense as a fudge so this is like in its own category but itself. It is pretty good. I like it instantly because I'm a big fan of anything with peanuts. In Canada I eat a lot of peanut butter so. Mmmm. This is good. Alright, so this one is called Dos Corazones. That means two hearts. It says chocolate con poesia. Chocolate with poetry. Oooh. Wow. That is the romantic one huh? Little chocolate bite with a milk filling. Let's see. I'm almost expecting a poem in here. Seriously. Maybe there is. Oh my gosh. What? No way. It does have a poem. It does have a poem. Read it. It says: Un poema de amor tengo para voz guardado una caricia, un beso y este corazon apasionado. So it says a poem of love I have for you, a caress, a kiss in this passionate heart. That doesn't really rhyme when you try and translate everything. Wow. It came with a poem. So that is the go to chocolate if you're on a date or something? Yeah. And look, let me show you this. It is going to start melting in my fingers. Oh, look at the little love hearts. Oh. Love hearts. Mmmmmm. It has like a creamy filling inside. Maybe like nugget or something? So next up I'm trying something that I think is called Vauquita. So vauquita would mean little cows so that is some kind of variation for the product. So this appears to be like some kind of tablet. Maybe something like fudge. And it is made with dulce de leche. Well, not maybe it has to be for sure because that is what it says on the package. So let's see if we can get a closer look at that. Mmmmmm. It almost looks like a brownie on camera. It is so sweet. You can taste the dulce de leche but it is almost a little bit, a little bit sour. More so than. Yeah. Yeah. It is really good. It is really decadent. This one is a bit more like fudge. Wow. Yeah, I like it. So this one is called Bocadito Chipi. Totally new for me. Again, no idea what this is. It is tiny. It is a little square chocolate. Oh, look at that. Oh, is it white and dark. Yeah, so you've got a layer of white chocolate on top, milk chocolate on the bottom and it looks like it may have little bits of peanuts. Peanuts maybe? Or torrone? Maybe turrone. What is this? Does it say? Peanuts. Toasted peanuts. Mmmmm. That is kind of nice. If you can't decide between milk chocolate or white chocolate this one gives you both. Alright so next up we have mentitas and these are little chocolate peppermint patties. And I'm going to be honest with you I've had a few of these since I've been here. When I went to this little bakery called La Pasta Frola to get our alfajores, our artesanal alfajores I saw these little mints. And I thought oh I've got to get a few of these. And he's been addicted ever since. These are awesome. So let's try it here. Mmmmm. Wow. So, if you've ever had After Eight or York Peppermint patties or Junior Mints then you know what these taste like. These are just your classic chocolate mint and it is very refreshing and very minty. And very chocolate-y. So I love it. So this one here is Bocadito Bonafide and it is a wafer cookie filled with dulce de leche. Covered in chocolate. Let's see. Wow. I'm starting to get full this. This is too much chocolate. Oh man. It is already gooey in the package. That one didn't fair as well did it? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Okay, this is messy. Oh wow is that like a jam? No, it is filled with dulce de leche but it is kind of liquid-y. So it has dripped all over my face and all over my hands. It is good. It is just messy. Don't look at me. So now it is time for me to try my Alfajor and this is my favorite dessert slash snack in Argentina. We've been eating Alfajores like there is no tomorrow. But mostly from Havanna and from another place so this is a brand I haven't tried yet. But I am excited about it. And when it comes out it kind of looks like, if you're from Canada or the US, it kind of looks like a wagon wheel. It has that same type of shape. And this one surprisingly didn't get too smushed in the airplane. There is another one that totally got crushed which we're not even going to put in this video because it would look awful. But we are going to try this one here. Mmmmm. Oh wow. Let's have a look inside. Yeah, look at all of the dulce de leche. Oh. And that is a crumbly cookie. Yes, this is really really tasty. Wow. You know what, this might be my last alfajor for months if not years because we are now gone from Argentina and I'm going to savor this one. And last but not least we're doing one more alfajor This one is the Terrabus brand. And it says three layers of cake. It says torta so I have a feeling this should be a softer alfajor instead of cookies I'm expecting like more moist layers. This is going to be a big one. That does look big. Oh, I think it is the biggest one yet. I'm full. Woah! Man. Gigantic! There we have it. A triple one. And look if you take a closer look you can actually see the dulce de leche in there. Do you see that? Yeah, you can. Look at that. Man, oh man. Seriously decadent. Alright, let's do this. Mmmmm. That is all chocolate. Chocolate filling, with dulce de leche layers in between, and then it is all bathed in chocolate again. So much chocolate. Oh my gosh. And you're so full. I'm done. It is good but I'm done. That was enough snacks guys. Out! So that concludes our Argentine food taste test. We are stuffed, we're on a sugar high. So now it is over to you. Have you tried any foods from Argentina before? Any kinds of snacks, chocolates. Anything like that? So if you're looking to pick any of these up they're really cheap. I think everything single one of these costs less than a dollar so you can load up on these if you're in Buenos Aires or another city in Argentina. And please do let us know if you're tried them before or if any of them look good or which ones you'd like to try yourself. And remember to eat in moderation. Yes, because we need a siesta now. Don't do what we did. So for today's lunch we are eating at El Palacio de la Papa Frita. That is the French Fry Palace. And actually here they specialize in potatoes. Fried potatoes. And they have so many different varieties. So what we've done is order a basket, as a bit of a sampler, showcasing the best of the best. And I think that is coming. The potatoes have arrived. Yes, do you want to tell us how found this place? Yeah, um, one of the great things about our YouTube channel is the community we have around it. We so appreciate everyone who watches our videos and even more so for people who leave comments. And they give helpful tips of restaurants and place to go to. So this was a recommendation from a recent comment and we realized hey this is not too far from our place. We were kind of craving. Let's check it out. Let's eat some potatoes. We're kind of craving potatoes so here we are. So enough yackity yack yack. Let's actually try these. Okay, so the most famous potato that they have here is called papa souffle. And as you can see it is like blown-up like a little bubble. And they're kind of secretive about how these are made. I've heard a few different theories. Some people say it is because they soak the potatoes in cold water and then fry them. Other people have told me that they use really high heat when they're cooking them and that results in like a little bubble potato. Um, so yeah, I don't actually know the truth. So if you know the truth leave us a little comment. Um, but actually I remember trying these potatoes when I first moved to Argentina. When I was six years old. And I love these. I just thought it was the coolest thing ever. Bubble potatoes, so it is nice to be having them again. And yeah, it is just air inside but you want to be careful when you bite into it because like there is so much steam that comes out. I don't know if you can see that but it is still steaming. Okay, and the one have right there is called Rejilla which means fence. It can mean a few different things but let's go with fence. Yes, it does look like a fence. Criss-crossed. Yeah, it is criss-crossed. Nice texture there. Yeah, it looks like a crinkle chip here. So, let's try it. It is really crunchy. Yeah. Wow. Is it almost like a chip? Yeah, it is almost more like a potato chip than it is a french fry. Yeah, than it is a french fry. I like it. Nice and salty. Okay, so this is a more familiar potato. This one is called Papa Baston. Which means like a stick or a cane. And it just looks like a regular french fry. Maybe a little bit thicker. So yeah, that tastes like a regular potato or regular french fry. Mmm, so yeah good. Not as exciting as the souffle but not bad. Alright, and the last one for me to try here is the Noisette. It just looks like a tiny little ball. A little marble. A little marble. There you go. Mmmmm. That's good. That, I mean it is almost a bit like a like a mashed potato really. Because you have the, you just have the coating and you're mostly tasting the inside of the potato. I think it is supposed to be French style. Noisette. Cute little petite Noisette. So that concludes the four main types of potato you can get at this restaurant. They have a few others. They have mashed potato and things like that but that is not so exciting. Yeah, um, and we got it with a side because we didn't want to be having just potatoes. Yeah, so what is this? This here is the Chorizo. That is basically a gigantic sausage. Look at how big that is. And I'm really enjoying this. I took a bite of mine so far and like that is is very lean meat. It doesn't have chunks of fat and sometimes you get Chorizo with these nasty chewy balls. Wow, they really know how to do their sausages here in Argentina. They just put the sausages from like Canada or the US in shame. North American hotdogs. It puts them to shame. And you're eating it the proper Argentine way with Chimichurri. You can't have meat without Chimichurri. And this is made with garlic and a few different mystery spices. I don't even know exactly. And olive oil base I believe. But it is so good. It gives it a bit of extra flavor. Mmmm. It is nice and garlic-y. You're going to want to keep your distance after this. Feeling satisfied after all of those potatoes? Oh man, once again we were defeated by this meal. We couldn't quite finish it. The portion was that huge. We ate about half. Gigantic. Okay, let's talk about price point then. So in total that meal came to 200 Pesos. So the chorizo sausage were 50 each and the fries were 90. So actually, so sorry that is 190 then. Yeah, not bad. So really good value. I mean that is like $13 US dollars and we were stuffed. The two of us couldn't even finish that. So, I can't recommend this place more highly. Like this was an awesome suggestion from a YouTube viewer and definitely if you have a chance to come here do it. Eat some potatoes. Come get stuffed and then go for a nice long walk afterwards.",False,20170410 - ULTIMATE Argentina Food Tour ≡ƒçª≡ƒç╖ ∩╜£ Iconic Street Foods & Best Restaurants in Buenos Aires & Beyond.en.srt

Today we're on a bit of a food mission. We've been hearing about Din Tai Fung (鼎泰豐 - 鼎泰丰). Apparently, they specialize in soup dumplings. So that is what we're going to try today. We absolutely love dumplings so any excuse for us to eat dumplings is always a good one and yeah it is another rainy day in Taipei (臺北市) so we figured let's plan our day around food. Let's go eat. Yes, and this place opens at ten in the morning and we are expecting huge lines. So we're here early let's go get in line. So we got here just as the place was opening at ten in the morning and we already have probably about fifty people in front of us standing in line. The good thing is they are handing out a menu to everyone who is waiting so you can have an idea of what you want to order and then your food will be ready sooner. So we are currently placing our order. Of course we're going for the classic Xiaolongbao (小笼包 - 小籠包). Gotta get those. What else? We're still deciding what else. Still deciding what else. It is a big menu. It is a huge menu. Look at that. So many choices. The location we're at has four floors and right now we're heading up to the third one. I'm guessing the other ones are full already. Well, we made it. We're out of the rain and we got a table. It wasn't that long of a wait. No, like five minutes. So. No, I would say a bit more. Okay maybe ten. Fifteen. Ten or fifteen but haha. Maybe I was just so excited to be here that time is just going so fast. Time sped up. So our tea is already here. They gave us free Oolong tea (烏龍茶 - 乌龙茶). You do get free Oolong tea (烏龍茶 - 乌龙茶) and we've finally. Oh and you also get slices of ginger as well too. Yeah, that is where the dumplings. That is for the dumplings and we finally decided on our menu. So we're getting ah if you look down here we're getting pork xiao long bao (小笼包 - 小籠包) which is we're getting the ten pieces. Oh. And we're also getting for dessert we're getting a taro xiaolongbao (芋泥小包) and we're only getting five of those. So that should be sweet inside and then we also have a noodle dish. Noodles with spicy sesame and peanut sauce (擔擔麵). So really looking forward to that. And is there one else oh yeah. Sticky rice in a wrap with pork. So that is probably going to be like a lotus leaf wrap. So yeah we're just at this point waiting for everything to arrive and oh are we ever hungry. We basically skipped breakfast for this. Alright so before coming here we were reading the history of the place and apparently the man who started this Yang he used to run a shop where he sold cooking oil and like that was his business but apparently when that industry started to change and people weren't buying as much cooking oil anymore he had to come up with a new business idea so he and his wife decided okay we're going to sell soup dumplings and like they became such a huge hit that today they have locations not only across Taipei (臺北市) and Taiwan (中華民國) but also around the world in places like LA, Hong Kong. So yeah, pretty cool story and now we're waiting for the food. This is the look of excitement. So the star of the meal has arrived. The Xiaolongbao (小笼包 - 小籠包) is here on the table in real life. And this is cool. So you eat it with a special sauce and they actually give you instructions on how it is done. So here in the restaurant they actually give you a guide how to enjoy Xiao long bao (小笼包 - 小籠包). This is how you eat it. Um, and they basically explain how to prepare the sauce so we're going to try our hand at this. The waiter actually wanted to make it for us and we're like no. We are filming this. Haha. So allow me to demonstrate. Okay so first up we have our little plate with ginger right here. So it says put some soy sauce and vinegar. So it is one part soy sauce. One part soy sauce. And three parts vinegar. I'd say that is about the right vinegar. Next up we grab our little Xiaolongbao (小笼包 - 小籠包) and dip it into the sauce. Once it has been dipped we place it on the spoon. Let us see what is next. Oh, let's not forget you have to poke a little hole to let out the soupy broth that is hiding in there. Can you see that. Oh my gosh. Oh wow look at it seeping out. Pouring out. And then then you take some of the ginger from the plate add it on top and it all goes in in one bite. Is that too big for one bite? Try. Mmmm. Is that tasty? Wow. That is amazing. That is so juicy. Oh man. Is that one of the best dumplings you've ever had? It really is. I'm so glad we came here and stood in line. This is worth it. Okay Sam, let's see if you were paying attention to the instructions. There is a lot going on so okay first up we're going to grab it. I'm going to try not to break the soupiness of it. Dip it in here. Put it in the spoon. Grab a piece of ginger. No no no. What do you do first to the dumpling? Oh, I've got to break it open. Release the juices. Gotta pierce it. Oh, there we go. It is coming out. There you go. There we go. Oh my. Alright. Now I'll grab a piece of ginger. Just like that. And all in at once. Oh yeah. Hahaha. Mmmm. Isn't that amazing? Wow. It is just like. There is two things that come to mind right away and the first being the quality of the soup inside. So the second thing is the skin of the dumpling. It is just so thin and it such a wonderful it is almost I wouldnt' call it a buttery taste but it just has a nice texture in your mouth. Yeah. Oh, this is so good. I was reading apparently the chefs who have been training at this they can roll out twenty dumpling skins per minute. Which is insane. That is insane. Insanity. That is like one every three seconds. Right? Yeah, I know three seconds per dumpling. Wow. That is crazy. Wow. Okay so we have ordered other dishes but before we move on can we just admire this dumpling a little bit longer. Can you see the soupiness in there. Is that in focus? Yeah, you can tell. Look at that. And the dumpling on top you've probably noticed it has the perfect swirl. Apparently, the chefs have to pinch it eighteen times to get that beautiful shape. So I mean like the amount of detail that goes into this is crazy. And it is so tasty. So I'm just going to keep eating them. Let's go for another. Release the soup. Oh la lah. More ginger. Let's put lots of ginger in there. I'm not afraid of ginger. Haha. And in it goes again. Mmmm. Wonderful isn't it? Alright, so the Xiaolongbao (小笼包 - 小籠包) is amazing but we did order more food so we have to move on. We did. So we've moving on to noodles that are in a peanut and a spicy sauce (擔擔麵). So yeah. Yeah, peanut and sesame. Yeah, it has got sesame. That look so good. So I'm just going to give it a real good mix here. Yeah, just basically trying to soak up all of the noodles in the sauce. Alright. I love peanut sauce. Me too. So I'm super excited. I'm really excited for this one I have to admit. Okay. Mmmm. Look at you go. Oh man. Sam doesn't waste any time. Wow. You, oh it is spicy. It is one of those things where you can tell it is spicy as soon you have it but then as you're swallowing it is like woah. Oh my. So yeah, really nice and spicy. You really taste the peanut and you also really taste the sesame sauce too. And it is just so good. It is kind of sweet. It is a combination of being sweet and spicy and I just love that and the texture of the noodles they are quite dense noodles. So really like that. Big hit instantly. Okay so now I'm going to try the noodles and one of the waitresses just came over and told us apparently we have to stir it more because there is still lots of sauce left at the bottom. So let's obey. Let's give it a real good mix Audrey. Let's make sure we're doing this the right way. That we're getting all that saucey goodness. I think that looks good. I can't wait for you to try this I think you're going to really like it. Let's see. And the one thing that we've now been in Taipei (臺北市) for this is what our third or fourth day. And my gosh is this ever a city for foodies. Like if you're into food this is the place where you've gotta come. That is amazing. It is like so nutty. Nutty and sweet and spicy. It is an amazing combination of flavors. I like this a lot. And we weren't even going to order this. Sam was like eh I don't know this sounds kind of plain but this is the star. Okay, time to move on to the third dish. Yeah, so we've got sticky rice wrapped with pork (糯米雞 - 糯米鸡). So what I'm going to do is just try to dissect that to see. Oh, look at that. You can see the pork right there. Oh my. Oh, look at those colors. Turn it back around. Show us that baby. It is so sticky. There we go. Look at that. Look at those colors. So I'm going to go in for the pork and obviously the sticky rice (糯米雞 - 糯米鸡). That pork looks so juicy. Oh, my gosh. It might be like along with what the Xiao Long Bao (小笼包 - 小籠包) I actually like that even more than the noodles and that is saying a lot because I love the noodles. It is just that pork is so juicy and so fatty. It has just got so much flavor to it and then the sticky rice really enhances it. Oh, loving it. This is just like an awesome meal man. This is so good. So I've already been sampling the rice and that is pretty good. If you take a look at the plate I think what makes it so special is that is has a little bit of fat that adds juiciness but like it is not chewy fat that you wouldn't want. It is just like that fat that just melts in your mouth and adds flavor. Yeah. Exactly. And just look at the color of that meat. It is just so amazing. Mmmm. So yeah I'm going in for bite number two while you're holding the camera. Quality control. Look at that. Look at the pork. Look at those colors. It is like a golden brown. I know. And literally it just melts in your mouth. We finished every last morsel of our mains so now we're moving on to dessert. Yeah, so we're trying Taro Xiaolongbao (小笼包 - 小籠包). Yeah. Going back to the Xiao Long Bao (小笼包 - 小籠包). Okay, that is the star of this restaurant. I can't wait to try this. I bet it is going to be amazing. Mmmm. Oh yeah. Wow. The taro is just so sweet and then it is just so rich and creamy inside of my mouth and so piping hot and warm. Yeah, it was still steaming when they brought it. It makes the perfect dessert. Okay, so my turn to try it. I actually had my eye on the chocolate dumplings but those cost a lot more so we figured let's try taro instead. So yeah, this is made with taro root. I've never tried that before. So I'm going to take a half bite so I can show you what it looks like inside. Mmmm. Mmmm. It is like purple. Wow. That is like manioc. Like sweetened manioc. Do you like it? Mmmm. What do you think? It was not what I was expecting but it is not bad. Lasting impressions of Din Tai Fung (鼎泰豐 - 鼎泰丰). Oh, this place was fantastic. Not only was the food really good but the service was very attentive. So in terms of the price point looking here it is five hundred and twenty eight Taiwan dollars which is sixteen dollars and fifty cents US. So you're looking at roughly eight dollars per person and that was for four different things and unlimited tea. And it includes the service charge. Yeah. So I mean that. How can you get better value than that? I mean we're leaving full. We're leaving satisfied and it also didn't cost a fortune either so highly recommend this place. I know for a fact we'll be back again before leave Taipei (臺北市). So somebody got a little souvenir to remember their meal here. So I like the quality of the chopsticks so much here that I got a set for us. So we each get our own set and this will be for our future house. Haha. Alright, so it has been a few hours since we last ate and tonight we're going out for Taiwanese street food (台灣街頭食品). So we're heading to the Shilin Night Market (士林夜市) and we're going to take the MRT to get there. Let's go eat. Sam may be feeling a little bit hangry right now. Just a little bit hangry. Let's ask to be sure. Hey Sam? What? How hangry are you on a level from one to ten? I think I've burst through ten. I'm eleven. So to get to the Shilin Night Market (士林夜市) you want to take the red line to Jiantan Station (劍潭站) and then take exit 1. So we have just arrived at the Shilin Night Market (士林夜市) and it is still quite early. It is 4:30 PM. Most of the stalls start opening closer to five o'clock and things will only continue to get busier as the night goes on. And apparently this market can run until like one or two in the morning. So yeah, still very early. We were hungry so we couldn't wait any longer. So we are having some kind of Barbecue roll with green onion (黑胡椒豬肉卷) in it. Okay so we are having our first snack of the night. And if you have a look over here it is basically a pork roll and it is filled with green onions and she also asked us if we wanted it spicy so she put some powder over it. Of course we said yes. Yes. Haha. Always. So look at that. Oh that looks good. Mmmm. Oh man. Do you like that? That is really nice. Yeah. I'm so hungry right now. What does it taste like because I've never had anything like this before? Well, have a look at it here. It is filled with green onions. That is like the main ingredient in the middle. So you taste both the pork and the green onions. Okay, so Sam's going in. Time for me to try it. Mmmm. That is really good. I like that the green onions give it like a bit of juiciness. Yeah. Yeah. And the pork is a little bit salty but it is not too as spicy as I thought it would be. Yeah. And we paid the equivalent of five dollars for this. It was a bit expensive. A little bit pricy but I mean. It was 150 Taiwanese Dollars. So yeah. But it is good. So there is one drink I've been wanting to try ever since we got to Taipei (臺北市). I love bubble tea (珍珠奶茶) and apparently it originated here so voila. Look at that. Look at that. I got one with brown sugar so you can see me mixing it. You can see the brown sugar. So good. On the sides and then you can see the like the pearl tapioca jellies at the bottom. Man, that looks good. Oh man. Oh man. Mmmmm. Real deal? That is so amazing. I love this drink so so much. Is it nice and sweet? Mmmm. What can you taste? Don't want to choke on the tapioca balls but it is almost syrupy. The brown sugar. Like it is quite thick. So you really get that flavor coming through and I love that it is made with milk because apparently you can just get straight up tea and I was like no no no let's go with the classic. Give me some milk here. The milk in there. So yeah, it is so good. So good. So Sam just had to get a taste of it as well. Of course. I'm sharing. Sharing is caring. So how much was this one? Mmmm. Okay, before I talk about that I just have to say how good and sweet that is. Yeah. You really taste the brown sugar. Oh man. And then you get sucking up all of the jellies. Man, that is good. Okay so that was 50 Taiwan dollars which is about a dollar fifty US. So yeah that is a nice affordable cheap drink. And so worth it. So worth it. And you know what else is cool. They give you a really thick straw so you can get at your bubbles. Yep. Exactly. Suck them bubbles. So for our next Taiwanese street snack we are having Taiwan fried chicken (鹹酥雞) and this was quite the process. Like first he took the chicken breaded it, deep-fried it and then he took a pan and added the sauce. We got sweet chili and then pan-fried the chicken even further in the glaze. And are those rice cakes beside it? These look like these could be little rice cakes. Yeah. Oh wow. And then on top of that he sprinkled peanuts and sesame seeds. It looks amazing. Yeah. And that was one hundred and ten Taiwanese dollars so you're looking at about three US bucks for that. A little bit more. A little more than three US. How is that? Mmmm. Oh my gosh. Good? It is so tender but so juicy at the same time. How about the sauce? Sweet. So sweet. Which is really good. So this was Sam's pick tonight. And I think you're going to be very pleased. I think I will. Oh that is so good. Isn't it? Like you said really tender. Yeah. And I love the combination of nuts and sesame seeds on the outside. Yeah. It gives it a crunch. Yeah. Mmmm. Perfect combination. And it is a bit spicy too. So if I can offer one piece of advice when visiting this market it would be to come a little bit later in the evening. We arrived around four thirty and it was you know pretty quiet. Things are starting to pickup a little bit but our food options have been a little bit limited because people are just you know showing up and opening their stalls. So later in the evening is best. Thank you. So Sam is leading the way with this one. What are we having next? Alright moment of truth. We've been playing it kind of tame. Playing it kind of safe so far. We're going right in to the classic Taiwanese street food (台湾街头食品) here. We are having Stinky Tofu (臭豆腐). Oh my. And it is funny because we saw this tofu stand and we're like is this stinky or not we don't know. So I walk up to it and I go. Sniff. Oh yeah. That is the real deal. That is stinky. That is definitely the real stuff. So if you've never tried this before I was reading on wikipedia earlier this afternoon that it smells something like stinky feet or garbage. Rotting garbage. Oh my. So yeah it is strong. I'm going to go take a bite here. Yeah. I think there is some cabbage. You can see it is on a double skewer here. Yeah, a double skewers and it has got cabbage in the middle. Somewhat like a sandwich. Oh my. A little overpowering there. That is something else. Oh. It is spicy. Um. Oh man. I'm keeping my distance. It is just you really taste the sourness of it. And the fermented aspect and woah. That is something that would take a while to get used to. I don't think I'm ever going to enjoy this one to be honest. How about a second bite to. Alright I'll do one more. I'll do one more. Maybe it'll grow on you. I also kind of want you to eat most of it so I will have very little left for myself. So just go ahead. Oh. Go ahead. That is something. I don't even know how to describe it because I've never had anything quite like it before. So. Wow. That is fascinating. How much did it cost? That was only forty five. So just over a dollar. About a dollar thirty or a dollar forty for that. So it is cheap. And you should try it if you're in Taipei (臺北市). Why not right? Yep. And did I mention that scooters come zipping around out of nowhere. Okay. So after stinky tofu (臭豆腐) comes the reward. Although that being said I don't deserve a reward because I didn't try the tofu. But we decided to get something sweet instead. This is for you Sam. I'm going to sample it for you to make sure it is okay. So we got a crepe (蛋餅) with oreo ice cream, Nutella, banana, whipped cream, chocolate powder. Yeah, it was the whole process of making it was pretty fancy. Mmmm. How is that? Mmmm. Sweet tooth cravings fulfilled? Haha. You're speechless. That is how I know it is good. For your bravery. You are being awarded an ice cream. This is my reward here. Which I've sampled for you. Hey don't make out with the ice cream. Mmmm. I'm still going to have some more. Oh I'm going to be making out with the ice cream some more. Hey! Sam! That is so mean. It is all over your lips too. That is so good. So decadent. I mean I just got on the second bite a lot of Nutella and like woah. With the ice cream and whipped cream and then the light fluffiness of the crepe. Man, I haven't even. Oh yeah it is a good dessert. I haven't had Nutella yet. That is a nice Taiwanese dessert here. So we've already had dessert but we thought 'hey' there is always room for one more. Dessert just keeps rolling. And this is definitely the most colorful thing we've seen out here at the Shilin Night Market (士林夜市) so far. So apparently if you can see here. These are pieces of strawberry that have been put on a skewer and these are candied (糖葫蘆) or called a toffee kind of fruit. Yeah. And you also notice sweet tomatoes and also plums as well. Yeah. We decided to go with strawberry. Yeah. So let's try that here. I'm going to try eating a whole one. Oh my. Oh wow. It is like properly hard on the outside. Mmmm. Okay. Oh wow. Mmmm. That is like a super quenching. That is like a super crunchy sweet glaze on the outside. Mmmm. And the fruit extra juicy on the inside. Is it warm fruit? It is. You can tell it has been like warmed up. Cooked up a little bit. Yeah. It kind of tastes like if you've ever had strawberry shortcake the way the strawberries are kind of a little bit warm like that. Oh yeah. Being placed next to a cake. Look at that color. It is so good. Ruby red. We forgot to take a picture. Mmmm. And you know what? A tomato snuck into the mix. Look. Are you serious? Strawberry, strawberry, tomato. Where is the tomato? The little one. Oh wow. Ah. You've gotta bite hard. Yep. Yep. Oh, look. It is seeping all over the place. Hahaha. Whoopsies. Oh my gosh. So what do you think? I'm making a mess on someone's storefront. Do you like it? Yeah, it is good. But we better run off now. So that is a wrap from Shilin Night Market (士林夜市). We really enjoyed eating all of the different Taiwanese street food (臺灣菜) and we're going to be eating up at a lot more night markets here in Taipei (臺北市) so stay tuned for that. Alright guys. We are up before the sun today and it is for a really good reason. We've been hearing about Taiwanese breakfast at this one particular spot and we're going to go check it out. The MRT just opened and now it is time to go. Yes, apparently this restaurant opens at five thirty in the morning but the MRT didn't start running until 6 am so we had to wait. Now we can finally venture out. Exit five. How excited are you for breakfast? Well now that I've actually finally woken up I'm quite excited. Ready to chow down. Chow down. Let's go. So apparently we're not the only ones. So we found the restaurant. It is called Fu Hang Dou Jiang (阜杭豆漿). Hopefully I am pronouncing that right. And we had to wait in line about twenty to thirty minutes and that was at six thirty in the morning so I can't imagine what it is like when you come later in the morning. But anyways we ordered. Now ordering was a bit tricky because their menu is not in English so I had to do some research in advance and kind of show up with the names written out. But now I'm going to show you what we ordered and tell you what it is called in case you want to try the same things. Alright, let's check it out. And of course we have two bowls of soy milk because that is what they specialize in and that is called Dou Jiang (豆漿). One is hot and one is cold. One is like piping hot. This one is like boiling so we're going to be sampling those. Let's have a look. So yeah, it is just soy milk. I've never drank milk with a spoon but that is a first. So we asked for both of our soy milks to be sweetened so that is good. Because who doesn't love sugar. And I'm trying the cold one now. So let's see. I don't think I've ever had soy milk before. Are you serious? Never. Never? Why am I blowing on the milk? It is already cold. My gosh. Haha. Mmmm. Wow. It does taste like tofu. Does it? Soy milk tastes like tofu. Yeah. But it is sweet. And refreshing. That is weird. Does it have like a bit of dessert like taste almost? Like sweet tofu. Yeah, first time trying this. It is not bad. I think this could grow on me the more I have it. Okay so we're going to break into the mystery roll. Yeah, so take a look down here. I'm just going to snap it in half. It feels dense I know there is definitely something inside. Oh, woah. Oh it is super syrupy. Okay. Woah. Maybe that wasn't the best idea. Haha. Look can you see the syrup? Yeah. Look at all of that. I'm going to guess that is pineapple. But who knows. Mmmmm. Is it sweet? It is very sweet. You know what? It tastes like a sesame. Sweetened sesame sauce. Not like a soy base sesame sauce but like pure sesame. Mmmm. That is like so good. So sweet. And everything we're trying so far has been really sweet. So I kind of like that we're getting a big of a sugar high this morning. Okay. That looks like a sweet pastry. You can really taste the sesame seeds on the outside too. I didn't mention that but. I'm sure you'll be able to tell. Mmmm. You know what I mean about the sesame paste? Doesn't that taste like sesame to you? And honey maybe? Yeah, it has got like kind of a sesame honey kind of taste in the middle. It is good. It is like a really dense bread. Yeah. And it is kind of flakey but oily at the same time. Do you like it? Yeah. So next up we're having what I believe is the Shao Bing (燒餅 - 烧饼) so it looks like a sandwich but it is basically a wheat cake and it is stuffed with egg. An omelette, chives. Yeah, it looks like a sandwich. Yeah. Omelette sandwich. And it is really sticky on top so I think it has like some kind of sweet glaze. But let's find out for sure. You know what? I'm starting to realize that in Taiwan there is a major sweet tooth. A lot of the food is sweet and I'm enjoying that. Is it? I'm really enjoying this. Yeah. Is it also savory too? Yeah, it is like a fried omelette so that is greasy and salty but then you've got the sweetness of the bread so it is a nice combination. Mmmm. Alright, my turn to try. Mmmmm. Oh wow. Mmmm. You know what this reminds me of? Like whenever I go back home and this is only about once a year my Dad will cook up a big omelet and we'll have some healthy bread that has been toasted and usually I put like a bit of jam on the bread and then I put the omelet on top of the toast and eat it. That is a weird combination but I've seen him do it. And it kind of reminds me of this. Like the sweetness of the bread and then the nice omelette. It is just like a nice contrast in combination. This last one is either Yutiah or Youtiao (油條 - 油条) please let me know in the comments. We're butchering these names I'm sure pretty fiercely. Um, at first glance it kind of reminds me of a bit of a porras that we had in Spain. Like those giant sized kind of churros like things. Yeah. And I have to say it is like super light in the hand. It looks a lot bigger than what it is. It is really flimsy and light. So I'm going to give that a try. So it is like a deep-fried dough stick and all we need right now is that thick Spanish hot chocolate and we're set. Oh. Okay. It tastes like a bit greasy and salty as opposed to being sweet. And yeah it kind of a nice contrast to all of the sweet dishes we've been having this morning. This one is a little saltier. Yeah. I'm going to try another bite. And you know what? When they served it up to us they actually put it in the sandwich. Yeah. So I think you can probably put both of them together. And it has got a like a kind of flaky buttery taste as well to it. It is greasy on the outside and I quite like it. Yeah. So let's reassemble that sandwich. Have another bite why don't you? Okay. So now I've got like a monster sandwich. Let's try that. Mmmmm. It adds a bit of crunchiness to it. Yeah? And a little more salt and greasiness. Mmmm. Okay. Yeah, it doesn't have a whole lot of flavor on its own I have to say. It just tastes greasy. Yeah. And it is like really flaky and like light. It kind of reminds me of a croissant a little bit but it is not something I would want to eat on its own. I can see why she would put it in the sandwich. But even better that cup of hot chocolate. Haha. That muddy Spanish hot chocolate. As if we're not getting enough sweets as it is. Maybe you can dip it in the soy milk. Do you think that is how it is done? Why don't you try it? I'll do it in yours. Yours is warm. Watch everyone is going to be shaking their heads. Nooo. That is way better. That is way better? See. That is how I would recommend having that. I have no idea of just how you're supposed to do it but that is how we're rolling. Yep. You're going in for another bite. That is how we roll. Maybe we're creating something new in Taiwan. I highly doubt it but. Well that line is now wrapping around the building. We had to wait twenty to thirty minutes. It is at least two to three times as long now. That is probably going to take like forty five to an hour. Sure glad we came when we did. Yeah. Come early! So are you feeling ready to take on Taipei after that breakfast? Yeah, I've got my sugar high. I've got you know like my saltiness with the egg. So I'm ready to go. And in terms of price point that was a hundred and thirty five Taiwanese dollars so it worked out to just over two US dollars per person. So really cheap, really tasty food. And yeah, I can see why there is a big line. And the one thing I wish we could have tried was something I think called Dan Bing (蛋餅) which is basically a pancake with the omelet stuffed inside. We noticed some other people having that and we're like ooh that looked good. And I also saw people having some kind of porridge that I just didn't know the name of it. Yeah, anyways we ate enough. I mean we're full now but yeah there is other things to try though. Yeah, so if you want to find this place straight out of exit five and here you've got the market. You just go down this way up to the second floor and you'll see the lines. Yeah, and don't forget to come early. Yeah. Greetings from Taipei, Taiwan. Another day and another night market. And we brought our appetite. Today we are visiting the Raohe Night Market (饒河夜市) and they are renown for their street food. If you want to have street food this is the one market you need to visit. And earlier this week we visited Shilin market (士林夜市) where we got to try a few different treats. Yeah. But we're on the lookout for more Taiwanese street food (Xiaochi - 小吃). It is all about the food tonight. Let's go eat. Okay so we found our first snack of the night. Before we even entered the market. Yeah, so we're trying a pork bun (胡椒餅) that was cooked in the oven. And this is just freshly made so really exciting. It is like pipping hot. I can feel it warm in my hands. And it was cooked in what resembled like one of those Indian tandoori ovens where the bread just sticks to the side. That is really good. And this is filled with pork and chives. So I'm not getting a lot of pork on the first bite but it is very thick and condensed. So very doughy. Let's see if we can get a better look. Alright, so we've finally made it to the point where I can get some meat here. Alright. Mmmm. Bite number two. Oh yeah. Nice big piece of pork. A big piece of pork. What? Is it ground pork? It is ground pork. It is ground pork. Mmmm. The pork is a little bit sweet and also a little bit spicy. But the dough is savory and salty. It is a nice contrast. It tastes really good. And it was also really cheap. It was only fifty Taiwan dollars which is I think about a dollar fifty. A little bit more than a dollar fifty US. So Sam got the giant pork bun but they also have options for vegetarians in the form of mini-buns. So I'm going to try that one. Look at it. Yeah. Covered in sesame seeds. That was just stuffed at the bottom of our package. So pretty cool. There you go. It is just the chives. That is all that is in it. That is your vegetable. The chives. The green onions. Is it tasty? Really tasty. And I like that it is a small bite. And I like that is was a bonus. We didn't pay for it. Or I feel like we didn't pay for it. It was just like stuffed in the bottom of the bag. We like free things. What is next? Okay, next we're having something sweet so we stopped at Anna's egg tart (蛋撻). And these are like the miniature egg tarts (蛋撻) that you might find in Portugal or Hong Kong or Macau. Except these are like mini bites that you can just pop them right in. Yeah, you can pop them in. One each. Mmmm. How is that? That is really nice. It is like creamy and smooth and custardy. It is really good. I'll have this one too. Hey! Hahaha. That is so mean. I'm not sure this is going to be enough for Sam the giant. Show us that tiny little. Look at how small that is. These are really mini. When they said they were mini they weren't kidding. But I love these. Like you've said I've had them in Portugal, I've had them in Hong Kong. I've had them in Macau so really cool to try egg tarts here in Taiwan. Yeah. Big enough to fill a cavity, right Sam? Mmmm. Oh man. What do you think? That is really good. The thing I really like about it is that it is really creamy and sweet. I can tell that those are freshly made because it is still warm. Yeah. Mmmm. And they were so cheap. Flaky pastry. How much did we pay? They were only twenty each. So you're talking like just over a dollar US for us to both have. Maybe like a dollar twenty. Really really good. Nice little bite. But yeah that is not going to fill me up. Alright, let's keep moving. Red bean. Okay. (Speaking Chinese) And now it is time for a mystery sample that caught our eye but we have no idea what it is. We're being a little adventurous here. We have no idea what this is. It is cold in the hand. And it feels kind of slimy. And we got ten of these for thirty five Taiwan dollars so that is just over one US dollar. So let's just hop right in and try it. Um, I think I heard him say red bean. Yes, one of these are red bean. And this was sitting on ice. It looks like a dessert that was sitting on ice. Mmmm. Okay. Sweet. Yeah. The red beans obviously has some sugar added to it. And if I had to guess I think it is something the consistency is sort of like a rice cake on the outside. Do you think it is like a miniature mochi ball (麻糍 - 麻糬), maybe? It could be. It might be little mochi balls (麻糍 - 麻糬). Quality control. Quality control. Mmmm. Is it passing quality control? It is. I like it. It is kind of like a I would consider it to be a little bit more like a dessert than. It is definitely not savory. It is sweet. Good stuff. My hand is actually freezing holding this bag because it has chunks of ice in it. Um, but I'm going to try a different one. Sam was having the red bean. And this is another mystery one. It is yellow. I have no idea. The lady was trying to explain what it was but I don't get it. We didn't catch. We didn't catch it. Does it taste like anything familiar? No? It has like the texture of bean paste. Yeah. White bean paste? Is there such a thing as a white bean? Hahaha. I don't know. It is good though. It reminds me a lot of red bean paste just different color. But it is sweet. And it is cold. My hands are so cold right now. So this next snack was purchased solely for its cute factor. Let's take a look in the the bag. They're like these little egg waffles (雞蛋仔) or pancakes shaped like a cartoon. So here I've got Sponge Bob Square Pants. Let's see who else is in there. We've got this is like a Pokemon. That is a Pokemon. I don't really follow it. I have no idea. If you guys follow Pokemon tell us who it is. And if it a Pokemon. Hahaha. This looks like a cow with giant nostrils. No, that is panda bear. That is a panda bear. Anyways let's try it and see what it is like. A cow with giant nostrils. Nice. Oh how is that? Okay. So no filling whatsoever. But it is super light and fluffy and it has like pockets of air inside. Is it sweet? It is pretty nice. This would be good with ice cream. Oh, it is sweet. Oh yeah. It is like cake. Fluffy cake. Okay Sam, who will you be devouring tonight? So I'm going to bite in to Sponge Bob here. Sponge Bob. Square Pants. Those are really good. They're freshly made. That is what I'm loving about this night market so far. Everything we've had has been pipping hot. Freshly made. Gotta love that. And it was cheap too. So we paid forty five Taiwan dollars for this one. Which is less than one dollar and fifty cents US. So and we got five. We got five of them. Yeah. We'll be snacking on these for a while. Alright. Please put the whole cookie deep in your mouth and chew it. So what are you having Audrey? It is smoking. Smoking cookie. I have to put this whole thing in my mouth, chew with my teeth and not with my tongue. Alright. Woah! It is smoking out of your mouth. Haha. You look like a dragon. Haha. Is it good? It is cold. It is ice. Oh wow. It kind of gets stuck to your tongue. That is why they tell you to eat it with your teeth and eat it fast. Because it wants to get stuck to your tongue. So you probably just saw me try a smoking cookie. We also got some ice cream from the same place. This is called Smoking Molecule ice cream. I got the bubble tea (波霸奶茶) flavor and this is the bubble tea sauce in a syringe. An injection of it. An injection. Let me inject that. He said do it slowly. There we go. That looks good. And it has the pearls. This is bubble tea (波霸奶茶) which I love. Let's see is this going to make me smoke as well? Like this ice cream is super cold. It was so cold it was freezing. I don't know what they're putting into it. Let's try. Mmmm. How is that? Ha! It is not making me smoke. No smoke this time. No smoke this time but the ice cream is really good. It is dripping down the sides but it is tasty. Mmmmm. Yeah. That place was a lot of fun. It is kind of like a performance while they're making your food. Yeah, that is what I thought too. I thought it was just fascinating to see how it was made and just it is such a charismatic performance and a lot of attention to detail. A lot of fun. It is called Cooler Bear (酷樂熊). Yeah. Definitely check this one out. Yes. One of our coolest things yet. The sugar high continues. Yeah, we've had a really imbalanced ah ratio of sugary things versus savory things so I think after this we're going to have to hit up some savory stuff for sure. Yeah. Alright. Let's try that. And it is also starting to rain here at the market. Mmmm. So you can probably notice a few droplets on the camera. Oh that has got a nice really rich flavor. It almost it does taste like bubble tea (波霸奶茶) but it also tastes a bit like a coffee flavor to me as well. Yeah. Yeah. I noticed that too. Did you notice that too? Yeah. Mmmm. Love that. Love that stuff. Even the spoons are cute. They're shaped like little hearts. Yeah. This is one my favorites so far. Time to bring out the big guns. Yeah, so this is the one we've been trying to hunt down for a long time. This is fried chicken steak (大雞排) and it is so popular that there is like a order list. So we're just waiting for our number. We're 253 and the current order I think is 250 so we've got three more to wait for. Alright. Big meal for the big boy. What are you having next Sam? This is the chicken steak (大雞排) and this thing is a behemoth. Like look how big this is. And look how thick it is. I think it is fresh out of the fryer. It is pipping hot. Like it is actually too hot on my hands. I have to put the plastic bag around it. Yeah. Anyways, without further adieu let's try this. Oh and we got the chili version of it too. Yeah, the spicy one. Don't burn yourself on the wait. Woah. You can see the steam coming off. Oh my gosh that is good. Oh my gosh that is good. How was that chicken steak (大雞排)? Pure magic? Pure magic. It is so crispy on the outside. It tastes like the crunch and then you also taste the spiciness - the chili. But then the chicken is so thick and juicy on the inside. It is like that contrast between crunchiness and juiciness. And it is so good. I love this. I love this. Mmmm. So I don't know if you can see this right now but seriously check out the chicken. It is such a thick juicy cut. I know. You can just oh. There is so much more generous than what I thought. It is massive. You're going to like this. Oh. Hot? Mmmm. That is so good. The spicy coating on the exterior has got this crunch. It is almost like you're having chips. Like crisps. I know. It is so so good. And that is my favorite savory dish of the night so far. How about you? Yeah this is one of the best things we've had tonight. And the price was really reasonable. Sixty five Taiwanese dollars. So two dollars. Yeah. Two US bucks for that bad boy. This giant piece of meat. Like seriously that is really good value. Imagine going to a restaurant and getting this much meat. This much chicken. Amazing. It costs a lot more. Value for sure. So that is a wrap from the market for us. We're going to call it a night and head back. It has started pouring rain and it is basically just masses of people like bumping into each other with their umbrellas. So we're like okay probably time to call it quits. But we have lots of snacks that we're taking back with us. And oh gosh just as we were leaving we made the most horrible mistake. I wanted to order bubble tea (波霸奶茶) with milk and I got the original without milk so it is just black tea with tapioca balls. But I think there is brown sugar too. So it should be sweet. Yeah. But it is not what I wanted so I'm so disappointed. But anyways that was fun. We ate really well so I would definitely say this is a market worth checking out if you're in Taipei (臺北市). And yeah that was good. So if you want to check out this really cool night market in Taipei, Taiwan you're going to come to Songshan station (松山車站) and then you're going to take exit one and it basically takes you right there. You just walk for like a couple of minutes and you'll see the market right away. Yeah, and you turn left. There is a huge temple at the entrance. Yeah. So I mean you can't miss it seriously. Well good morning good morning. Today is our last day in Taipei (臺北市) so we're going out for a dish that we've been saving for last. We're going to be trying beef noodle soup (牛肉麵 - 牛肉面) and this is a super popular dish. We plotted a whole bunch of places on our phone and finally settled on one. So let's go find Jian Hong Beef Noodles (建宏牛肉麵). Alright, so the food is already here. It came out super quickly. We ordered two bowls and this is a small portion but you know what? I think this is going to be pretty filling for one person. Yeah. I was kind of worried we wouldn't be able to get a table because it is already eleven thirty in the morning. So kind of close to lunch but there is still plenty of space so that is good. Um, but yeah, anyways let's have a look. A closer look at the meal. So here you have it. So it is a noodle soup with a beef broth and these chunks of meat on top. Those are really generous chunks of meat. I know. Yeah, it is a lot thicker than I would have imagined. Yeah. And the beef it can be tendon, brisket or shank. And again I was worried this was going to be all tendon. I'm not a huge fan of tendon so I'm glad to see like some really nice cuts of meat in here with not a whole lot of fat. So yeah, I'm going to grab some chopsticks right here. Lots of what appears to be chives. Green onions as well. Yeah, chives on top. So let's do this. Let's try noodles first. I love my noodles. Putting my noodles on a spoon perhaps. Mmm. That is good. They look thick. Mmmm. They are quite thick yeah. They are nice. A little chewy. They've been soaking in the beef broth so that is nice. Let's go for some noodles and meat now. Oh my. This is messy. I do not have a talent for noodles and chopsticks. My goodness. Haha. Why don't you try the meat? Both of them. Noodles and meat. Okay. So you're getting the noodles on there. Got the noodles. Ooh, okay. You know what? Let's just go with the meat guys. The chopsticks aren't helping me today. Mmmm. Oh wow. It is like really salty and savory. Mmm. You like that? Mmmm. It is quite tender as well. Yeah, this has been cooking for a while. This is good. Pleasantly surprised over here. Alright, time for me to try it so before I try the noodles or the meat I'm just going to go in for a bit of soup. Alright, I want to see what the broth tastes like. So I've got a nice big thing of broth. Mmmm. That is really nice. It is not overpowering. It has just got kind of like a nice beefy broth taste. Yeah. It is not spicy. It is a little bit savory but yeah not sweet either. Yeah. But just really nice. It is just kind of a light broth that I think will compliment the noodles and the meat which I haven't tried yet. Yeah, I would say the meat has a stronger flavor than the broth. Because you think. I'm going to go for the meat then next. Mmmm. Your right it does have a stronger flavor. Yeah. And this piece has a bit of fat. A little bit of fat on it too. Oh no. It gives it. I mean it is tender but it is also chewy. It is very chewy. Wait, was it fat or tendon then? It was just fat. Okay. A little extra flavoring. Let's try the noodles. Mmmm. Those are also good too. I like thickly cut noodles so it is tasty. And just yeah overall it is a nice soup. You've got a light broth, you've got your meat and then you've got your thick noodles. So it is perfect to warm you up on a fall day like right now. Maybe a little less animalistic. So I'm actually a little bit curious about this. There is like a huge bucket of sauce. It looks more like a paste. An orange paste. I can not identify this. It looks like in terms of texture it almost looks like polenta but I mean obviously it is not. Does it have a strong smell? It does not have a strong smell. So let's just get it in there and see what happens. Let's have some noodles with sauce. This one has me totally stumped. Although now I'm starting to feel it burn in the back of my tongue. Oh my. So spicy obviously? It is definitely hot. I have no idea what other ingredients are here or what gives it that consistency or texture. But it is definitely spicy. Oh man. It kicks in at the very end. So I'm putting a pretty good dent in my soup I would say. Already half way done. Although, Sam has been helping to be honest. Look at mine. I'm just working on the broth. He's been stealing some of my meat and noodles. I have been. But anyway just to give you an idea of how popular beef noodle soup (牛肉麵 - 牛肉面) is every year they have a festival here in Taipei (臺北市) and chef's get together and they kind of compete to create the best recipe but also give it a bit of a twist and make it a little different. Um, and apparently one year there were rumors circulating that the festival wasn't going to happen and everyone was so upset and they were like protesting so the mayor was like it is okay guys. He had to reassure them. The festival will go on. So I mean if people think they are not getting their beef noodle soup (牛肉麵 - 牛肉面) it is a pretty big deal. I guess this means somebody enjoyed their meal. Yeah, the bowl is empty. Satisfied over here. And in terms of price point it came to a hundred and ten Taiwan dollars. So you're looking at just under $3.50 US. So yeah, good value. It is a cheap meal that you can have and it is something you can get anywhere in Taipei (臺北市). Just walk around and you'll find one of these shops and just go in and place an order. That's what we did. Well good evening, good evening. Tonight the street food adventures continue and we are going to be eating at the Ningxia Night Market (寧夏夜市). So this is our third night market here in Taipei (臺北市) and I feel like there is still a lot of Taiwanese street food we haven't tried. So we're going to be on a mission to try a whole bunch of new stuff tonight. Let's check it out. And we've already found our first snack of the night. Tell us. Yeah, so if you look down here we are having a breaded cheese and shrimp stick apparently. Oh la lah. And there is a lot of Taiwanese seafood snacks that we haven't tried yet so we're just diving right in to that tonight on our third and final street food video here. Alright, so it is fresh out of the deep-fryer. And I must say that holding it in the hand I mean it looks really skinny and maybe a little flimsy but it is actually fairly substantial. Like there is a bit of weight to it in my hands. So I'm really excited to try this. Oh and they put some honey mustard on the outside. Yeah, they had a few different sauces. Like mayo and stuff. So we decided to go with that. Let's just try it. Oh, wow. Look at that cheese. Cheesy. Mmmm. That tastes quite a bit better than I thought it was going to. Um, really crunchy on the outside and then of course you get the gooey cheese. You can see it just like coming straight from the stick to my mouth. Alright, so time for me to try this. I didn't get any cheese. Have another bite. Oh you got lots of cheese on that one. Woah! Look at that. Gooey gooey cheese. My goodness. It is mozzarella. Yeah. So what do you think? It is good. It just tastes like breaded shrimp but I mean it is nothing fancy. This could be like frozen shrimp out of the freezer and into the deep fryer. Whatever. But yeah, it is a nice little snack. I'm hungry so I'm not complaining. So I'm really excited for this snack. I've tried it before and it has a few different names. I've heard it be called a Chinese style pizza (蔥油餅 - 葱油饼). Yeah, or green onion pancake (蔥油餅 - 葱油饼). Yeah, so and really it is neither a pancake nor a pizza. Um, it is kind of dark here so it is probably a little bit hard to see but I'll open this. I would compare it more to a roti. It is like this fluffy um flatbread. And look at that. You can see the green onions in it. Yeah, it has green onions and you can also get it with different fillings. You can get it with an omelet. Yeah, or you can get it with melted cheese. Yeah, we tried one with melted cheese a couple of days ago. When we were out on a little day trip and it was good. Oh man. How is that? This one has both. Oh really? Yeah. Oh, wow. This is really good. Lucky us. And it is really salty. Really greasy. Probably not the best for you but it tastes oh so good. So it is my turn. Let's give it a try. Woah. Let's not make out with it now. I bit in to the egg and the cheese part like right where the biggest amount was. So it kind of like urgh. Sprayed me in the lip. But that is really good. Mmmmm. I really like this and this is the kind of food that I could eat any time of day. I could have it for breakfast, lunch, dinner or as a snack. Yeah. And it is really cheap. We paid 35 Taiwan dollars. 35 so basically one US dollar. Just slightly more than a US dollar. So really good value and really cheap and we're enjoying this right here on the street. Alright, time to give it back. Give it back. So watching this next snack be prepared was quite the spectacle and a little bit scary. Ha, so if you look down here you can basically see that it is cubed meat (火焰骰子牛). And it was cooked by what I like to call the flame-thrower. Hahaha. Yeah. So he's like grilling it but at the same time he's using the torch to cook it faster. Yeah, exactly. And we've seen this at the other two night markets so this is something I've wanted to try and we're finally getting a chance to do it. So yeah, this is awesome. So I'm just going to take my little stick here. My massive toothpick and try it. Mmmm. That is really good. Yeah. Super juicy. I wouldn't call it tender. It is a bit of a fatty meat. Yeah. But lots of flavor. Don't choke on it. Pepper. The ground pepper is getting stuck in my throat. Oh man. But yeah it is really good. Really good. I'm losing my voice. Hahaha. Oh man, you sound like the Godfather. Okay, so time to try this. The meat was a little bit fatty so I'm like trying to be meticulous. Let's see which piece will be the best. Mmmmm. You like that? It is very juicy but like you mentioned it also a bit chewy. So yeah, it is not the softest meat (火焰骰子牛) but it is very flavorful. And I like that we chose a simple dressing. We just put black pepper and some sea salt so nothing fancy. Yeah because you can get something like teriyaki and other things. Oh and how much was that? This was a hundred Taiwanese dollars so just a little bit over three dollars. And this was a small portion. You can get bigger ones as well. So initial thoughts from this market it is a lot smaller from the two markets we visited earlier this week. Shilin (士林夜市) and Raohe (饒河夜市)) and this one is strictly food. It is probably just the length of one block pedestrian only and yeah it is just little stands selling food, no clothes, shoes or anything like that. If you want kids toys there is like a second block that continues behind us but there is no food there. So we're just sticking with street food for now. And when I say pedestrian only I mean that bicycles and motorcycles still get through somehow. I'm not sure why. Ni Hao. Papaya milk. Small or large? Small please. Okay, sixty. Sixty. Yep. Ah yes. Thank you. Thank you. Xie xie. Xie xie. So we've had a lot of savory treats so far so getting a little thirsty. So we noticed a place selling papaya milk so we're going to give that a try here. Papaya milk. I've never heard of that before. Oh. That is really good. Yeah? Really creamy. Is it milky or more fruity? Uh, it is about half and half. To be honest. You really taste the papaya. You really taste the milkiness of it. Um, I like that it is sweet but it doesn't seem like that added a lot of sugar or any at all. You taste the natural fruit flavor and the milk. It is not overwhelming amounts of sugar like say in a milkshake so I like that. It tastes more natural. One more. I like that. Alright, so packaging is pretty cute. We've got two little panda bears on top and they also had a lot of different flavors. They had like apple milk, avocado milk and like a whole bunch of other fruits so we went for papaya. This was Sam's decision. I'm not the biggest fan of papaya so we'll see. See if you actually like it or not? It is frothy. Yeah. It is almost like a milkshake. It is but it is not as sweet as a milk shake. Would you agree? Okay, that is not bad. I mean I still don't love papaya. You would have got a different flavor. I would have. Which one would you have got? If they had strawberry I would have had strawberry. But yeah, I like that it is very creamy and thick and frothy. That is one good thing about the drink. A different fruit would have made it better. This one was my pick. I saw they had baked potatoes. And I ordered the double cheese potato (王子起司馬鈴薯). So she put what looks kind of like a cheese whiz. Like a melted cheddar. Yeah, and then on top parmesan. And it looks like that might be oregano or some kind of spice. There is a lot of cheese going on. Yeah. And this is like steaming. It is pipping hot. Piping hot. Mmmm. Is it good? Yeah. Very cheesy. Very cheesy. It is nice. And you can also get it with other toppings. They had like ham and corn and whole bunch of other things to choose from. We went for the double cheese. We really like our cheese. Mmmmm. I really like this angle here because we've got a bearded red haired man right behind you. Check it out. Are you serious? Check the sign. Haha. My bearding abilities are not that good but I can eat well. I can eat well. So let's try this. *Cough sounds* We're both choking on the potato. I'm choking on the parmesan. Oh. Cough. Alright, we're good. We've both recovered. Mmmm. What do you think? That is really cheesy. Yeah. I mean it is not the best quality cheese (王子起司馬鈴薯) but it does the job. It does the job and I mean for the price point was it sixty Taiwan dollars. So less than two bucks and it makes a good snack on the street. So we are now ready to move on to dessert and we are having something called Coffin bread (府城棺材板) and I've been told this is a dessert that originated in Southern Taiwan in a particular city. Can't remember the name now. Um but it is called Coffin bread (府城棺材板) because the toast is carved into a little coffin and then it is filled. Look at that. And you can choose all sorts of fillings. We chose the tapioca pearls. Yeah because and brown sugar because we just can't get enough of that stuff. Haha. So yeah the toast was deep-fried and then afterwards they carved it. The preparation was fascinating. Yeah. Alright, let's give it a try. It is nice thick toast too. It is thick. But you know what? It is smaller than what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be like those giant square pieces of toast that are like super thick. So let's see. So what say you? It tastes like deep-fried dough. Hahaha. Do you taste the tapioca pearls and the brown sugar? Not quite the strong to be honest. It is mostly like the taste of the oil and deep-fried bread coming through. So. Not my favorite to be honest. It looks really cool on camera but flavor-wise it is not my favorite. Maybe with a different filling. I'm going to let you try it now. Let's see what you think. First impressions? What do your taste buds think? I feel kind of the same way you do. Yeah. I think it could use a little more of a stronger topping. Yeah but maybe more brown sugar. But the Coffin bread (府城棺材板) itself is good I would just like to see a different topping with a bit more sugar added. More sugar. That would also go good with ice cream too. Yeah, maybe icing sugar on top or like more brown sugar inside the coffin. Yeah because the tapioca, the pearls, it is just a little bit bland inside. Yeah, I do agree with you about that. Yeah, alright. Well, most of the food has been a hit so far tonight but sometimes you just can't win them all. So final thoughts from this market. We ate pretty well but in comparison to the other two we visited previously. Shilin (士林夜市) and Raohe (饒河夜市)) I would say this one has a little bit less variety to choose because it is smaller so I prefer the other two. What about you? But I feel like this one is a little bit more traditional so I quite like that. I think I like it a little bit more than you but it is the kind of place where you just come for the food and the experience and it is very busy so I think it was fun. I'd come back again but yeah if you go to the other two night markets which are bigger and a little more famous you do have more food options definitely. Alright, Mister give us instructions. How do we get there? So to get to this Taipei Night Market you're going to take the red line. You're going to get off at Shuanglian (雙連站). Take exit one, take a left. You're going to walk down about two or three blocks and you're going to see it on your left hand side. You can't miss it. Alright guys, we are currently at Dongmen station (東門) here in Taipei (臺北市) and everytime we come here we are tempted by these amazing desserts that they have advertised all over the walls. I'm going to show you what it looks like and then I'm going to tell you all about it. So they clearly do not skimp out on advertising. Like that entire station is plastered in ads for this dessert. And apparently this is called Mango Iced Snowflake (Baobing - 刨冰 - 礤冰). And they have two shops right outside the station so let's go eat. Let's go do it. And like most places worth eating at here in Taipei (臺北市) there is a huge line but we're going to go stand there anyway. Alright, so our dessert has arrived. And it is standing room only at this particular spot. So they've got like this little bar outside where you just bring your dessert, you eat it here but check this out. Yeah, because all of the tables are full. I know it is packed with people and there is a huge line of people ordering. So this is it. This is the Mango Snowflake Ice (Xue hua bin - 雪花冰). It is a mountain. Like this is huge. And we went for the classic so it is just mango and panna cotta on top. But I mean they probably have like ten different flavors with like strawberries and chocolate and red beans and you can choose anything really. This is also called Ice Monster in some places as well. Okay, yeah so there is two chains. There is Ice Monster (芒果冰) and Smoothie House (思慕昔本館). We're at Smoothie House (思慕昔本館) right now so let's just dig right in. Dig right in. That is amazing. Guys we're sharing this. Like apparently at this serving size is enough for two to four people. Yeah, Sam was like we should each get our own. Horrible idea. That would have been awful. That would have ruined dinner. Mmmmm. Brain freeze. Brain freeze. Did you take too big of a bite? That is amazing. The Mangoes are so sweet and ripe. Yep. Mmmm. What else are you tasting though? Oh man. It has got the mango has kind of this glaze almost. Do you taste like ice? Ice and the panna cotta? Oh yeah. You've got your ice. Your ice mountain. Mango flavored. But seriously, the fresh mango that is like my favorite part so far. It has got like this syrupy sugar that is amazing. And I love panna cotta. I love ordering this dessert whenever we're traveling in Italy. It is just so creamy and milky. So yeah, I'm really really pleased with this dessert. Mmmm. Alright, so Sam finally gets to dig in. You've had about five bites and I've had none. So someone has to film and somebody has to eat. I've got a bit of catching up to do here. Okay, so I'm just going to try and get a bit of everything. Oh wow. The ice is melting a bit already. I know you have to be fast with this because it just starts melting on the spot. Okay, I'm going to get some mango. So I've got a little bit of everything now. Mmmm. What do you think? Oh yeah, that is really sweet. You taste. You really taste the shaved ice, you really taste the syrup and the nice big chunks or mango. Fresh mango. It reminds me of something we had in Korea not too long ago called Sulbing (설빙). Yeah, which is their shaved ice dessert (Bao Bing - 刨冰 - 礤冰)) and yeah it is really good. Um, I think I would enjoy this even more on a hot day as opposed to a cool one like this but it is still a lot of fun and still really enjoying it. Okay, so how would you rate your first mango ice snowflake experience? That was really good. Really filling. We needed the two of us to finish that off. We probably could have used a third spoon in there. Yeah, I kept getting brain freezes like every second bite. That stuff was so cold. I know it was really cold. Eating cold shaved ice on a cold day. Probably not the best strategy in life but anyways yeah it was two hundred and ten Taiwan dollars which is under just under seven US dollars. So I mean if you divide it by two people it is like three dollars and fifty cents. Not bad. Not bad value. It is not the cheapest dessert but I think it is really good. It is really filling. It is one of the top 40 things you've got to eat in Taipei (臺北市) according to CNN. Well there you go. So yeah, it is worth trying and yeah let us know what you think when you give it a shot.",False,"20170410 - Ultimate Taipei Food Tour ≡ƒç╣≡ƒç╝ ∩╜£ Best Street Eats, Night Markets & Iconic Taiwanese Dishes.en.srt"

We are in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. And we're hungry it is at night so that means we're going out for street food. And where are we? So today we're checking out Jalan Alor. Or the Alor Street Night Market. Yep. There is so much street food happening right now and they have like these plastic tables set up on the road. And it is just crazy. It is so busy and it smells amazing. It does. Let's go find some food. Small size. Yeah yeah yeah. Okay. Alright, so we are here at the market and Sam has decided to start with something rather unusual. We are having some fruit. We're not messing around. We're having durian and this is like the king of fruits here in Malaysia and other nearby countries like Singapore. In fact, this fruit is so smelly that you often see it banned in certain parts. Yeah on the subway and in hotels. No durians and stuff like that. No durian allowed. But I love this. I absolutely love it. I'm going to open it up. I don't. Oh my gosh it smells so good. So it is really really pungent. Try and describe it for us. Give us smell-o-vision. Mmmm. Smell-o-vision. It is like. It is really sweet and you're making it sound good. It is sweet. It has like I think someone described it once as like eating fruit or something. Eating something like ice cream or creamy out of a toilet bowl. You know that is how I heard it described before. Its smell is potent. I don't mind the smell personally and it just kind of has it almost has like a pudding like texture in your mouth. It is creamy it doesn't taste like a normal fruit that is juicy. But it looks stringy. I haven't got to that part yet. That is good. Oh yum. I'm loving this. I can't wait for you to try it. Hahaha. Um. About that. So quick question for you. Have you actually tried durian before on its own? Not on its own. I think I had it in dessert form and I did not like it. You've got a nice big chunk of it there. Hahaha. It is smooshy. It is smooshy. So just like take a big bite. Oh, how is that smell? That smells rancid. Haha. Okay, time for a bite. Oh my gosh. It smells like fruit that has gone bad? Like garlic. Oh yeah? Garlic-y fruit. Do we have a drink nearby? Do we have a milkshake stand nearby. We have water in my backpack so. Try it. I did. I licked it. You licked it and? And it smells like garlic. Like fruit and garlic combined in to one. I can't say I'm a fan. So not a fan. Yeah, I don't even dare. I get to eat it all. Sam loves it so here you go. Here you go honey all yours. I'm sharing today. That is all you're getting out of me. There we go. Making out with the durian. Oh yeah. Look at that pit. Some on screen romance. Keep going. Mmmmm. Okay no stop. Okay. Sam finished it all. Yeah, I'm almost done. There is a little bit of flesh left on the other ones but I'm almost done. So a durian is not cheap. It is 20 Ringgit which is four dollars and forty cents US for all of this. But if you do want to get a cheaper fruit jackfruit is about a quarter of that price. So you can pick one up really cheaply. Sometimes you can find a little package for under a dollar. Yeah, jackfruit looks similar from the exterior. I don't know about the taste. It is different though. It has got more of a fibrous taste. It doesn't smell quite as strong. Okay. There you go. The love continues. I love durian. Mmmm. Oh yeah. Feed me durian. Feed me durian. We are on the hunt for food. Let's see what we can find next. I'm kind of craving a smoothie. Some kind of fruit juice because it is really hot. I am seeing a lot of Thai food restaurants. Isn't that a little surprising? Yeah, I'm a little surprised by that but Thai food is good. Yeah, I guess they are neighbors. Also I will never understand why cars insist on driving through pedestrian zones. It just doesn't work. Wow, this is awesome. So these are all of the dim sum here. Just one Ringgit each and I get to choose. He gets to choose. Lucky guy. Does it original pork. And this is yam. Chinese potato. Ah, there we go. Okay, so one of Sam's favorite foods is dim sum and it didn't take us very long to find this. And at 1 Ringgit a piece. One Ringgit each. That is literally less than twenty five cents. So we only got three because we want to sample a little bit of everything. Yeah, we want to eat more street food. So this one is made with pork. Yeah. This is made with yam and that is tofu. Yeah, that is tofu. So I'm going to try the pork one. I think that one is called Shui Mei. Yeah. It is huge. Should I do one bite or half of a bite? A two biter. Okay. A two biter. Mmmm. Oh yeah. Wow. Mmmm. That is really good. Yeah. You taste the pork. It is a little bit juicy inside. Yeah. And it is a little oily on the outside. Lots of flavor. Really quite good and these are big dim sum. Yeah. I can't believe how cheap it is. I know. Like seriously. I mean seriously imagine like getting 10 Ringgit worth. Getting like 10 of these and only paying like just over 2 bucks. That is possible here. Mmm. Okay I'm going for the yam. Yams! Alright. Thank you. What do you think? It also has pork. Okay. Yeah. It is like a yam wrapper I guess. It is like colored. Colored with yam but it is a pork filling inside. That is surprising. Tasty? Yeah, it is good. I love the color. I mean that is why we chose it. Because it was purple. So now you're going to try the which one is that? Yeah, this one is tofu right? Yeah, that is the tofu one. Let's see. Good? It kind of reminds me of the texture of that fishcake in Korea. Okay. The Odeng. Yeah. Odeng. Yeah. Yeah. It kind of has that same texture. Oh, that is cool. Very cool. Also something funny we thought we were getting a can of iced tea but this is even better. Thank you. No thanks. But we got this instead. No wonder it was so cheap. I was like what a can for 3 Ringgit? But that looks awesome. It looks like an iced chai tea. Yeah. Look at all of the ice on top too. Very frothy. Let me swallow my dim sum first. I'm still chewing on this. And then you're going to try it huh? Mmmmhmmm. Look at all of that froth. My goodness. Okay, frothy goodness. Mmmm. What do you think? Sweet? Oh man, that is really nice. Is it? It is so sweet. Hahaha. I know the typical teas here in Malaysia are almost like desserts. Yeah, drink desserts. Oh man. If it were any thicker it would be a milkshake. Seriously. That is good stuff huh? And that was only 3 Ringgits so that is what like less than 75 cents. So yeah cheap. Okay, so you've had durian. You've had dim sum. What else are you craving tonight? Oh well, I'm seeing lots of really good cooked meat here on the streets so I'm thinking maybe that might be next for me. So unlike some of the street markets that we've been visiting recently in places like South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand this isn't really a walk and eat market. Like you can do that there is a few stands where you can grab some food quickly and go. But they mostly have little restaurants outside on the street where you just sit down and you grab a meal. So that is what we're doing right now. We're just going to relax, Sam is going to enjoy a beer and we've ordered a few different satays so we're going to show you that. And look at that your beer is here. Okay, and this is a local beer. Skol. Skol. Cheers! Cheers. Time to try that beer. I am very thirsty. Yeah? Yeah. When you're like dehydrated and you're just walking around and you've been eating a lot of salty foods this is perfect. This is perfect. Nice cold beer. So now we can have more salty foods. Yeah. Exactly. The meat has arrived. So check it out. We got four different skewers. We have chicken, beef, pork and lamb. I think it is in that order. But we'll see. And this is the satay. Yeah. It is really good stuff. Let's dip in this. Oh, this looks like it could be peanut. I hope it is peanut. That would be awesome. It is peanut. It is? Oh, that is so cool. Is that tasty? It is so juicy. That is good. Chicken and then next I'm going to do beef. I'm just going to take a bite of everything. And then you can have some. How is that? Yeah, that is fair. As long as you've giving me some bites. Ow! I nearly pierced my own gums. My gosh. Mmmm. That is the beef. It has like a sweet glaze. Oh nice. Really good. This one has to be pork. I think. Wow. That sauce actually looks pretty thick. Yeah. Good stuff? Uh huh. It is so hot. Pork. And last but not least. Last but not least I'm still chewing. Wait. Okay. Lamb. And I have to say these are incredibly cheap. These are only 1.50 Ringgit per piece. So you're talking like maybe 30 cents a piece. Something like that. That is pretty cheap. 30 to 35 cents. Even the lamb is tender. And like usually sometimes you get that tough mutton but this is good. Alright Sam, your turn. My turn. So I am lucky enough that you gave me lots left on each skewer. So I'm just going to like coat mine in the sauce with peanuts. Take it for a swim. Swimming in the peanuts. You're right those are really juicy. I know. Tender. Nice flavor. Nicely grilled. The sauce is awesome. Like. Wow. Alright, moving on to the next one. This one is the beef. Yep. I like that one the best so far. Yeah? Yeah. I think my favorite was the chicken one. The chicken was just so tasty. I agree. That is the pork. The pork was pretty good as well. That might be the juiciest one yet. Yeah? And none of them have fat. I was pretty impressed. They are like nice lean cuts of meat. Alright, and lamb. And last but not least man we ate this really fast. In all fairness they were pretty small but yeah. We don't mess around with our food. Yeah. Coconut. Coconut. Okay. So what toppings do you want Audrey? Oh, I think I'm getting a bit of everything. Definitely the roasted coconut and peanuts and orea and chocolate sprinkles. Do you like some palm sugar? Palm sugar with coconut milk yeah? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Choose your own topping. Okay. Thank you. Oh my goodness. It is all going on. Just load it up. Oh yeah. Look at that. So that is the coconut. What is next? Next peanuts. Peanuts. Oreo. Keep going. Chocolate sprinkles. When you can't decide which one you just get them all right? Get them all. Alright guys so it might be a little bit loud because they are crushing sugarcane right behind us but we're going to enjoy our ice cream right now. We got a coconut ice cream and it has got like the coconut meat or whatever you call it. And also coconut ice cream scoops. The flesh. The flesh. There you go. And it has coconut cream and shredded coconut so it is like four different types of coconut. And they gave us four scoops. 4 scoops of it. And you get unlimited toppings so I kind of went crazy there. You did. I did. Now it is time to try that. No regrets. No regrets. Oh yeah. No regrets? Hahaha. That is so nice. Man and I haven't even gotten to the coconut flesh. I'm just having the ice cream right now. Mmmm. In he goes. Yeah, time to indulge my sweet tooth. I think ice cream just tastes so much better in Southeast Asia because you're just so hot and sweaty. Because you're drenched. It is just so refreshing. I know. It is such a nice way to cool down. I'm loving this. It is a great way to finish off seriously. Yeah. You should try some of the coconut flesh. I didn't get to that. Where is this? Uh, at the very bottom. Oh. It might be tricky. We may have to eat some more ice cream first. Look at that. Oh, I got some of it in there. Yep. Really good. Man, this is just so good. Loving it. Yeah, so this was just under 10 Ringgits. Yeah. So it is just slightly over 2 US dollars. Wow. So that for four scoops of ice cream, lots of toppings, coconut flesh. Yeah. That is a deal. Alright guys, so it is time for a last snack of the night. And we got some mochi. Which are like rice cakes with different fillings. So we chose three different ones. We have strawberry. Sorry these are ice cream mochi right? Yeah! So they are frozen. Yeah. And we got strawberry, cookies and cream and green tea. Cool. So yeah, I've never had frozen mochi before so this is something good. Let's see. Ah. Oh man. This kind of reminds me of the Turkish ice cream that is like really sticky. Oh cool. Yeah, it is good. This is really good. I like the strawberry one. And Sam is going in for the other two flavors. Yeah, so I'm going to try the green tea one. I'm getting full but I've always got room for a little bit of ice cream. Green tea mochi ice cream. What is happening over there? I think I should have taken a smaller bite. A smaller bite? Are you getting a brain freeze over there? Are your teeth feeling it? It is really good though. Hahaha. You can sure taste that green tea. Let's give you a few moments to recover and then we're going in for cookies and cream. Cookies and cream. Alright, finally took care of that. So I'm just going to have a smaller piece of this. That is really good. Yeah, the cookies and cream one is the best one in my opinion. Yeah. Yeah, you really taste the cookies and cream. Hahaha. Oh my gosh. You sound so funny like your tongue is frozen. It is. You sound like the guy in the movie Rat Race who had pierced his tongue and his tongue was swollen and he couldn't speak properly. That is you right now. Now that is an old movie. Alright, so that mochi ice cream was a real hit. That was awesome. That was a great way to end things off. What a nice surprise. So it came to 12 Ringgit which is just like 2 something dollars. So again, cheap. Great way to finish off. Our street food taste test here in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Oh boy boy we are leaving very well fed. I have to say. Oh my gosh. That was a lot more food than I had bargained for but everything was so tasty I just couldn't control myself. Yeah. So that was a lot of fun. Like we've never really filmed street food before in Malaysia. We didn't know this market existed in Kuala Lumpur so it was such a pleasant surprise. Yeah. And the food here is great. You get some really awesome deals. So I'd highly recommend it. Highly recommend it and it has got such a lively vibe. What is also nice is that you can sit down and chill out and just kind of watch everything unfold. Great place to come. Tata! Alright guys, for today's lunch we're at the Central Market here in Kuala Lumpur and we're going to be trying something that is called Peranakan Cuisine or Nyonya Cuisine. And basically this is a combination of Chinese and Malay ingredients and cooking styles and it is the type of food that you'd be able to find in Malacca, Penang, Singapore or parts of Indonesia. It is really tasty. Yeah, and since we're not going to be able to go to Malacca this time around. Awe! We found a place that specializes in Nyonya Cuisine right here. Yes. So happy guys and my mouth is watering. The food came out so quickly and the portions are huge and everything smells delicious. Look at how big the Laksa (叻沙 - 喇沙) is. Look at the size of this bowl. Like look at my little hands. Put your hand over top of it. There is my little hand. It is like bigger than my hand. This could feed like two or three people I think. But it is just mine. Or just us. Just for me. Okay, alright so let me give you a tour. This one is mine. This is the Laksa (叻沙 - 喇沙) and it is a spicy coconut soup. It looks amazing and uh the main ingredients here we've got some chicken, we have shrimp and squid. We have these tofu puffs. We've got a hard boiled egg. Yeah. Lots of veggies. Oh, look at the size of that shrimp. My goodness. That is a big shrimp. Woah! That is a nice and of course the rice noodles. Yeah, rice noodles somewhere. They're at the very bottom. Yeah, and lots of veggies. We have green beans, some bean sprouts. This looks so so good. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Should I be squeezing this in to it? Am I going to burn myself. Let's try. Try that. Squeeze some lime. Lime is always good. Also, this is a good time to show off my art. My Henna art. You just had that done this morning. Yes. At the Batu Caves. Alright. Let's dig right in. Let's start with the noodles. These are thick rice noodles. Those noodles look really good. Oh la lah. Oh man I'm horrible with noodles and chopsticks. I can do them independently but whenever we can find them it is a little disaster there. Mmmm. How is that? Mmmmm. Hahaha. I just love coconut so much. Me too. Coconut and spice. It is really really good. I'm so happy with this. And it is really spicy huh? Yeah. It burns in the throat. It is like slow after burn. You don't feel it right away. Mmmm. And Sam's food looks just as appetizing guys. Yeah. So I'm trying something called Nyonya Chicken Rendang (马来西亚冷当咖喱鸡). Yeah. Let's take a look down here. So you can see that it is chicken that is in a really nice coconut based gravy. Yeah. And it has got a lot of different spices. Chinese and Malay types of spices. Yeah. So what I'm going to do is I just cut off a piece of the chicken here. I'm just going to take that like this with the gravy and pour this on top of the rice. This is a coconut rice with coconut milk. Yeah. And it is blue. Yeah, it has got blue. I love that it is blue. It is so colorful. So grabbing a big piece here of chicken. A little bit of rice. Let's try that. A little bit of everything. Mmmm. That is absolutely amazing. Yeah. The chicken is so tender, the uh gravy is really spicy. You can taste all of those different spices and then of course you get the nice creamy coconut milk. Oh my gosh that is amazing. That is just so good. We've going to love this meal. Okay, I'm going in because this looks so good. Let me just say this is like a prime cut of chicken. Like this is chicken breast with not fat and one thing that I sometimes find a little frustrating is that the way they cook the chicken in Malaysia you get like these weird cuts with like bones and fat. This is not the case with this chicken. This is just nice. Mmmm. Do you like that? Isn't that spicy? It is wonderful. Is there lemongrass in there? I think there might be. Mmmmm. It just tastes like Southeast Asia. Haha. The spices and the coconut. Like one thing I'm loving is the coconut. It just makes everything great. We're huge fans of coconut. Whenever we can try something with coconut we've all over that. Loving this. It is really good. And I'm sharing my Nyonya Laksa (叻沙 - 喇沙). Yes, thank you for that Audrey. So I'm just going to try the base here. The soup first. Yeah. It is almost like a gravy. It is such a thick thick soup. Oooh. Ha! That is just so good. I know! That is just so good. It is just so creamy and just so flavorful and all of the spices. Yeah, like we've been eating a lot of Indian food these last few days because we've really enjoyed but man we've been missing out. We should have been having Nyonya more often. Okay, I'm going to have some of the noodles. Yeah, and as we mentioned earlier you're best bet for Nyonya food probably in Malaysia is going to be Melaka which is only like a couple of hours away. Or also in Penang. Yeah, so when you're going to Malacca you're kind of heading towards the Singapore area so along the Malacca Strait. Mmmm. Oh yeah! Those are nice noodles too. But yeah it is definitely the coconut curry base that makes this so good. Along with all of the spices. Alright and to drink? And to drink we ordered a pot of tea from the Cameron Highlands. That is a really popular region here in Malaysia. The temperatures are cooler there so you can go for a nice visit. This is special for me because many years ago before I met you I went and toured the Cameron Highlands and I went to this very specific tea factory. Oh la lah. So I have been there and it is a highly recommended place to visit if you're traveling in Malaysia. This should be really good quality tea. That is nice. Do you like that? Yeah. I wish I were more of a tea connoisseur so I'd could be like mmmm aromas of earth and grapes and whatever. Kind of like with wine but I don't know that much about tea. I just like drinking tea. Actually I drink so much tea that apparently my teeth are kind of yellow. And the last time I went to the dentist she asked me are you a smoker? And I was so offended. Like no I just like to drink tea. I drink it several times a day. That is what happens. It stains your teeth yellow. But I don't care. So Sam here already took care of the chicken and the coconut rice. And now he has moved on to the Laksa (叻沙 - 喇沙) because I'm full. This is way. There is some foods where we're both getting full and okay we'll just leave it on the table. There is no way I'm leaving this. This is just way too good. It is delicious. This is just way too good. And we still have dessert to come. My gosh! It is just so filling because the soup is more like a gravy. It is so so thick. It fills you up right away. Alright, dessert is here. I feel like I'm about to burst but it looks way too good to leave on the table. So we got the Sago Gula Melaka I believe. Sago to me it looks a lot like tapioca balls. Like miniature tapioca balls. And it is in a coconut cream and they also gave us palm sugar. It has been heated and kind of melted. Yeah, and he suggested we pour it. A little bit. And then try it. And see if you need more. So we're going to do that. Let's try that. It looks like honey it is so thick. Man, the sugar and coconut cream. Because we haven't been getting enough coconut. Oh man. Let's go for it. Mmmmm. Is it good? It is a cold dessert. Okay. I was expecting it to be warm. That is quite nice. You know what? It doesn't even need the sugar. Like the coconut cream itself is so thick and rich. Yeah, it is like you don't even need the sugar. I just want to taste the coconut. Mmmmm. So good. Alright, time for my first bite. So I'm mixing it around. In he goes. Mmmm. Wow. That is some really rich rich coconut milk. My gosh. You know everything we've had today has had coconut in it. Yeah. The soup. The rice. The chicken and now the dessert. And you know what? I would I don't think I'd get tired of this for a very long time. I could probably have this meal day after day. Just rich coconut based dishes. Oh yeah. Yeah, I think we're going to be coming back here even though we've already filmed. Yeah. We're just going to come for pleasure Sam says. Pure fun. That was amaze-balls. We just paid the bill. Tell us about it? Yeah, I don't know if I just forget about the prices or something but I thought it was going to cost a little more. I kind of feel like we almost like I feel like a bit of a thief at this place because that was such a good meal and it cost hardly anything. 45 Ringgit. 45 Ringgit which at present time is 10 US dollars. So two mains, rice, a dessert and a big pot of tea. Yeah, like high quality like high quality tea for ten bucks. So you can't beat that. You know we'll be back again soon. If you're around the Chinatown area go to Central Market. Go to the second level and you'll find this place. It is fantastic. Well good morning from Kuala Lumpur. It is actually a really nice morning. It is not hot out and it is overcast so this is very pleasant. So today this morning we wanted to make a breakfast video but the place we came to is closed for some reason they haven't opened today. So we are looking for a backup that will be equally good where we can show you some of our favorite dishes. So yeah, we're on a bit of a hunt right now and hopefully we'll find something really good soon. Alright, so we finally found a place for breakfast. Woo hoo! Yeah. So we found a place called Restoran Annexe and it is found on Nasi Kandar and yeah it is on the way. We're heading over to KL Bird Park this morning so it is kind of on our way there. And we just saw it and we're like yeah let's go try it out. And they specialize kind of in at least in the morning they specialize in Roti. Roti and prata. Yeah, so we've ordered a whole bunch of those. We've ordered like three and we've got a couple of drinks coming so yeah breakfast is on its way. Alright guys so the drinks are here. Sam went for his classic Teh Tarik and I got myself a Mango juice because you know mangoes are in season and all. So let's see. It looks really frothy on top. It does. Mmmm. That is quite good. How is that? That is really sweet. But you know what? It makes me wonder if it is from concentrate instead of natural mango. I think this is fake. They've given me a fake. Yeah, it is definitely not natural. And you know what? You can probably even tell that from the color because mangos are a bit more yellow. This one is quite orange. And yeah, it is like really sweet. Really sugary. But you know what? It is refreshing. It has got lots of ice so I can't really complain. And there is a nice little juice shop just down the street where they make like fresh squeezed fruit and vegetable juices that are like natural and healthy and just really really tasty. So I think I'm going to pop over there after this. Tea time for Samuel. Yeah, let's try this. I burnt myself just touching your cup earlier. Like that stuff is pipping hot. It really is piping hot. Yeah. And you would think in somewhere like as hot and humid as Kuala Lumpur I wouldn't be having hot tea but early in the morning I still. I still crave my hot teas and coffees. Yeah. So this one is really good. It has got very milky, it is sugary. And it also has like a nice strong tea taste. Oh. Oh, roti cheese. Bombay toast. Oh, thank you. It looks good. Okay so we have to admit the breakfast menu was a little bit limited this morning. When we tried ordering they kept telling us like oh no we don't have that. Oh no we don't have that. Oh sorry we don't have that. So we couldn't order that much stuff to show you. But we did manage to get Bombay Toast and just by looking at it it kind of looks like a French Toast. Except that instead of being served with like syrup or you know Maple Syrup or whatever you're used to you get a dal. Your lentil curry sauce whatever. And something else. So let's take this for a swim. Yeah, it looks pretty good. It looks like it does look fluffy like a piece of French Toast. Yeah, it looks fluffy. It has been soaked in milk and egg. So yeah, this should be interesting. Mmmm. That is good. Do you like it? Okay. Yeah. You know it is a bit strange for me because as a Canadian I associate French Toast with being sweet and sugary. So I wouldn't expect it to be savory. But you know what? The bread is really fluffy. So this is good. It sops up the sauce really well. Mmmm. This one is spicy. This is a spicy sauce. The orange one. So will this be your first time having savory French Toast? Yeah, I think so. I'm pretty sure it is. I can't I'm wracking my brain here and I'm coming up with a blank so. Alright, Bombay Toast. Alright, swish that around. Swish, swish. It goes swish, swish. Mmmmm. You can tell that there is a lot of egg in this toast. So yeah. I really taste the egg. Very omelet-y. And you're right it is kind of like yeah I do associate Maple Syrup being poured all over it. I know! Where is the Canadian Maple Syrup when you need it. But you know what? We're getting used to eating curries for breakfast so yeah. This is how we roll here in Malaysia. Yeah, but you know what? We should pack a bottle of Canadian maple syrup when we travel. Wouldn't that be the best? Yeah, here come the Canucks. It wouldn't last very long. That is true. Maybe like a week. And then we'd be out. Yeah, send us more from home please. So next up we're going for the cheese roti or cheese prata. They use the name interchangeably. Yeah and they've uh they've given us a really big portion here. Yeah, I know. Like it is not just one layer there is like seems to be a bottom layer as well. And you know what? I'm seeing a lot of cheese. Like sometimes when you order this they just put like one measly slice and they're like that is it. Here is your cheese roti. I know. I think they went all out here. Maybe we have two or three. Let's try this. Mmmm. I think that is the best cheese roti I've had. Yeah? And we've been eating this in Singapore and also here in KL. Yeah, like you said there is just a lot of cheese in here. Yeah. They did not skimp. Oozing. They did not skimp out on that. That is what makes it so good. Also, you look like you've have orange lipstick on right now from the food. Haha. Hahaha. Can you see the cheese in there oh la lah. So let's grab this piece. Take it for a swim. Like Sam says. Dunk it in there. I know that is our new expression whenever we dip something in sauce now. That is nice. That is really good. Isn't that good? Like the amount of cheese. The amount of cheese is what makes it. And we've actually just ordered one more to hopefully get a sweet one. They have a Milo roti. So that should be coming soon. Mmmm. Breakfast story time. Yeah, so I have a really cool breakfast story to share with you from the last time we were in Kuala Lumpur maybe about two and a half years ago with my parents. And this was just so awesome. We all went out for breakfast, I think there was a couple of family friends so there must have been like six, seven, eight of us. Yeah, it was a big group. And we ordered a big meal and there was just some friendly locals who struck up a converstation with us and then as we go to pay we realize uh the clerk comes over and goes oh they've taken care of breakfast for us. Yeah. That was so sweet. And it was everyone's first time trying roti and the chai masala. So those nice friendly people we sat next to you know they just quietly paid for our breakfast and it was just such a nice you know gesture. Yeah, a nice gesture especially for my parents because it was there first time in Malaysia. The very first day and to have that kind of hospitality and friendship from locals is just incredible. That is something you never forget. You never forget those kind of moments. Yeah. And that is the breakfast place we wanted to take you to this morning but it was closed. Yeah, so unfortunately it was closed but the memory still lives on. And it is funny because you can visit a lot of sites, you can do a lot of things in a city and over the years you may forget some of that but it is these kind of like these stories and these local interactions you never forget that. Never never. Okay, so we ordered one more Roti because we were still hungry and this one down here has Milo sprinkled on it. So it is not super popular but you can still get it. You can ask for it. And Milo is basically like a chocolate powder that you would mix into your milk kind of like Nesquick. Uh, so yeah this is going to be sweet, it is going to be sugary. It is going to be good. It is a really popular drink here in Malaysia. You know what? We should have ordered the drink as well to kind of compare and contrast. We will do that. We will order the drink. Will we? Yes. Oh man. Okay, we're still eating here. This is like the video that never ends. We just keep ordering more and more food. So this is what it looks like. The chocolate is a little bit melted. Yeah, I would try it without the curry so you can see what the taste is like. Yeah, I'm not dipping this in the sauce. And we have a cat friend. We may have to feed the cat friend. Mmmm. It is like the sugar is a little bit caramelized. And that is quite nice. Man, this would be nice with a cup of tea. Do you taste the chocolate-y-ness of it? Oh yeah. That is the star. The chocolate. Mmmm. You know what? Let's see how chocolate and spice goes together. Yeah, you can do that. You can mix your chocolate. Why not right? Why not. When in Malaysia. Yeah, alright. Time to try this. In he goes for the Milo. Yeah, you can really see how it is kind of caramelized here. I can actually see the little flakes. Little grains of sugar I should say. Not flakes. Yeah. Mmmm. Mmmm. That is really good. You know what would be a really good one? Getting a banana roti with milo on top. Do they have that? If they did. We missed out. They had no bananas. That is one of the things we asked for. Oh right. Banana roti. No banana roti. Right. I'm just remembering that now. That would be amazing if you combined those two together. Womp, womp. And look. Here is our cat friend. Meow meows. Sam feed our cat friend. Come here cat friend. Meow meows. So this cat eats roti and dal. Good kitty. That is a good breakfast. So Sam was true to his word and this is his third drink because he already had two teas. Yeah, this is technically our forth drink we've ordered. Because I've had two teas myself. You've had your mango drink and now we're doing this. We're full. Like take a look here. We have finished all our roti. All of our roti. All three of them. So we are doing this for you guys. Let's try it. Milo. Ooh. That is sweet. It is like having uh. It is like having instant hot chocolate mix. Yeah? Oh yeah. That is really sugary. By the time I'm done this I'm going to be on like a fierce sugar high for the rest of the day. Like we have just we have been eating a lot of sweet things this morning. We have. And you know what? For the milo you can get it hot or you can get it iced. We probably should have gone with iced. Probably. Because the sun is starting to come out and temperatures are getting hot. I'm already sweating. So yeah. So that is a wrap for breakfast here in Kuala Lumpur. Yeah, I'm really really stuffed right now. Uh huh. As you should be. As I should be. In terms of price point that came to 18.70 Ringgit which is $4.15 and that was for four drinks and three mains. So yeah, that was a super cheap breakfast. Filling. Now we're ready to go explore. And you know what? We should also mention before we finish up. Oh yeah. There isn't just one typical Malaysian breakfast. Because you have so many different cultures here. There is like different meals that you can get for breakfast. There is Malay, Chinese, Indian food. Yeah. In fact, we saw someone at the Central Market selling little triangle shaped Nasi Lemak. Which is wrapped in a banana leaf and yeah that looked tempting as well too. So you can get noodles, you can get rice, you can get roti. There is plenty of variety. And that is what makes it awesome here. Yeah. Alright, off to go sightseeing. Tata. Ciao. Welcome to Chinatown! Yeah, so we're in Kuala Lumpur in Chinatown. This is where we're staying. Yes. We're hungry. We're craving some street food and this is just the place to check it out. Yeah, so today we're going to be eating along Jalan Petaling (茨厂街). Yeah, Petaling Night Market Street (茨廠街). Yeah, lots of food here and it is already busy. The sun has gone down so let's go get started. Food time. Okay, so we walked out of the hotel and we found. We found something right away. Oh yeah. It is claypot chicken rice and it looks so good from across the street. It is cooking right behind us. Literally right behind us. It looks so good. We can't wait for it to arrive. In the meantime you've got yourself a local iced tea. Ice tea. It is so hot out. I tried a little bit of it already. It is quite sweet. Alright, the claypot chicken rice (砂煲鸡饭) is here. Check it out. It is served in like this claypot itself so I'm being very careful not to touch it because I have a feeling this would burn. So there you go. It is a huge portion. I'm glad we ordered just one. There is no way I could eat all of that. I have to say the aroma. The smell coming out of there is it just smells amazing. I don't know how it is going to taste but it just smells so good. And let me serve some up for you. Thank you. Appreciate that. For the Mister. Okay, and if my voice sounds a little washed out it is because I have a fan blowing next to my head right now. I do apologize guys. Let's get some chicken, some rice. Here we go. How is that? Wow. It is super hot. Oh my gosh. That is really good. I'm just staring over there because they're making it right now. I have no idea what went in to the sauce but it is amazing. It is really good and it also has some chives in there. And the chicken is super tender and juicy. This is really nice. I'm so excited to try this now. I'm going to blow on it. Because you pre-warned me about it being too hot. Yeah! Pretty good right? Yeah, it is really amazing. You know what it actually kind of reminds me. It reminds me a little bit of the glutinous rice wrappers we were having as dim sum. It sort of has a similar consistency but obviously the sauce is different. Yeah. It is just a very flavorful rice. Yeah. Really good quality chicken and I think just the fact that it is cooked in a claypot there is an extra I don't know like element of quality to this. Yeah. You know. I mean I wouldn't say it is quite as sticky as the wrapper rice. No, it is not as sticky but it just has like that amount of flavor. Yeah, it is good. f And just look at the size of this. I know. It is massive. I feel like this is even way too big for two people. And this is what we're starting off with. Yeah. There is more food ahead. I'm glad we're hungry. And from so many years of eating dolsot bibimbap with the burned crispy rice in Korea, Sam has been scratching the bottom of the claypot. Burnt rice. It is always the best part. Yeah, it is nice when it is crispy. Crispy rice at the bottom is the best part for sure. Mission accomplished. Yeah, we took care of that. Mostly Sam took care of that. Yeah. So in terms of price point it was 22 Ringgit which is about five bucks and that included the massive portion of claypot rice (砂煲鸡饭) and also the drink that we shared. Alright, so let's move on to snack number two. Yeah. So it is not just about the street food at this market. You can also buy lots of knock-offs of everything. Shoes. Purses. Watches. Shirts. Makeup. So we just popped in to a food centre here in the heart of Chinatown and we are ordering more food. We are having fried kway teow (炒粿條 - 炒粿条) and this is a noodle dish that is cooked at really high heat. Apparently, Sam ordered two different types of noodles so it is going to be a mix of thin noodles and really thick noodles. Um, and yeah it is cooked with soy sauce, chili, chives, beansprouts and we'll see what else is in there once the food actually arrives. So waiting for the noodles and cooling down with some beer. Absolutely. Cheers! It is a must in KL. I mean it gets so hot and humid. Having a beer while you know wandering around the night market. That is kind of a must for me. The fried kway teow (炒粿條 - 炒粿条) has arrived. Yes, so excited about this. So take a look down here. So the nice lady who took my order she asked me if I would like to have the thin noodles like this. Like so. And I said yes and she also asked me if I would like to have the thicker noodles. And I said yes. So we got a combination of the two. So yeah, I'm seeing beansprouts, I'm seeing cooked egg. I did ask for a fried egg to be added to this. And yeah, it is dark in color from the soy sauce. Lots of chili flakes. Lots of chili flakes too. And of course we have festive Christmas music happening because it is December. Man, that is really good. This is like a classic staple noodle dish in Malaysia. Yeah. It is just so good. Such reliable food. You can have it on the street, you can have it in a restaurant, you can have it in a food centre like we're doing right now. It is always good. Alright, my turn. Man, this is tricky. Are you forgetting how to use chopsticks? I promise I know how to use chopsticks. It is just noodles. I can't do it. Also, let me show off my henna. It is still intact guys. One day latter. All the way. Oh what fun it is to ride in one horse open sleigh. Hey! Jingle bells. That is good. Isn't that good? It is really nice. Yeah. You know what? This isn't a great thing to admit but I like the greasy aspect of it too. It is nice and greasy. Yeah. Do you agree? Well Sam finished off all the food and the lady who cooked it up seemed very impressed to see an empty plate. Yeah, she came over and she said how did you like that? It was good. And I ate about eighty percent of it so yeah I would know. I'm so full. We're only on the second dish but. We've been eating so much in Malaysia. We have been and that first dish we had the claypot rice was quite filling in a big portion. But I've still got some room. We're going to hit the streets and get some more tasty treats. But first tell us the price. How must was it? Oh right, so that was 5.50 Ringgit which is about at present exchange about a dollar, a dollar twenty a dollar twenty five. Yeah. So super affordable, delicious and reliable food here in KL. And was that the small portion or the large? That was the small. Alright, so you can get an even bigger noodle portion. Yeah. It doesn't cost that much more to upgrade to large. I think it is like another dollar or two Ringgit. An extra Ringgit. Yeah. Yeah. Alright, let's keep moving. Sugarcane! Juice. So we found a quiet little corner in this insane market. I think the only reason we have a quiet corner is because whoever runs this stand has gone home. And now they're just piling garbage here. So here we are enjoying some juice. Freshly pressed sugarcane juice. Wow. Is that good? Yeah. Naturally sweet? Yeah? Mmmm. I don't know if I've ever had this before? Are you serious? Yeah. Oh, I've done this. I have done this. This is really good. It is like super sweet but it is so natural at the same time. Yeah. It doesn't feel processed. Mmmm. Cheers! So yet another attempt for me to cool down a bit. Yeah. So far we've had iced tea, you had beer, now sugarcane juice. What is next? We're running out of drinks to try. I have seen some coconuts. But yeah. But we're still thirsty. That is the thing. It doesn't matter how much we guzzle we're always thirsty here. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, this is pretty good. Like you said very naturally sweet. Mmmhmm. And it came to 3.50 Ringgit for the small one. So that is about 75 or 80 cents right now. So yeah, cheap under a dollar and refreshing naturally good. I like it. I love the name of these. We have wife cake (老婆餅 - 老婆饼) and husband we have husband cake (老公饼). So Sam here is going to sample a wife cake (老婆餅 - 老婆饼). A wife cake. And I believe there is melon inside of it. I'm just going to take an enormous bite. So it looks like a golden puff pastry. Mmm. Oh it looks flaky too. Mmmm. Yeah. You can taste that melon. Really flaky on the outside. It is kind of sweet but not that sweet. Like I thought it would be sweeter than this. And it is um very buttery and flaky on the outside and then you have that kind of nice chewy melon in the middle. If we were feeling hungrier we would have also ordered a husband cake. Yeah, we're just getting too full at this point. But you know we're stuffed and we're still not finished. Huh. So yeah, this shop has a lot of different pastries. They are mostly Hong Kong style. Mmmm. You're right. I was expecting more sugar for some reason. It is sweet but like mildly sweet. Yeah. Hmmm. Interesting. And how much were they? 1.80 Ringgit. So you're the mathematician. La la lah. I don't know. That is probably about 30 something cents. 30 or 40 cents. There you go. Really cheap. And they have even smaller ones. These are super cheap. 55 cents. Woah. Okay. This is our last snack of the night. Absolute last. And yeah, I was pretty much already full and I'm like okay I'll try one more thing. So we're getting a small little ice cream. Red bean coconut milk ice cream. It was only 2 Ringgit. So like something like 40 cents. So cheap. I figured why not? So let's try it. Mmmm. Wow. That is good. Yeah? Yeah. You taste the coconut milk and you do taste the red bean as well. As you would expect. But I mean it is nice to see. I don't know sometimes a food claims to be something it is not. Oh it should taste like this but it doesn't taste anything like it. This tastes exactly how it should taste like. Coconut milk. Rich coconut milk and then lots of sugar and then the beans. Good stuff. Good stuff. Alright. Food adventures over! Food adventure over. Woah. Alright, so we've been at the market for about an hour and a half. Yeah. I don't know if you can see but we are glistening right now. Like there is some serious glow happening. Yeah. I don't know if that is like the meat sweats or just the temperature or the two things combined. I'm pretty sure it is both. Anyways, calling that a night here from Kuala Lumpur. Yeah. Definitely, definitely if you're visiting this city get in to the street food. It is fantastic and it is cheap and it is fun. It is a great way to spend a night out. Yeah, and we'll see you with more food videos soon. Bye bye. Well good morning good morning. Today we are having a late breakfast. It is probably close to ten in the morning and we're at a place called Old Town White Coffee. So we're going to be having Nasi Lemak which is one of the national dishes of Malaysia. And it basically consists of rice cooked in coconut milk. Steamed with coconut milk. So that should be really tasty. We've ordered two different varities. Sam already has his white coffee here so he'll be having that. And you have? And I got I forget what I got. Something with lime. Lime juice? Lime tea? Lime juice? I had a sip of it and it has a natural nice lime flavor. Oh la lah. So try that out. Really sour. That will wake you up in the morning. Yeah. So considering the name of this restaurant. It is called OldTown White Coffee. And the reason we're laughing is because I screwed this up on the previous clip. It is called Old Town White Coffee and white coffee is basically it is a coffee that originated from the city of Ipoh. So if you're traveling from Kuala Lumpur to Penang you're going to pass along. Probably pass thorugh there. Yeah, you're going to pass along that it is on the west side of Malaysia. Anyways um the coffee is really cool because it has condensed milk. It is made with condensed milk. Yeah, to sweeten it. And it is a lighter roast as well. Yeah, exactly. You can even see that in the color. It is a uniquely Malaysian coffee. So let's try that. Were you about to say Manilan? It is a Manilan coffee! It is a Manilin coffee. No. We are struggling this morning. We've just woken up. English words are not being spoken. Yeah but at least your first language is Spanish. I don't have a default language to fall back on. When I'm not speaking English well there is nothing else to fall back on. So anyways what I wanted to say it has a nice rich, frothy texture. There we go. You can definitely taste the condensed milk and you can also taste the sugar that has been added in as well. But yeah, it is a lighter roast and it doesn't have that strong like overpowering coffee taste. Bitterness. Yeah, it doesn't have that bitterness and it is a little bit more palattable and it goes down a little bit easier. Yeah, so we have a bit of a funny situation on our hands. What is that? So we ordered two mains and dessert. We were hoping the dessert would come after but it was the first thing to show up. Haha. And it is made with ice so this is going to start melting which means we have to eat it first now. In fact, it already is melting. Yeah, look it is like soupy. Um, so anyways this is Cendol and basically it is ice with coconut milk. It has palm sugar which you can see in here. Then this green stringy stuff. It can be made from rice flour or mung bean. We also have some rice balls here at the bottom. Yeah, and this I'm not entirely sure. Oh, this is probably the red bean paste. Yeah that would be it. Alright. Okay, so let's grab. And it is the best dessert slash drink that you can have in Malaysia to cool down. Especially mid-afternoon when you're like dying of the heat and humidity. Haha. Mmmm. When you're walking around. That is really nice. Is that nice? Mmmm. So refreshing isn't it? So sweet and refreshing. I even think this is like coconut cream. It is not even milk. It is so rich and thick. Oh wow. Good stuff huh? And then the palm sugar. Palm sugar. I have to say I really like palm sugar. Yeah. We've been having a lot of desserts and they usually bring you like this miniature picture filled with palm sugar and I just pour it all over my desserts so let's just go all out. Mmmmm. Well, we're starting off with something sweet. I can't say I mind really. Dessert for breakfast. Yeah, you know what? We're that is not too much of a stretch for us. We're the type of people that would eat dessert for breakfast. We've been known to have cake for breakfast. Oh yeah. Cheesecake, cheesecake for breakfast. Of course. Why wouldn't you? If it is available. Hahaha. What do you think? You're right. That is really good. Yeah. Really rich coconut taste which I love. And then just the refreshingness of the ice and then all of the other ingredients. I like the that there is some chewy components to it. Like the beans and also the little green strips. Those are really good. I can't say I've ever had Cendol with the little rice balls. That is something new. And it kind of reminds me of the rice balls we would have in South Korea. So yeah, this is really refreshing. Really tasty and we do need to finish it before it melts. Okay, so we got two different kinds of Nasi Lemak. Yeah. Sam, do you remember the name of yours? I better say it quickly. Ayam Masakamara. And ayam means chicken. Yes. And it looks like it has a kind of a I'm guessing it might be a spicy kind of gravy on top of it. So I'm going to go for the chicken first. That looks good. I'll have a bite of that. Oh. Mmmm. At first you think it is just really sweet with a lot of like uh ingredients and spices but then it really hits you with the hot peppery spices as you're swallowing it. Woah. That is spicy. And what else do you have on your plate? So what else. I have coconut milk rice. So it is rice that has been cooked in coconut milk. And that is really really tasty. That is probably my favorite part of a Nasi Lemak. Really good. And then over here we have what appears to be some crackers. So I'm just going to use it as a little spoon. Mmmm. This is nice and light. Super light. Not a strong taste there. And then over here we have the sambal. Sambal. And that is supposed to be a spicy and sweet sauce. We'll see how spicy it is. It actually is. Mmmmm. That is really really good. Yeah, it is spicy but it is really sweet too. It is very very sweet. Very rich in its taste. And then cucumber. To finish off we have some cucumber with it. So yeah. I think the classic is actually supposed to come with peanuts but maybe because we ordered chicken they didn't put the peanuts in it. Yeah, that is what I think. I was hoping for those. The roasted peanuts are really good. I like those. I know but the chicken is delicious though. Oh yeah. Alright my turn. Okay, so I had initially ordered the tumeric chicken but they didn't have any! It was gone. So my backup plan was chicken curry. Curried chicken. How do you say it? Chicken curry. Curry chicken. Curry chicken. No, I think it was chicken curry. Man, it is interchangeable. The fat. I don't like the fat. There I like my meat lean. So I'll get a bit of this. I actually thought it would be kind of like diced chicken in a thick curry. That is what I'm used to when I order curry. Liked diced chicken breast. I know. Getting fancy. Okay, so let's just grab a bit of everything. Chicken, rice and sambal. Mmmmm. Is that good? Wow. The sauce kind of has a fishy flavor. It does. Yeah, it does. Like anchovies. I should have mentioned that. Yeah. I wasn't. Definitely. Woah. Definitely anchovies. This is hitting me right now. And what is the other. You have something else too? Yeah. That is different from ours. It looks like it could be some potato wedges or something. Let's see. What is that? It is potato. Yeah. It is like a boiled potato but I think then it has been pan-fried lightly to make it kind of golden and crispy. Yep. So what do you think of the Nasi Lemak? It is pretty good. Yeah. Do you like the coconut rice? Mmmm. I do. Yeah. That is my favorite part. It is not like a super strong coconut flavor. I'm not sure I'd notice on my own right away. My taste buds aren't that refined. But it is good. And I've been eating this at the hotel for breakfast as well in the mornings and they kind of have like the do it yourself thing where you can scoop out the rice yourself grab some peanuts and anchovies. The sambal. The little veggies. So it is a dish that I feel a bit familiar with. Yeah, oh man but the sambal. It is really hitting me today. Yeah. And the other thing we should point out is that you can have this anytime of day. It is breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack or whatever. It is readily available. Um, it is so easy to find. Basically pop into in fact most restaurants have it I would say. Okay, so that was a big breakfast meal. That is a really big breakfast. If you're not that hungry you probably shouldn't order that. That was a really big breakfast. Anyways, in terms of price point that came to 42.90 Ringgit which is just under$10 US dollars. Nine something. And yeah, that was for two drinks, two mains and a dessert. So yeah. And you can find this place inside the Central Market here in KL. Yeah. We probably didn't need the dessert for breakfast but you know that is just the way we roll. Bloopers. So considering the name of this restaurant. It is called Old Time White. What is it? Old Town. It is called Old Town. Try that again. White coffee. And we're going to be having Nasi Lemak which is like one of the traditional breakfasts. Break-fasts. Breakfast. We're going to be having Nasi Lemak. Which is one of the traditional break-fasts. Breakfasts. It actually has a kind of a rich frothy flavor. No. It has a rich flothy. Frothy. Coffee has a rich frothy. What do I call it rich frothy flavor. And this is pretty cool. At the back of the restaurant they have these sinks you can come and wash your hands. Since you'll most likely be eating with your hands. Exactly. Oh, look at that he's using soap and everything. This is marvelous. Hahaha. Husband training is going wonderfully guys. So it is lunchtime here in Kuala Lumpur and we're eating at one of our favorite restaurants. It is located in Chinatown and it is called Yusoof Dan Zakhir. Hard one to pronounce. And they specialize in Indian food. And there is so much variety here. Like Sam is going to give you a little tour of the restaurant but there are just so many different stations. And look what just came. The juice is here. That is amazing. Thank you. Mango. So we got mango juice. But yeah, like I was saying there are so many different stations. There is like a tandoori station, a naan station. There is an area where like the food is already prepared and you just kind of like point and choose what you want to have. And there is a juicing station and yeah there is just a lot going on here. The food is great. I'm super excited to eat here. Something else that is really cool is the location is ideal. It is just right across to the right from the entrance of the Central Market. Yeah, so. Great location. Yeah, and this place is packed. Like all day long. And that is how you know it is a good restaurant. So Sam, as usual is feeling parched and couldn't quite make up his mind with the drinks. So I basically always get a Teh Tarik wherever I go now. And if we're eating like local food it is available I get it. It is just so good. It is so cheap. And I'm going to try it here. Oh man. It is just like the flavor of it combined with the milk and the sugar. And the fact that it is so cheap. That is why I keep ordering it all of the time. Alright, and aside from that you've got some mango juice. That is really refreshing. Yeah. Lots of ice cubes in there. Alright guys, so the food has arrived all at once. Our table is like packed with plates and bowls and dishes. So I'm going to start with the cheese naan. We ordered two different types of naan today. Cheese and garlic. Oh man, and these are like fresh out of the oven. This is like burning my fingers. Yeah. It is really cool to see the tandoori oven. Yeah. So anyways, I can feel already it is very fluffy and light. Um, and you can see the melted cheese in there as well. It is just like your plain sliced cheese. They just put it in the middle and it gets all ooey and gooey. And I'm going to dip it in my dal here. Oh la lah. That is so good. Is it? Oh man. Because we normally get the roti here. We haven't had the naan. This is amazing. It just reminds me of homemade bread. Yeah, like fresh out of the oven. It is so warm. And still soft and fluffy. And then when you add it with the dal and the curry it is just such a nice addition to it. Yeah. Alright now we're going to try the garlic one. So I got the garlic naan and you can get all kinds of different naan here. There is like cheese naan, garlic naan. Butter naan. But I prefer the garlic naan and butter and cheese naan to just plain naan. And look a that you can see the chunks of garlic. Yeah, you sure can. Large pieces. For example look at that. Oh man. And roasted garlic is just the best. Yeah, so love just breaking off a piece taking it for a swim. Wow. Hahaha. Nothing quite beats the freshness of freshly baked naan. I know it is like coming out of your mouth. But you know what I think would be amazing? Combining garlic with cheese. And butter. No, garlic, cheese and butter and maybe even something else. That would be like the ultimate naan ever. Yeah that would be like a triple naan. A triple naan. Going in for another bite. It is so good. This is so good. Oh la lah. Oh man. Maybe we can break off one piece of each and turn it into a little dal sandwich. There you go. Naan dal sandwich. Next up we're going to try the chicken tandoori. And it is really cool seeing how they prepare this. Because they basically put the chicken on these giant skewers and then the skewer goes in to the tandoori oven and they're just cooking in there. Guess what guys? I'm going to show you where that is right now. It is right over there. But back to the plate. So here we've got tandoori. Just look at that. It is all red on the exterior. Coated in spices. Oh, and they serve it with cucumbers, red onions and we've got a little bit of lemon or lime it seems. Yellow lime. Why don't you spray that all over. Oh yeah! Oh look at that. It is dripping all over. And I just love putting lemon and lime on food. It is such a nice addition huh? Yeah. It makes it nice and tart. Love it! The more the better. So I'll take a piece here. Mmmm. Hahaha. In your happy zone? This is heaven. This is so nice. It is like spicy and hot but then ah it is just so juicy at the same time. I don't know. I just really like it. Does it have kind of a smoky flavor? A bit. It has like a barbecue-y flavor. But I don't mean like barbecue sauce. It is kind of like more the oven grilling it. The way it is cooked. Yeah, just the way it is cooked. So yeah, this is really nice. And they chop it in to pieces for you. So you can use your hands or you can use your fork and spoon. Either way will do. But yeah, this is really really good. I'm going to get one more piece here. And I'm going to grab some onion and some cucumber. And squeeze more lemon on it. So it is the perfect bite. That is good. Okay, so Sam is going in for the chicken. Yeah, my turn to try it. I often think when I think of tandoori chicken I think of that place that we used to like in Penang as well. Do you remember that spot? Oh yeah. Kapitan. Restaurant Kapitan. That is another really good one. That is the one. I had just forgotten the name. You know we're the kind of people who travel places for restaurants. I've done visa runs in Penang just for the food. It is that good. And for the visa. Yeah, if you need to like extend your Thai Visa go to Penang and eat well for a few days and get your Thai Visa. Great great idea. So yeah, what do you think of the chicken? The tandoori. It is awesome. Like you said, I love the crispiness on the outside and just the amount of flavors and spices that are on there. And the colors. Yeah, look at the colors. It is just a really nice cut of. A really nice cut of meat. It is juicy and just really tender and really tasty. Yeah, it is just fantastic. Fantastic. So the other thing we ordered was a curry. And this is a fish masala. This is a fish masala. So you can see it comes in a generous gravy and I've just been hacking away at it here. Um, you can probably. I'll just go like this so that you can see the meat a little bit better. Check that out. Careful with the bones. Careful with the bones. I feel like there may be bones in there. Yeah, I'm going to cut it really small just in case. There we go. Just going in for that bite. I'll get lots of the gravy. And they actually specialize in fish curries at this restaurant. They have a really famous fish head curry. Oh but it was a bit pricey. That sauce is just to die for. It is just so good. So rich. So spicy too. It is one of those type of spice that it doesn't hit you until you really swallow it a few times. But really good. And the fish is really just melts. It falls apart in your mouth. So that was delicious. I didn't get any bones in that bite so that was nice. Alright, we've got some nice things to finish off with here. So I would just like to point out that from one second to the next the garlic naan. I had half of a garlic naan disappeared from my plate. I'm pretty sure I didn't eat it. You know what? I think our plates got mixed up and I just got hungry. Sam is like no I was eating out of my plate. It is like how is mine empty. How? We're kind of bad for doing that to each other aren't we? Anyways, I'm going to the cheese naan now I guess. The garlic one was really good. And I'm just going to dip the naan in the masala. In the fish masala. I want to get some sauce first. Let's see. I think you're going to like that sauce. Wow. It is kind of sweet as well. Yeah, it is. It is like sweet and spicy. Yeah. Wow. Lots of flavor huh? That is really good. Okay. Let's try it with the fish. So now let's grab some fish. Oh man. That is potent. Ah, it is hitting me in the back of the throat. It has like delayed onset in terms of the spice. Okay, so I got a little bit of a spoon and the fish it still has the skin and it also has a little bit of bone. So it is kind of hard to like break it apart and find the bones because there is so much sauce and it is really thick. So you want to be careful when you take your bite. Mmmm. That is really tender. Yeah, I know. Wow. It just disintegrates in your mouth doesn't it? You barely have to even chew it. I think I have some bones in there though. Yeah? Excuse me. Restaurant is shutting down for prayers. So we've got to go. We paid the bill. How much was it? So it was 35 Ringgit which is at current exchange is seven dollars and seventy cents. Yeah. So that was for four food items, three drinks. So seven things in total. Yeah. So yeah. A cheap and delicious meal. Really good food. We are stuffed. Yeah but I still think we've got room for a little dessert so we're going to take you outside and I'm going to try to find a durian popsicle. And I think you're going to get a juice right? Yes. So yeah. Alright. Come join us. Let's go. So Sam found a shop specializing in all things durian. Yeah, I've kind of been on a quest since we've been in KL to try as many different durian things as possible because I love it. Yeah. You're not a fan but I am. I can't stand the smell of it. I really am. So this is a durian popsicle. Yeah, and this shop sells all kinds of different durian things. It is literally just outside of the Central Market too. So I mean we walked from here like 20 meters over here. Yeah. Anyways if we had smell-o-vision this would smell like rotten fruit and garlic. That is what I think it smells like. Oh man, you can tell. But Sam just thinks it is magical. Mmmm. Magical popsicle. Yeah, this is being made. This is definitely made with real durian. Yeah. It is really really good. Sweet. And it has the overpowering durian taste and smell too. That most people hate. Yeah, and which I love. Ahh. And price point. Yeah, I almost forgot to mention the price. So it was two Ringgit and ten cents which is about 40 US dollars. Sorry 40 US cents I should say. Four dollars. Who is paying four dollars for that. Yeah, that would be crazy. So yeah for 40 cents. A good deal. Okay, and I'm going to get myself some juice. Juicing juicing. He be juicing. Actually Sam is not juicing right now. He's counting his coins. I'm counting my coins. I'm actually saving up for one more popsicle. It was so good I'm going to get another one for the way home. Tada. So I cannot do durian because it tastes awful but this has jackfruit and jackfruit looks similar to durian. And it also has a whole bunch of other fruits. It has passion fruit and mango. And a whole bunch of other things. And it is delicious. So if someone is coming to Juiceee with three E's at the end what kind should they order do you think? Which one is this? A Jolly Jack for the Holidays. And this is where you shot shot shot shot. Everybody! Chug chug chug. No not chug. This song is shots. You're just out of the loop. It is an old song Sam. Look at that. I downed it. I downed it. One shot.",False,20170410 - Ultimate Malaysian Street Food Tour in Kuala Lumpur ≡ƒç▓≡ƒç╛ ∩╜£ Must-Eat Malaysian Dishes at Night Markets.en.srt

We had 4 days to discover what the city was all about, so we set out to visit the main attractions, sample Chilean food, and explore various neighborhoods on foot. We may not have been able to see it all, but the following is our experience in the city. For anyone planning a similar trip, here's a look at 20 things to do in Santiago de Chile on your visit: So today we are visiting Santa Lucia hill. This is actually an extinct volcano right in the middle of the city. It is 69 meters tall and we're going to go check it out. Santa Lucia is an urban park smack dab in the middle of Santiago and it’s a popular hangout in the afternoons and weekends. The hike is a pleasant one with lots to see, including fountains, spiraling staircases, defensive forts, sprawling gardens, and cool lookout points. Lastarria is a neighbourhood located just east of Santa Lucia hill and it was once the bohemian hub of the city.Today it is very popular with tourists as it offers an outdoors flea market, an international mix of cafes and restaurants, and live music. And now we're going to take you to what we think is the best ice cream shop in town. It is called Emporio La Rosa. Lots of great selections and we've been coming here almost every single day we've been in Santiago. So that says something. A little bit more than we'd like to admit. Yes. Let's go in. Sam, you got your favorite flavor. Want to show us? Yes, dulce de leche, right here. Dulce de leche. Let's take the first bite. I mean they gave such a generous portion here that not only do we get a cone but we also get a cup as well. So it doesn't melt and overflow. I really like that idea. They should do that in more places around the world. Okay. Are you having a moment there? That is divine. You know what, you know what really makes this dulce de leche flavor so good. Especially at this place is that it is a little bit salty. Normally it is just really really sweet but there is this kind of little tinge of salt that just makes it awesome. That is unusual. Love it. Love it. So I got some ice cream as well of course. So this is actually raspberries and mint. So, I'm not a huge fan of mint but I really like raspberry. Now that is an interesting combo. I've never had that before. What can you taste more? The raspberry or the mint? Definitely the raspberry? Yeah. Not too much mint? The mint is a very subtle aftertaste. It just makes it a little bit more refreshing. So yeah, I'm a fan of this one. I'd recommend it. For panoramic views of the city, ride the funicular to the top of San Cristobal Hill. You can catch the funicular at Pio Nono station, and either pay to stop halfway up the hill at the zoo, or ride all the way to the summit. Keep in mind that the lines tend to be a bit longer on weekends, especially as you approach sunset. Okay, so we rode the funicular and we made it to the top of San Cristobal Hill. And you get some pretty cool spectacular views. You can see the Andes and they look like they're within reach. I know, it almost makes me want to go climb them but I'm a little too lazy. I think we'll go get food instead. Another time. So it is time for a little afternoon snack in Santiago. Today we're at a restaurant called Galindo and we're going to be trying a dish that is called Chorrillana. And this is a lot like a Canadian poutine. Now if you're not too familiar with Canadian poutine that is kind of like when you get some French Fries with gravy and cheese and other ingredients over top. So this is going to be similar but with a Chilean twist so we're waiting for the food to arrive now. Well as you can see the food has arrived and the funny part is this is listed as an appetizer or a starter for one person. If you have a look at that, that is enough to feed two grown people. I think Sam and I are going to struggle with this. It is our main. It is our main. For two. Definitely. Alright Sam, so it is time to give us the tour of the plate. Yes, so before I tuck into this tasty little treat I'm going to explain what we've got here. So we have tenderloin, onion and scrambled egg on top of those french fries. It is actually a little bit different from the first time we tried Chorrillana because that had a fried egg on top and also sausage. Yes. But this has a lot more meat. This is a very generous portion. So dig right in hungry boy. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Yeah. Enjoying that? Oh, yeah. Wow, those are like really tasty onions. You can tell they've been marinated in something. I think they're caramelized. Yeah, caramelized onions I think. And the french fries are a golden perfection. It is just going to be an awesome filling carb loaded delicious little treat. So we've had this dish a few times since we've arrived in Santiago and no two Chorrillanas are the same. This one is different, I mean it has no sausage or hot dogs and that was our first experience trying Chorrillanas. And also this one has scrambled eggs instead of fried egg on top. So it is kind of nice that you can always find a bit of variety when you go to a different restaurant. And I think I am ready for my first bite. Got a little bit of everything in there. Mmmm. Wow. That meat is tender isn't it? It is tender. It is tenderloin, so it should be tender. It should be tender. Wow. That is nice. In a way it is kind of nice that they only have the beef and there is no sausage because like this is a really good cut of meat. It is very juicy so the flavors really come through. You don't have too many competing tastes. Yeah, you don't need a whole lot of ingredients with this dish. Not when it is done well. Plaza de Armas is the heart of Santiago’s historic centre and it’s not a bad place to do some people watching. There are lots of benches under the cover of palm trees, and the place is buzzing with activity no matter the time of day. Hi, pup. You're getting a massage. Are you enjoying your massage. You have a nice smile pup. The Metropolitan Cathedral is located in the historic centre of Santiago overlooking the square. The construction you see today dates back to the year 1800, since previous cathedrals were destroyed in earthquakes. When it comes to sunsets, Santiago knows how to put on a show. The best-known spot in town for 360 degree views of the city is Sky Costanera, with an observatory that is open from 10 am to 10 pm. Alternatively, you could enjoy the free views from one of the city’s residential skyscrapers like we did. Since we were renting an AirBnB apartment for the duration of our stay, we had access to our building’s rooftop terrace and the views were pretty spectacular. And a way to cool down here in Santiago is to go and get yourself a Pisco Sour. This is a really refreshing drink. Basically, it is a pisco brandy which is a grape brandy and then you combine that with citrus juice and there is egg white on top. And if you can see this there is a little bit of a brown kind of caramel color. It is called bitter. That is bitter, exactly. So let's try this out to see if it is good. Salut! Yeah, that's real nice. Very refreshing, very sweet but also quite tart as well. Santiago’s Central Market is the place to come for the freshest food. Inside the market you’ll find butchers and fishmongers - it’s okay to skip that part - but if you continue your exploration, you’ll find rows of restaurants serving up everything from grilled fish to ceviche. We really like our ceviche, so we found a place serving exactly that. (Music Playing) Parque Forestal is a park that forms a long stretch of greenery along the Mapocho River. It’s a nice green escape in the middle of the city and we noticed it was really popular with couples who were just lounging around on the grass. Palacio de la Moneda is the seat of the President of the Republic of Chile. This is where you can come to watch the changing of the guard, but keep in mind that it only happens every other day. We just missed it! Just underneath Palacio de La Moneda, you’ll find Centro Cultural Palacio La Moneda, which is a cultural centre featuring exhibitions, design shops, and a small selection of cafes. It’s a nice place to cool down and check out some art if it’s a really hot day out. So we found this empanada shop. It is called Zunino and it was packed. It is probably about one thirty right now so the line really was stretching out of the establishment but we managed to place our order. We ordered one cheese empanada and one pino empanada. What is kind of unique about that place is that is all that they do. They only have these two varieties. You either get your pino beef or your cheese. So it is a very small selection but I think that means they really know how to make a good empanada. Alright, and I'm having the cheese one and it is still piping hot. This looks really cool. I can tell that the pastry, already before biting into it, is going to be really flaky. Yeah. Mmmm. Is that the cheese one for real? Or is it beef? Oh, yeah that is the cheese one. Oh yeah. I don't know how you can tell. And you know what? This is really good quality one. Like you can tell just from. If you can get close up in on the pastry here. The attention to detail of the pastry like it is just so flaky, lots of layers, buttery and is just melting right in my mouth and then that gooey cheese. Oh, that is just a winning combo. Alright, so I tried the cheese ones. The cheese one was really tasty. Now time for Pino. Mmmm. Have a look in there. Juicy. Look at that. So, this one has beef, onions and olive. That I've got the pit in my mouth right now. Excuse me. And it also has egg but I haven't bitten into that part yet. So like it is really nice and juicy inside. It is still warm. What surprises me though is the size. Like when we made our empanada video in San Pedro de Atacama like those were massive empanadas. They were almost like bigger than like a main course plate. But these are more snack sized right? Yeah, I would say they are about half the size of the ones we had in Atacama. Um, so yeah I kind of like it because I struggled to finish those big ones. Like the ones we had in Atacama were really good for sharing but this is like a good individual size. So it is not going to ruin your lunch or dinner so long as you have it as a snack. Mmmm...hmmmm. And the quality? It is really good. Look at those onions. Ooh. So apparently there is a bit of a craft beer scene here in Santiago. And Sam, you've just been sampling everything you can. Yeah, there really is. Well, it has been really hot in Santiago lately so in all fairness to my defense. Excuses, excuses. But this is really good quality craft beer. Um, a lot of the ones I've been having have actually tasted a little bit like grapefruit, so I'm interested to see what this one over here tastes like. Do you remember the name of it? Schopp. What kind of chopp? This is amber. Amber schopp. Alright. And it does have a little bit of a grapefruit taste. Why does it taste like grapefruit? I don't know. That is the way they make craft beer over here. They've got some kind of secret here in Chile. It tastes good. Bellavista is a neighborhood located just northeast of the city centre. It’s a cultural hub with lots of theatres, cinemas, cafes, museums, and restaurants. The most famed home in the neighbourhood is La Chascona, the home of the famed Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. Unfortunately, no filming or photography is allowed inside the premises. When it comes to art, you have a few choices. Just across Parque Forestal, you’ll find the National Fine Arts Museum focusing on Chilean paintings and sculptures. And then directly behind this museum, you’ll come across the Museum of Contemporary Art, which focuses on pieces from the turn of the 19th century. Last but not least, you can wander around the small neighbourhood of Paris-Londres. This neighborhood features cobbled streets, restored mansions, and it’s a nice little walk if you’re in the area. And that's a wrap for the Chilean capital! We hope you enjoyed this Santiago travel guide and that it gave you a few ideas of things to do, places to visit, and Chilean dishes to try in the city. As always, if you have any suggestion of things travellers should add to their Santiago itinerary, feel free to share those with us in the comments below. So, hello from Valparaiso. That means paradise on the valley. We have a few days to explore the city and we're planning to do most of it on foot. Yes, and most of it is going up hills as well. And there is so much cool street art here. So we're going to be taking a few different walking tours while we're in town. Today we're doing the first one which should be an overview of the city. And it should be fun. So we're going to take you on a little guided tour of Valparaiso. Yee-haw! To say Valparaiso is a bit hilly would be an understatement. The city is a maze of steep inclines which means the best way to get around and save your legs for sightseeing, is by riding up and down the funiculars. It might seem a bit daunting considering some of these are well over a hundred years old, but they still do the job. And this is our friend the pup who has joined our tour. She's the official bodyguard. And she knows where the funiculars are located so she took the stairs instead. Hi, pup. You're sweet aren't you? Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. How was it? I survived. Hahaha. Hi, pup. Hello, friend. Hi, friend. Hi, friend. Hi, friend. Someone is busy filming. Yes, this is the kind of place if you're a photographer you do not put your camera down. No, not for one second. If we can offer one recommendation for visiting Valparaiso, it would be to join one of the free walking tours towards the beginning of your stay. This is a great way to get some background history and to familiarize yourself with the various neighbourhoods. The local guides know where to find the best murals, so consider this a scouting mission. You can always come back with a bit more time to explore the area with your camera in hand. Alright, so Sam we have been walking around Valparaiso for about an hour and a half or two hours. What are your first impressions so far? Well, my impressions are you should always give a place a second chance. Because where we were staying, on the flat part of the city, is a little boring. Not super exciting. A little boring for sure but once you get up on the hills it is a whole different city. Apparently, there are 42 hills in the city and we're just exploring it for the first time today. And my first impressions are so much better now that we're seeing this cool part. It is so colorful, so artsy and lots of fun to check out. Exactly. Another thing we really enjoyed about our walking tour of Valparaiso, was the company of all the dogs. Valparaiso has a lot of strays roaming the streets, but we found the dogs to be super friendly and affectionate. We also noticed locals feeding dogs in the park and homeowners leaving water bowls out on their doorstep for strays. As for all the dogs following us, our guide told us that the strays already know his routine and they are always there to meet him at various points along the walking tour. We had pack of 7 at one point during the tour. We're having a little food break. I think we're going to try some empanadas. And I see that they have shrimp ones on the menu. Shrimp and cheese empanadas so those should be really tasty. So snack time. Your first deep-fried Chilean empanada. And this one is stuffed with cheese and shrimp. Yes, cheese and shrimp. And this is my first time to ever try one with shrimp so this is an exciting moment. And they were cooked in oil. These were deep-fried so they're probably still a little bit hot. Oh, the cheese is so gooey. I have a nice big piece of shrimp too. This is honestly one of the best empanadas I've ever had. This is incredible. And we're been walking around for a long time. Yes, and I skipped breakfast so that may be a factor in what I'm saying here. Okay, let's get a closer look then. Let's see. Oh, ooey gooey but can we see the shrimp. Okay, it is kind of in there. Nice. Nice. So it is a little early in the morning but we're trying our first Chilean Pisco. Is it sour? Is the pisco sour? You know, it is a little sour but I mean it is also quite sweet. It is kind of nice. Like sugary and lemon-y. It is almost like a syrup. It is a little thick. Have some. So it is day two in Valparaiso and today we're going to do a bit more sightseeing. We're actually revisiting the area where we were yesterday because we didn't get enough pictures and video. Yes, and the light is fantastic this morning. Normally here it doesn't get sunny until like maybe four or five PM. And we have blue skies today. Hive five! So these are the famed piano steps and it doesn't look like it when you're going down but I'll show you as soon as I reach the bottom. Piano steps. Okay, so next up we're about to ride the oldest funicular around. This should be exciting. Yes, and this is how we've been getting around this part of town. Going up and down the funicular. Because otherwise it is really steep. Hopefully it won't be too rickety. This one is from 1883. So this one is definitely more rickety than the last one we rode. There goes the other one. So we weren't really planning on doing a boat tour today but we have blue skies, the weather is great and we finished our walking tour near the harbor. So why not? Yeah, why not. Let's do it. We hopped aboard, it is 3000 Chilean Pesos per person. It should give us a different perspective of the city that is for sure. Yeah, and it is going to be a thirty minute ride. So it should be fun. The harbor tours depart from Muelle Prat as soon as they get a boat-full of passengers. During the outing you’ll go past container ships, tug boats, and navy vessels, plus you’ll also have a guide on-board to point out sights along the way. If you’re lucky, you might even get to see some sea lions basking in the sun. So still catching my breath from the last hill we finished climbing. Right now we're visiting the neighborhood of Bella Vista. This is where the open-air museum is located. This is basically a collection of little streets and lanes with lots of street art and colorful murals. So we're going to be walking around and checking out the art. So it is day three and we kind of had a bit of a change in plans. We were originally planning to do another walking tour. Yep. But it is a really sunny day so decided to have a beach day instead. So we'll be taking the train over to Vina del Mar. Getting some seafood, some sunshine. So just mixing it up here and we were hoping to go this place before we left so I think we made the right decision hopefully. Viña del Mar is a super quick day trip from Valparaiso. The two cities are only 8 kilometers apart and you can easily get there with the above ground metro system that runs along the beach. It’s only a 15 minute ride, and it’s quite the change in scenery. Whereas Valparaiso is colorful, artsy, and gritty, Viña del Mar is a bit more chic and modern. That being said, while we enjoyed our day trip to Viña del Mar, we were really glad we decided to stay in Valparaiso as we felt it had way more character. Yes, are you cute pup? Are you cute? We made it to the beach. And we're soaking in some rays. It is still a little bit windy because it is early in the morning so I've got my scarf on. But I think the day is going to warm up. It is 25 degrees. There is no reason for you to have a scarf on right now. It is chilly. Just saying. Just saying. And yeah, it is kind of cool here. It is really different from Valparaiso. Lots of condos and hotels along the beach. Lots of seafood restaurants. Yeah, it couldn't be any different. You can tell this is kind of like maybe a popular weekend destination for people living in Santiago or nearby. It is less artsy and more upscale I would say. So our time in Valparaiso is coming to an end. What are your final thoughts of the place? Yeah, that is a wrap from here. I loved it here. It was one of the coolest cities that I think we've visited on this entire South America trip. Yeah. What was really unique for me, obviously was going up to the hills and seeing all of those artsy gritty neighborhoods. It is a city I've never been to before. Like I backpacked in 2010 and this is somewhere I didn't get to go to. Finally a new destination for Sam. Yes, a new place for me. A lot of these places on this trip haven't been new for me so this was a little bit extra special. And so I really loved it here and I would highly recommend you come. And the views are so cool. We have to show you the views from our balcony. Look at that. You get to see the hills, the colorful hills. Bye Valparaiso. After close to a month travelling around Chile, Sam and I hopped on a plane to visit Easter Island, known locally as Rapa Nui. This was the closest we were ever going to get to this remote speck in the ocean, which also happens to be the southeastern most point of the Polynesian Triangle. We gave ourselves one full week to explore Isla de Pascua, and what follows is a travel guide of our time there. We hiked ancient volcanoes, stood face to face with the moai, watched spectacular sunrises and sunsets, and road tripped around the island while wild horses ran alongside. It was an incredible week and we hope this video will inspire you to plan your own visit to Easter Island. DAY 1 So it is our first morning on Easter Island. How excited are you? Beyond excited. This is incredible. This is a place I never actually thought I was going to visit in my lifetime. And we're going to start off the day by climbing a volcano because why not. That's how we roll. Let's go. This is the beast we're planning on tackling. Right in front of us. That is an extinct volcano crater. Right ahead. We have dogs leading the way for us. Which way pups? Lead the way pups. We just witnessed an animals in the wild moment. We have two dogs who have been following us since we left the town and they've been walking along keeping us company. And then one of them saw a chicken and it decided that's going to be my breakfast and it just went for it. Caught a live chicken, the chicken died and the dog had breakfast. So, that is country living. Country living. That is what happens. (Dog panting) (Dogs lapping up water) Rano Kau is 324 meters tall and it is located on the southwestern tip of Rapa Nui. We hiked all the way from town, and because of it’s gradual incline, we found it to be a relatively easy activity. That being said, we would recommend doing it early in the morning, since there were very few shaded areas along the way. We made it to the top. Woo! Yes! I feel like we've earned it. There is ways you can cheat by taking the car. We could drive up to the top like a whole bunch of people have done but we were up early and we walked to get here. Feeling accomplished. The Rano Kau crater is a protected area so you are not allowed to climb into it, however, you can get some really cool views of the interior by standing along the rim. Here’s a little fun fact: because the crater is sheltered from the winds, it has developed its own micro-climate and it also has vegetation you can’t find elsewhere on the island. So we've reached the top of Orongo but the hike is not over yet. The trail continues and apparently we're going to get some really cool views of tiny little islands just off of Easter Island. Like little islets I guess you could say. So let's go. Let's go. Orongo is a village and ceremonial site located just past the Rano Kau Crater. Unfortunately, it started pouring rain shortly after we reached the site, so we didn’t get to visit, but we made plans to return later that week. That evening we made our way into Hanga Roa to watch the sun set from the harbor. There were lots of surfers out on the water, and the waves kept rolling in and crashing against the rocks. Meanwhile we enjoyed the show with ice cream cones in hand. DAY 2 So it is Sunday morning, 9AM right now, and we are going to Catholic Mass. This was a suggestion by our host who is renting us the cutest little cottage. She said this is mostly for tourists so I'm not really sure what to expect but we were a bit curious so we're going to go check it out. (Music, chanting and praying) So that was a pretty cool church service. It was unlike any I've ever been to before. It was pretty cool because a lot of the songs they sang were actually in Rapa Nui. It wasn't in Spanish. Um, and also just the clothes they were wearing. Like I don't really know the terminology for this but the Priest had like feathers on his head and some dogs made it in as well. Yeah, dogs came in to the service. Lots of music. We also had kind of like a lay, I don't know if they use that word here or if that just is in Hawaii. He had like a flower necklace he was wearing. So it was pretty cool. It was nice seeing the culture and how that is incorporated into the local church service. So, if you happen to be on the island, on a Sunday you can check that out. After attending mass, we hopped over to the artisan’s market located just across the street. Here we found all sorts of souvenirs, including: miniature moai statues carved out of stone and wood, as well as postcards, magnets, and jewelry. After the market we took a walk to Ahu Tahai, which is a ceremonial complex that holds 3 different ‘ahus’ or platforms with moai. Perhaps the most famed of the three is Ahu Ko Te Riku, which stands out from the rest because it has restored eyes. Having already visited Ahu Tahai by day, we still made it a point to come in the late afternoon. The complex is just a short walk to the north end of town, and it also happens to be the best place to catch the sunset on the island. From this spot you can watch the sun paint the sky all shades of persimmon, pink and gold, before finally setting behind the moai and then dipping beneath the ocean. Day 3 So day three on the island and look at what we just got. Our official Rapa Nui stamps. How cool are those? Very very cool. Best souvenir ever. So we just finished renting a car and that calls for a road-trip around Easter Island. So our first stop is Rano Raraku. I'm probably butchering the name but I think that is the sight you've been most excited to visit. Yeah, this is a place we've been really wanting to go to and I can't believe it took us until what day three. Day 3 to actually do it. But yeah, there are hundreds of Moai here. Many of them unfinished. A lot of them toppled over. So it is pretty cool to just walk around and see so many of them up close. Yes, and we've got the car for 48 hours so there is going to be a lot of road tripping left to do. Yes. Rano Raraku is yet another volcano crater found on the island, and it is also the site of the quarry that supplied the stone for the hundreds of moai that can be found on the island. The quarry is believed to have been in use for a span of 500 years up until the early 18th century when activity ceased. It would also appear that this site was abandoned in a rush since many of the moai here are unfinished. So right now we're heading inside the crater of the Ranu Raraku volcano. And there is a lake in there. It basically looks like a wetland. It is pretty cool. Quite green. So yeah, have a look. If you can see. There it is. And there is Sam filming in the background. Awesome. After seeing the moai scattered on the slopes of the volcano, we took a little detour and hiked into the crater. This area is home to a lake with reeds. We also spotted wild horses and a few moai inside the crater, which was quite unexpected. From there we continued on to Ahu Tongariki for a quick visit. This site is home to 15 moai, making it the biggest ‘ahu’ on the island. Okay so it is almost sunset and we're driving back to a spot that we've already been to before and that is Orongo. And we're going to get some nice views of the crater from there and I think sunset should be pretty spectacular. We'll be looking out at the ocean. Woo hoo. Day 4 Well good morning. It is day four on Easter Island. Sam how are you feeling? Grumpy? Did you sleep well? Grumpy, a little bit tired still. But we're up for a very special reason. Yes, we're here to watch the sunrise. So we drove back to the 15 Moai where we were yesterday. And it should be pretty spectacular. The sun is starting to break-through so we're going to show you that. The best place to catch the sunrise in Rapa Nui is at Ahu Tongariki. We made the drive in the dark and we arrived just as the sky was beginning to show its soft morning colours. It’s also worth noting that when we visited in March, sunrise was happening at 8:20 a.m., so we weren’t up that early. So we are back on the road. We freshened up, had our breakfast and right now we're visiting Ahu Akivi. And these are the only Moai on the whole island that lookout to sea. So that is pretty unusual. So it is not the best time of day for light but hopefully you can see them just over there. There is seven of them here. We keep coming across wild horses. Right behind me. So cool. (Airplane noises) It is time for ceviche. It is actually like three or four in the afternoon but we're hungry and we love this place. It is our favorite spot on the island. So let's go in. Making new friends. I think the pup wants ceviche. It is waiting for our order to arrive. Don't you. Yes, you like your fish. You like your fish. Can you see all of this? Our ceviche has arrived. This one is Sam's and looks like his has shrimp. Mine is strictly local fish. Catch of the day. I couldn't tell you what the name of the fish is but it looks amazing. We've got rice, sweet potatoes, salad. Let's dig in. That's good. I just love the lime and the cilantro that they've put on this. It is amazing. My favorite. So that was a pretty fabulous meal, wouldn't you say? Yes, we're full. But never too full for ice cream. Waiting for your cone. Three scoops. Three scoops. I would like to point out that Sam ran off with his ice cream and he left me to pay for everything. And this is probably our favorite spot to eat. They have awesome artisan ice cream. Uh-huh. And it is really good value. Like it is not expensive and the taste is amazing. Absolutely amazing. Do you know what flavors your are having here? You've got three flavors. I've got mint, I've got Malpaga. Malaga which is like rum and raisin. And the other one was Torrone something. I can't remember what that is. It had hazelnuts in it. You're having a hard time keeping the camera up. You're so excited to eat yours. I'm having a raspberry ginger. And I better start eating because it is melting. One of the best decisions we made on our trip was to rent a car so that we would have the ability to explore all of Easter Island. On one particular afternoon, we hopped in the car and decided to drive the full island loop. We got to enjoy landscapes, the waves crashing along the rocky shores, and we also encountered many wild horses! If was one of the highlights of our visit. So we are finishing off the day with a trip to Anakena beach. And Sam just loves the beach. So we had to come here. Yeah, I love it so much we're coming tomorrow. Just for her. Day 5 Meow. Good morning. It is day 5 on Easter Island and it is actually our last day with a car so we're trying to make the most of everything. So, back at the beach. First up, back at the beach. Yes, back at Anakena Beach. We were here yesterday but we thought we'd come and get some pictures. And next up we're going to head back to the Orongo Crater. Or no, to Orongo village because last time we were there it started pouring rain and we had to run back. So we didn't get to see much over there. So we'll be driving there next up. Fingers crossed for better weather. Mmmhmmm. So next up we're visiting Puna Pao and this is where the Pukao were carved. And those are the red stones that you see on top of a lot of the Moai. And they are not sure if these were meant to resemble top knots, turbans or hats. But you can see them off in the distance. Puna Pao is a quarry with red volcanic rock, and although it is much smaller than Rano Raraku, all of the headpieces that you see on the ‘moai’ across the island came from this very spot. Later in the day we finally made it back to Orongo, where the rain held up! The village consists of round-walled buildings made out of flat stone, and there’s a trail that winds through the entire village. So it is nighttime here in Hanga Roa, Easter Island. And this evening we're going to a cultural dance performance. It should be fun. Let's go check it out. (Singing and dancing) Day 6 And now it is time for a tour of our little cottage here on Easter Island. Yeah, this is our last day here and we thought we'd just show you the house. We've had a really low-key day. I mean it has been awesome. We've been able to have such good weather on this island. And we've like covered basically everything we wanted to do so this last day we've really done basically nothing. Well, it was pouring rain this morning. It was. We couldn't go anywhere. I mean, that is part of the luck we've had though. We haven't had rain except for on the day we didn't need to do anything. Alright, so time for the house tour. Lead the way, sir. Up the steps. So this is a kind of basic accommodation you can find on the island. This feels like house hunters international. Living room. Here is the living room. Yes, followed by the kitchen. The dining area. Here we have the kitchen which is a little messy at the moment. And our messy humble abode. This is the bedroom we've been staying in. So yeah, the beds. We've been staying here with my parents and they have a room over there. The fancy room. And we also have a little bathroom. Tada! Hello! Um, yeah. So accommodations on Easter Island are very basic and a little pricey. For this cottage we paid 830 US dollars for the week. Yeah. And that is pretty standard. Yeah, exactly. So if you come here, if you don't have a huge budget this is the type of place you're likely going to be staying at. Yeah. Day 7 Ciao Rapa Nui! Ciao. So sad! First class. But we never get to sit in first class. And just like that our week on Easter Island was up! Rapa Nui is one of the most fascinating places we have ever visited, and we loved getting to explore every inch of the island. Now it’s over to you. Have you been to Easter Island? Is it a place you’d like to visit? Let us know in the comments below. Good afternoon from the town of San Pedro de Atacama in Chile. We've been here a few days taking a few different day trips to visit volcanoes and lagoons and see flamingos and doing lots of cool stuff. We've seen lots of wildlife, we've seen some amazing landscapes. And now we're going to show you the town. It's actually quite small and there isn't a lot to do but if you're taking tours from here you're going to end up spending a bit of time in San Pedro so yeah let's go take a little tour. A little walk around. Sounds good to me. Bienvenidos a San Pedro de Atacama. Si! And this place is pretty cool because in the distance, in the background you can see volcanoes. You have volcanoes right over there. Let me run out to the street. There. So next up we're going to take you down a street called Caracoles. And this is like the main street in the whole town. This is where you can find ice cream shops, bars, restaurants, tour operators, laundry places. Whatever you could need and that is over this way. This way. This way. Come. What are your overall impressions of the town after having spent a few days here? Yeah, it's a decent place to hang out. This is not the kind of town where you come to linger. It's a launching pad for a whole bunch of other activities. You can also go to Bolivia to do the Uyuni salt flat tours as well. And you can also cross over to Argentina to go to Salta which is what we're going to do tomorrow. Yeah, so come here book a tour, take some trips and eat well. Yes. And our last stop of this little tour of San Pedro is the main square. Yes. This is where you'll find live music and lot of dogs running around. Yeah, some live music is happening as we speak. And that is a wrap from San Pedro. We are now finishing things off with a few clips from Carnival because 'yes' we're in the thick of carnival season. Ciao. Ciao ciao. Good morning everyone. Today you'll notice I'm not traveling with Audrey or my parents. Yesterday we did a marathon session of 13 hours of tours. So understandably they are back at home resting. But today I'm going to go out and show some different areas in and around San Pedro de Atacama. And these are different from what we did before. We're going to be focusing on lagoons and the altiplano and we're also going to be visiting a Salt Flat. So lots of cool stuff planned for today. Something else I've really enjoyed about the tours here is the fact they've all left really early in the morning. That's been awesome for photography because of the nice soft light in the morning and also great for spotting wildlife. Ah, estoy llena. Breakfast was awesome. I'm totally stuffed. Today we had omelettes and we also had bread and we had Carlitos again so it was a really good meal and now we're ready to move on. On both days of our tour we decided to go with a company called Grado diez - Grado 10. And I thought I'd share the thought process behind that. So number one the vehicles are a lot bigger than the typical ones plying these roads. A lot of the vehicles that you'll see on these tours are little minivans and they tend to have problems sometimes on these off-roads. So taking a big truck was really good. And the other reason we decided to go with this company too was because of the awesome windows on this vehicle. This is like a safari truck so you know the tour cost a little bit more and we did get a few extra things. Like we had a really nice breakfast, we had on the first day we had pancakes, we had really nice juice, coffee, bread. And today we had omelets. I've noticed on other cheaper tours you get a lot more of a simple breakfast. It is just like bread and maybe juice and that is it. So this was a really good choice for us. It cost a little bit more but you know sometimes the extra comfort is worth paying for. Next up is the flamingo reserve. Time to go spot some flamingos. Something about the tour today to really keep in mind is that the elevation does go above 4000 meters above sea level. So that means that altitude sickness can be an issue and also getting a sunburn is very common in this type of weather because you're up so high, so you really really need to slather on that sunscreen. Alright, so that marks the end of the tour. The highlight was definitely the flamingo reserve and the salt flats. Well the temperature sure changes quickly here in the Atacama desert. When we went to visit the geysers this morning we were freezing. It was so cold and this afternoon we're planning to tour the Valley of the Moon and we are melting. Like seriously, it must be like high 30's maybe even low 40's in Celsius. I feel like it's Samuel a la parrilla. His first Spanish joke - Sam on the grill. Haha! So our first stop on this afternoon tour is called Piedra del Coyote and our guide was saying this was like the iconic postcard shot that you see on all of the guidebooks and it is pretty impressive. Voila! Into the deep dark cave. Actually it is not very big and it is very deep or very dark but it is a lot cooler than out in the desert. So, I'm happy. This is a time where I wish I was 5'6 not 6'1. This is spooky. We're only seeing shadows. And darkness. We should have brought a flashlight. Should have brought a flashlight. We're like little ants in a tunnel. Yes, except that I'm an ant that is way too big for this little ant tunnel. The Queen ant. I'm the queen ant. I should be out enjoying paradise somewhere else. That was kind of hard to film. We weren't expecting to crawl through a tunnel. Yeah, it started off too easy. And we're like this isn't even a cave. And then it became hardcore caving. And it was pitch black and we didn't bring flashlights. But the best part about this was that it allowed us to cool off. It was so hot before we came in here. The end is nigh. The end is nigh. No, seriously though. This is our final stop. We have to climb a dune or some hill. It is going to take us about 30 minutes. Once we reach the top we get to watch the sunset. Woo! And then we get food back in town. Feed me. Yes, and what you don't realize is this is our second tour of the day. This is going to be our second video coming out but we did all of this in one day. We started at four AM and right now it is what? Sunset, sunset time. Let's go watch the sun. And that is a wrap for our Valle de la Luna tour. We are tired, hungry and ready to get a rest. Ciao! Well, somebody looks all bundled up this morning. I know. Good morning from the chilly Atacama desert. Yesterday, we arrived in San Pedro de Atacama and we booked a tour to visit El Tatio geysers and we had to be up at four in the morning. It was a really early start and now it is probably around seven but it is still freezing but I'm told we're going to get chocolate pancakes plus we're going to see some pretty cool geysers so it should be a really fun outing. I think you're holding out for the pancakes. Pancakes. So apparently this it he highest geyser field in the whole world. And according to my Lonely Planet there should be around 64 geysers although our guide did mention there is closer to 80. So who knows maybe there are new ones sprouting up. And you look ridiculous with your blanket which you stole from the vehicle. Stolen blanket. Stolen blanket alert. It is so cold. Okay, yesterday when we booked the tour we were told it might be close to like zero degrees. Maybe even 10 below but I didn't believe it because it was so hot in the town. So I'm wearing leggings and I have an alpaca sweater and a wind-breaker but it is not enough. It is not enough. I want to jump in one of the geysers. They look really warm. You go do that. Okay. Well, well so this is not your first visit here Sam. So, can you tell us how does it compare coming back a second time. Well, my first time I came here I was incredibly dunce. Okay, I came wearing shorts and I didn't even have a sweater on. I thought I was going to die of hypothermia. So this time I am more well prepared but even so my hands and still cold. Let's see. Outfit of the day. Sweat pants, I got my alpaca sweater, I've got my jacket and I've got my mitts. So kind of toasty. Sort of kind of. Relatively kind of compared to last time. Yes, very toasty compared to last time. It is not really like hot but it is nice. Hahaha. So what are you doing Sam? I'm warming up my frozen fingers. Mmmm. Urrggghhh. So this is our sweet ride in the background. Yes, this kind of reminds me of something kind of like a hybrid safari vehicle in Africa and something we'd take up to Churchill Manitoba to look at polar bears. Yes, it is kind of like a monster truck but for tourists. So how is it? It is so nice and warm. This has been the most relaxing part of the trip so far. I do not want to leave. Although breakfast is tempting me. Chocolate pancakes. Chocolate pancakes. Breakfast is soon to be served. We have some cake and dulce de leche and tea and coffee and juice and the pancakes are being made and there is cheese. So it should be tasty. Yes, please. I'm hungry. Cheese, yes please. Tell us about that delicious breakfast we just polished off. Breakfast was awesome. It was worth the wait. I don't think we ate until around nine thirty so we were hungry. Like we started this tour at four in the morning. So five and a half hours before food. So what did we have? The highlight was by far the pancakes with dulce de leche. Yes, and we had grilled sandwiches with ham and cheese. They've like Carlitos. Yes, and cake and what else? Tea, orange juice, coffee, so we're well fed and ready to hit the road again. Yeah. So now we have twenty minutes stop in a village called Machuca. And there is a new part and an old part to the village. The older construction is over a thousand years old so we are going to go find some of those ruins. There is some churches out here as well. But apparently the civilization has been here for over eight thousand years so that is a long time. That's impressive. Oh look at you. Look at you so sweet. So sweet. Look at those little eyes. Oh. We can get some pretty cool snacks in this town. Tell me all about it. Yes, if you're in the mood for a tasty treat there is meat back there and it is not just any kind of meat. It is alpaca skewers barbecued right behind me. Yum yum are you going to get some? You know what, normally I would but I'm so full from that pancake breakfast. I had over 4 pancakes. Four and a half actually. Woah, the truth comes out. The truth revealed. You're a flamingo today aren't you? I'm waddling like one too. Actually flamingos don't waddle. But the cherry on top of the cake here for this tour was getting to see flamingos. I was think you know what maybe we're not going to get to see them but right at the last stop yes we get to. And we're now at our final stop of the tour. We're checking out this really cool gorge that is really green and yeah it has been an awesome tour. We saw some amazing landscapes, lots of wildlife. We ate some tasty pancakes. So yeah, if you're ever traveling around Atacama this is a really fun tour to take. Well good morning. As you can probably tell from the sunglasses and t-shirt we have left Bolivia and we are back to much warmer weather. Yesterday, we crossed over to Chile and we are visiting Arica. Which is actually a border city which sits between Chile and Peru right at the very top. So yeah, we're right by the beach, warmer weather and yeah today we're going to go out and explore. So we should probably tell the story of how we got to Arica. Ha, yeah. It was a pretty good one involved in that. First off, we'll say that that bus ride was one of the most scenic we've ever been on. Absolutely incredible coming from La Paz to Arica in terms of going from a high altitude destination all the way down to sea level. Yes, it was supposed to take about 7 or 8 hours. Yeah. And it took over 15. Almost six hours at immigration. It was probably honestly the biggest gong show of an immigration I've ever seen. They had one immigration officer processing all of the people on the bus, so they were literally hundreds of people in line. And yet they had other immigration officers like sometimes two or three just checking out one car. Like it just totally didn't make sense. And there had just been a strike in Bolivia a few days ago so they had just opened the border and there were hundreds of people who wanted to get across because they had been waiting for days. Yeah, but anyways part of the adventure so we arrived last night exhausted but now we've had a good night's sleep and we're excited to explore Arica. Yes, the city looks great. So one of the coolest things about arriving in a city and having no plans is that you just encounter all of these random things. And there appears to be a market setting up right now. Yeah, it is still a bit early. About eight in the morning or so. So it is just getting started but I think it is going to get busy later on today. So this looks to be like a vintage market where they're selling used clothing. Although I did see some booths that were selling plants and teddy bears so I guess you can find a little bit of everything here. And it looks like we've come across yet another market. This one is more like a farmer's market so they are selling fresh produce. Let's go through. So we went to the farmer's market and you walked away with a piece of electronics. Yes, so every country has different electrical power outlets. Uh-huh. But Chile takes the prize for having one of the strangest. Check this out. That's three prongs. Three skinny little prongs. Yeah. So we were having trouble plugging in this morning so this was a really timely find. For under a dollar. We are at the bus terminal buying tickets for our next destination. Want to tell us where we're going? Yes. San Pedro de Atacama. And what is funny is we went to a bus company called Atacama and they do not go to Atacama. We had to find another one. Which bus did we go with? Ah, I think Tour. Tour something. Tour something? I forget but we have tickets. We've got our tickets. We're going. That is the main thing. Night bus. Yes. Cocina Peruana. So as you can probably tell from the sign we are having Peruvian food in Chile. But don't worry. We are planning to eat Chilean food while we're here. It is just you know Peru is so close and we love Ceviche and we've found this restaurant so we had to go in. And Aji de Gallina. Yes, let's go in. So tell me about that fantastic meal. That seriously was fantastic. I don't give a lot of restaurants an A plus but I do for this one. Authentic Peruvian food done at a high level. And that is a wrap for Arica. We didn't make it to the beach. No, or any museums. Or any major landmarks as a matter of fact. But I mean that what our stop here was all about. Just resting, buying tickets to San Pedro. Yeah, and we got to see flea markets and some other things. We had good food and that is all we really wanted to experience. Now we're on to a new destination. Yeah, so great impressions from the city. We would definitely recommend it as pit stop. And yeah, Arica was fun.",False,"20170410 - Visit Chile Travel Guide ≡ƒç¿≡ƒç▒Best Things to Do in Santiago, Valparaiso, Easter Island & Atacama Desert.en.srt"

So instead today we're going to be trying some traditional food from Cusco. So we've placed our order and we're waiting for our food to arrive. I'm not entirely sure what to expect because I've never really tried food from this region. We've been eating light meals since we got to Cuzco just because we're trying to deal with the altitude sickness, so yeah, this is our first day that we're ready for our big hearty meal. So until the meal arrives you've got some nice bread rolls in your hand. Yeah, these were freshly baked in the oven and can't wait to try them. We have two different kinds of spicy sauces. They're both called 'aji' sauces, so let's take a look down here and we're going to dunk it in. Actually there is spoons so I can do it a little more civilized I suppose. And I will put a little bit of red and a bit of green. Why not. Let's try that. Mmmm. Is that burning your mouth? Is your mouth on fire at the moment? Yeah, I'm tasting more of the sauce than the bread. But the bread is good. It is melting in my mouth. And it was made in the oven right behind you. Right over there. Right over there. Fancy. So my meal has arrived. I ordered a soup and I'm having something called Chayro wsqueño and if you have a look down over here it is basically a soup with lamb and Andean greens. I'm not sure what kind of greens those would be. It kind of looks like barley. Um, there might be some Quinoa in there. I don't really know but it is really hearty and you can see it has potatoes and carrots and celery and it looks really really good. So let's try it. Mmmm. Oh. Wow! That's like a nice thick flavorful soup. Um, I can't really tell what these little green leaves are. I wonder if it is parsley or cilantro. Mmmm. But it is really nice. I like that is has a really thick texture because of the potato that breaks apart and you obviously have the grains and the meat. I still haven't tried the meat. Here is my lamb. So yeah, that is really nice. It's the kind of dish you want to order on a really cold day to warm you up. And I like that it is served in a nice cute little bowl that you can warm up your hands. I'm a little bit chilly in case you can't tell. So yeah, good soup. And you ordered something called Pachapapa and we're not entirely sure if that is a name that the restaurant gave to the meal or if that is really what the meal is called in this part of Peru. Yeah, we have no idea we just came to this restaurant, ordered it on a whim and so what I'm thrilled about is that if we take a look at our my plate is that I've got a lot of different stuff going on. I've got a salad, I've got the meat, I've got the tamale, I've got potatoes covered in cheese and I have some kind of stuffed pepper. But being the carnivore that I am I think I will try the meat first. And can you tell us what kind of meat this is? Because it is not beef. Yeah, it is Alpaca meat. Alpaca? Indeed! So pretty special. Dig in. I've never tried Alpaca before. Does it taste like beef? Chicken or fish? It tastes something like of in between chicken and beef. This particular cut is really tender and it has a lot of seasonings on it so it is quite good. It's not as game-y as I thought it would be. Alright, time to try my tamale. And the tamale is made with corn. Mmmm. Yellow corn. That's one of the best tamales I've ever had. I think it's got cheese. Yeah, it's got cheese in there. Mmmm. Oh, my. I have food envy all of a sudden. That is so good. You better hope I share with you. Okay, so my kind husband is willing to share this stuffed pepper which I was told has beef and vegetables and melted cheese on top. So let's take a good chunk since he's in the mood to share. It's not so much I'm in the mood to share. I'm just not sure I can eat it all myself. Mmmmm. That's like ground beef and man that is actually spicy. My tongue is on fire right now. But it is tasty obviously because I'm still chewing. But yeah, nice. I like that you have a very full plate and you get to sample a little bit of everything. So we tried to make this as authentic of a meal in Cusco as we possibly could, so I got my Cusqueña beer. And tomorrow we're going to try and find Cuy. #eatPERU So for today's lunch in Lima we are going to be having Chifa. And that is basically Chinese food with a Peruvian twist. So you know how we always visit a country maybe even Canada or the US and you go to a Chinese buffet and you're like mmmm this is delicious and then you go to China and you can't find any of the dishes you had at a Chinese buffet. That is because Chinese food really varies from one country to the next because incorporate you know their spices and their cooking styles. So Peruvian Chinese food is quite distinct. We're going to be eating Chifa which literally means to eat rice. So yeah, we've ordered a lot of food that is going to be coming soon and it should be interesting. Peruvian Chinese food. So our appetizers have arrived. They sure have. And I'm just dividing up the wanton soup. We got chicken wontons. Actually no, we have pieces of chicken here. I'm not sure what is inside the wantans. That is going to be a surprise. So it is chicken plus wontons. Yeah, we're sharing because we ordered a lot of food and I have a feeling I may not be able to finish all of this myself. Oh, and it just keeps on arriving. This is just appetizers. Okay, so Sam is going to begin with the wanton soup over there. Yes, and if there is one dish that we always tend to order when we get Chinese food, basically anywhere in the world, if wanton soup is on the menu we're ordering it. So I can't wait to try this. These are huge wantons. That is a huge noodle. It is like spilling over the spoon. Yeah. Don't burn yourself. Mmmm. Yeah, that is a good wanton. Yeah, I'm guessing the filling might have some pork and a little bit of vegetables inside of it. Yeah, and the soup has lots of slices of chicken. Yes, want to show us those? Check out this. Big slices of chicken too. This is going to be a good meal. So I'm still working on my wanton soup. And as you can probably tell I added lots of soy sauce to make it a little bit more salty. And another cool thing, I've never had wanton soup with cabbage. This has some big leafy cabbage in here. Show us some of that cabbage. Oh wow. I'm trying to lift it in my spoon. Look at all of that. Massive. Yeah. So time for appetizers. Yes, so I am trying the deep-fried spring rolls. And these come with a unique, I think this is kind of like a lemon sauce. Yeah. And what is pretty cool about these is that they have chicken and vegetables inside. So let's try them. Mmmm. Wow! I've never had spring rolls with a lemon sauce and I have to say I like it even more than a soy or a plum sauce. This is really really adds a lot of tang and sourness to it. And what is awesome about these is that you can tell they've been like freshly made. Like they are so crispy, pipping hot and they're just amazing. This is really really tasty. And let's see. What else do we have here. What are these? Because if our wanton soup wasn't enough we also got deep-fried wantons. Yeah. And this comes in a red sauce and this is much thicker. That is going to be a little bit sweet and sour. So crispy. Mmmm. So crispy. So good. And that sauce really makes it. And I can taste the beef in here too. Yum. Yum. Yum. So we are now making our way over to the mains. Yes, this is called Chancho Cruyoc or as we call it in English sweet and sour breaded pork. And this was the must have dish that I insisted on us ordering. Yeah, so basically it comes in a sweet and sour sauce. The pork has been breaded and what is unique about this one here is that yes it sometimes comes with pineapple but over at this restaurant it comes with peach as well. So I've got a piece of pineapple and peach. And look at the sesame seeds on that. Alright, time to try that. So I'm trying that with peach. That's awesome. That is one of my favorite Chinese dishes anywhere in the world. They do it really well here in Peru Chifa style. It is just so sweet, so sour and then to have that extra bit of fruit added really adds an extra element of juiciness. Just delicious. Okay, next up we've got a breaded chicken dish. What is that one called? So this one is Chi Jau Kay. And I'm starting to get full already but we're just starting on the mains so making room. A big piece. Mmmmm. Okay. Yeah, so it is like breaded chicken kind of like with a chop suey sauce. It is very light it doesn't have a strong flavor and it is kind of a thicker sauce as well. And I do like it. You can really taste the chicken. The fried breaded chicken. So yeah, I think this is the type of dish that works for most people. You know, easy to like. If you like fried chicken you're probably going to like this. So next up. And no Chifa meal would be complete without fried rice. So we have something called chaufa de pollo. And here is the pollo. You can see the pieces of chicken. Mmmmmm. That is good. Yeah? Oh, yeah. You can really taste the chicken. There is also a bit of fried egg and a little bit of spring onions cut up in there too. Let's have a closer look at that. So, yeah, you can see all of the ingredients in there. And it is really nice having this rice because you can like put it on to your plate and then if you're adding these other dishes it helps like sop up the sauce and that is my favorite part. And of course no meal at a Chinese restaurant would be complete without a pot of tea to help you digest all of it. Mmmmm. That is Jasmine tea. I just asked for tea. I didn't specify but this is great. That is awesome. Because you know Chinese food and Chifa tends to be quite greasy. Yes. And this really helps to aid with the digestion. Alright, so what did you think of Chifa? Chinese food in Peru. Absolutely loved it. Love Chinese Peruvian food. I think it is some of the best Chinese food I've ever had anywhere. And it just has a very strong influence. There was a lot of Chinese immigrants who came from the province of Guangdong and they brought their cuisine over here. And over time it has become a fusion cuisine with Peruvian influences. So I absolutely love it. And here is a fun fact. In Lima alone there is over 6000 Chifa restaurants. So anywhere you are in this city you can get Chifa. Obviously, one of the best places to get Chifa is Chinatown but you can be anywhere in the city. We're having our meal here in Miraflores. So you can be anywhere in Lima and you can find yourself some awesome authentic Chinese Peruvian food. Mmmm. And you know what I think the food beat us. We may have ordered a bit too much. Oh yeah, we still have some leftover. We're going to have some dinner. Some dinner to take home. So it is now time for price point. How much was all that food? Yeah, so that came to 101 Soles. So, not the cheapest meal but when you consider how much we ordered and that we're basically taking home our dinner not too bad of a value. That was still under $30 US dollars for all of that food. And what we're going to do is since because we ordered so much food we are going to put the description of the food right at the end of this video. We'll see you for the next time. And here is our takeout. Our takeaway. See you next time for another Peruvian food video. #eatPERU So if this place looks familiar it is because we've made a video here once before. And to be honest we come to this restaurant pretty often whenever we're in Lima. This place is called Punto Azul and they make a delicious ceviche and some pretty tasty dishes that we're going to be sampling today. We're actually ordering all of our favorite dishes at this restaurant, so it should be a tasty meal. So as Audrey mentioned we're going all out. We're getting literally everything we want here, so we've got Chicha Morada in a vase. That is enough for the two of us. That is the purple corn drink. Yes. Yeah. It is delicious, refreshing, sweet and then my favorite, my personal favorite beer in Peru Cusqueña. And I was drinking that quite a bit in Cusco earlier on in the year. And it is nice to be back in Lima and having a nice ice cold Cusqueña again. So this right here is Canchita. And it is a nice little snack you can enjoy before your meal. Look at the size of your kernels. They are pretty massive. Nice and crispy. Good stuff. Mmmmm. I'm also drinking my Chicha. I added a little bit of lime so it is nice and sour. So we're starting with an appetizer and today we're having Conchitas a la parmesana. Take a look over here. And just look at this thing of beauty. Oh la lah. Those are so good. And they are served in their shell. That is pretty cool. And lots of Parmesan cheese on there. We just squeezed on a little bit of lime. There we go. All in one bite. Mmmmm. That is so good. The scallop is super tender and the cheese - an explosion in your mouth. So I don't know if you remember this Audrey but it was actually your Grandma who introduced us to this dish here. Yes, she was the one who ordered this appetizer for the two of us and my parents a few months ago. So we've become big fans. Big fans of scallops. Mmmmm. The scallops is so juicy and yet when you have that salty like thick melted cheese over top. It is just amazing. Like this is just such a tasty appetizer. So I ordered the exact same thing every time I come to Punto Azul. Cebiche. And that has just arrived over here. This is just the classic ceviche. It is only fish, no other seafood in there and we've got our red onions. I also asked for it spicy so you can see the red peppers here. It has kind of been crushed. You still get some big chunks. Um, you have your sweet potato, fresh corn and of course the tiger's milk. Which is basically like a lemon base that helps cure the fish. So yeah, this is my absolute favorite. I never get sick of ceviche. My mouth just waters thinking about it. Oh my gosh. So let's dig in. Let's try it. Let's grab some onions in there as well. It is just so good. Wow. I just love all of the flavors in your mouth. Like it is so sour and tart but then you've got your sweet potato to kind of help balance that. It is just perfection. The perfect meal in Lima. Hands down my favorite Peruvian dish. Love it. And now it is time for your favorite. Yes, and you can't come Punto Azul and not indulge in the seafood but I'm trying something that is kind of unique to here and that is the shrimp cheese risotto. Guys, this is to die for. Look at that. Look at how cheesy that is. I'm grabbing a nice big shrimp here. It is so creamy. It is so creamy. This rivals the risottos you find in Italy. I kid you not. Watch it Italy. Mmmmmm. It is just so so so cheesy and then you have the shrimp and then you have all of the different seasonings. Like to me this is my favorite dish in Lima right now. I don't think you got a shrimp. Let's grab one. Yes, I did but I'm going to get a bigger one this time. Mmmmm. Awesome. Now let's talk about this cheesy thing you've got going on over here. Yeah, it is just a big chunk of hardened cheese. Are you using it as a cracker? Yeah, I'm using it as a cracker. It is basically just shredded golden crispy cheese. Oh, that is good. So I finished all my ceviche and Sam has taken over my plate. Can you tell us why? I'm in charge of finishing up the tiger's milk. The leche de tigre. And that is not a bad job to have. We are stuffed but we couldn't resist getting dessert. So if we have a look over here we are having a merengado de chirimoya. So this is the meringue you see right here. This brown sauce is manjar blanco which is similar to dulce de leche. It is kind of like a caramel. And then the chirimoya is a fruit. It is a white fleshy fruit which is completely covered in whipped cream and manjar blanco. So it is kind of hard to see it. But it is absolutely delicious. This is one of my favorite Peruvian desserts. Oooh. Look at that. That is so good. Like the fruit has very soft and subtle flavor. It is not overpowering. It is just fleshy and kind of apple-y and sweet but not too sweet. So you mostly just taste the manjar blanco and the sugar in the meringue. And I'll admit it is a bit of an odd consistency and it doesn't look the most appetizing once you've dug into the cup but it is a really good dessert. You really should try it when you're in Lima. So was that a satisfying meal or what? Oh man, that epic feast finally ended. Hahaha. And now it is time for price point so that came to just under 140 Soles. So that was less than $40 US dollars. And that included our Chicha Morada, our beer, our appetizer, our two mains and a dessert so not bad value. And if there is a tip I want to tell you it is to come to this restaurant early. If we had of gone 30 minutes later we would have been waiting outside with about twenty or thirty others. #eatPERU So for today's meal we are going to be trying something that is called Lomo saltado. This is often translated as jumping steak but really it is a stir fried steak and it is one of the most traditional dishes you can find just about anywhere in Peru. So yeah, we're going to be sampling that. We're actually sharing the plate. I hope it is a big portion because we've been walking around for a long time. We're pretty tired and we're hungry. So are you feeling more tired, more hungry or just plain hangry? Ah, all of the above. Hahaha. So today is one of those days that just isn't going the way that we had anticipated. So we ended up walking to a restaurant that specialized in Rocoto Relleno but it was closed. Yes. We researched this on Google but we didn't realize that the restaurant had just changed its hours to a different season. Yeah, so that was really disappointing. Yeah. Especially because we walked like 45 minutes in the heat. Yes, but anyways we're trying to salvage the situation. We just found this place, we walked down a busy street and we're thinking like yeah why not let's go film a Lomo saltado video. We haven't filmed this yet so here we are. So the food is here. Yeah, you know what? Put food in front of me and my mood can change instantly. Feeling a lot better, eh? Feeling a lot better suddenly. So let's take a tour of the plate here. And we'll show you what we have. So basically this is the sirloin steak strips here. So you can see that and this is entirely a stir fry. You have your onion, which is very typical as well. Red onions. And then you also have your peppers and your tomatoes as well. Oh, that looks good. And it is typically served with french fries and also rice. So it looks like we've got everything in the classic Lomo saltado. Now it is time to dig in. Alright, hungry boy, get to it. So I'm going to grab a piece of meat, I'm going to grab an onion and a french fry. If I can. It is going to be a big bite. It is a big bite. Whoops. There we go. Yeah? Yeah, that is tasty. I'm a really big fan of stir fries just in general, so this is an awesome food. This is one of the most popular foods in all of Peru and you can see why. It is just delicious, it is easy to prepare and it tastes really great. So even though this is considered to be a Peruvian dish it actually has Chifa origins. And that means it has Chinese roots so it is kind of like a fusion between Chinese food and Peruvian food. And if you look down here we have the beef and this is marinated in vinegar, soy sauce and spices so you can see the Chinese influence there. It is super tasty. Yeah, the other cool thing that we read was that it was cooked in a wok. Yeah. And the other Chinese influence is that it comes with rice. But the Peruvian influence is that it comes with, of course, the potatoes. They've got like thousands of potatoes in this country. Yes. So many different varieties. So it really is the ultimate fusion dish. Mmmmmm. Do you like it? Really good. Okay, so now it is time for price point. Yes, so this was 16 Soles. So less than 5 US dollars. And it was enough for the two of us to share so pretty good value. And something that is really cool about Lima, and I've only seen this in a few cities around the world such as like New York and what is really cool about Lima is that you can kind of just pop into any restaurant and get a decent meal. Like Lima is such a foodie city that you could not be in business, you could not have a restaurant if you didn't serve at least something decent. So we winged this video, we came in and grabbed Lomo saltado in a restaurant we've never had before and yet we had a really good meal. So, that is kind of the Lima eating experience. The classic Lima eating experience. You go out, you order something and it tends to be good most of the time. #eatPERU So it is time for another lunch video here in Lima. Today we're filming downtown. So we popped into one of the few restaurants that was willing to serve us lunch at eleven am because we're already starved and you know when we're hungry we get hangry. So here we are, we're going to be filming a video about ocopa a la arequipeña and Papa a la Huancaína. Both are potato dishes served with sauces which are kind of similar but from different regions. So we'll be sampling those. So well I'm sipping on my purple corn juice known as Chicha Morada Sam is having beer. Yes, I'm having a beer. And I'm mixing things up today by getting a Cristal. Normally I have Cusqueña but I thought why not try. Only half a glass? Yes, and I like it foamy. Foamy. Really? Or you just don't know how to pour it? That's the question. Maybe a bit of both. No I'm just kidding. No, I do know how to pour it. And that is decent beer. Yeah. Better than Cusqueña? No, but it is still good. So Sam is going to be trying Papa a la Huancaina. Oh yeah. And that looks fabulous. And I'm getting some extra sauce put on top here. Because you can never have too much of that. Just one potato? You're only grabbing one potato. Well there is three so I thought I might share with you. Oh, how caring. Maybe. Maybe. Okay. So the dish Sam is trying, Papa a la Huancaína, originated in the province of huancayo and that is how it gets its name. Yeah, so let's talk about the ingredients here. So the main thing here is the sauce. I mean of course this is a potato dish but this is a sauce that is made out of cheese, milk and rocoto. And rocoto that is the yellow aji pepper. Yeah, exactly. And this is something we're very familiar with because it is often served at your Aunt's and Grandma's house. So we love this dish. Wow. Good stuff? This is easily one of my favorite Peruvian dishes. Like I just love this sauce and then Peruvian potatoes are some of the best in the world, so it is like you're combining this amazing sauce on top of really well prepared potatoes. That is amazing. And the cool thing about this dish is that you can find it just about everywhere in Peru. You can find this along the coast, in the Sierras and even in the jungle. So yeah, and speaking of presentation this is usually served with black olives and hard boiled eggs. And these are small eggs. I think these are quail eggs because they're quite little. So do you like it? Oh yeah. Maybe I won't be sharing after all. So it is now time to try the second potato dish and that is ocopa a la arequipeña. If you have a look here we can see the plate and it is a little bit different from the previous one. This sauce is a little bit more green. But it is still served with a hard boiled eggs and the black olives. And the two main ingredients to make this sauce are aji and huacatay. No idea what huacatay is. I have never seen this before. No clue. Not very familiar with the food here in Peru. Um, but aside from that the sauce also has a bit of onions, garlic, milk, fresh cheese, some crumbled crackers and peanuts so it should be a bit more crunchy than the one we had earlier. So I'm going to grab a spoon here. It is time to serve yourself. Help myself. Serve yourself up. There we go. Let's grab a bit more sauce so you can really taste it. Alright, time to dig in. Yeah. Oh, and one thing worth noting. If you don't want to go through the trouble of making the sauce from scratch. You can go to the supermarket here in Peru and they sell these little packs that have the powder already pre-made. And you just have to like add a little bit of milk and water and viola! Instant sauce out of the bag. But let's try this. Mmmmmm. So yeah, so this one is a bit sweeter than the one we had earlier. A lot sweeter actually. A lot sweeter. Wow. In the past when I've had it at my family's place it is a bit more crunchy. Because I guess they don't really chop their peanuts that finely so you can still kind of taste them. But this one is very smooth and very creamy. And it is a bit spicier than the Huancaína we had earlier. So it is kind of spicy and sweet. It is good. It is good but I still prefer Papa a la Huancaína. That is just a classic. So after that potato heavy meal we decided, you know what, we've still got room for dessert. So we've ordered this beautiful thang. It is basically arroz con leche and mazamorra morada. So this would be rice pudding and the other one is kind of like a purple corn pudding that has been thickened with cornstarch. And it has shredded coconut on top, as well as cinnamon, so that looks really nice. And the running joke on our channel is that this looks a lot better than what you'd find at Wongs. Because I remember, remember a year ago we tried it at Wongs and everyone was horrified. Yeah. It was fine. So this is a fancier dessert. Mmmm. Still pipping hot. Oh wow. That is good. A lot better than Wongs huh? I suppose. We had it cold at Wongs. This one is like freshly made. You can't beat homemade. So is it really sweet? Or? Not overly sweet but I mean it is like rich and creamy. It is really nice. And do you like the half and half combo? Mmmmmhmmm. I wonder if we should just swirl it around. Time for price point Sam. It sure is. So that meal came to 81 Soles and I have to admit we're a keeping a couple of secrets from you. First, off we ordered a big salad that we didn't show in the video and the second big secret is that I got a second dessert. That was one of the best desserts I've had in Lima or in Peru. It was so good that I didn't even want to film it. Like just leave me alone, just let me eat it on my own. By myself. I don't want the camera on me. Alright, so in US dollars what would 81 Soles be? So you'd be looking at just over about under $25 dollars. So yeah. Pretty good value and really tasty. Man, we are full. Especially me I really overate in this meal. Time to go walk it off. #eatPERU So for today's video we are at a place called Sanguchisimo and we're going to be eating salchipapas by popular demand. We had all of these people being like if you're in Lima you have to eat salchipapa. So we listened to you, we tracked down this place and we're excited to be trying this dish. We've actually ordered two variations of it. We're having salchipapa, which is french fries with hot dogs and we're also having choripapas, which is sausage with hot dogs. And we got both portions fully loaded with cheese and fried eggs. So that is coming. I'm expecting a lot of food. So I also got myself a drink. This is a fresh fruit smoothie, it is strawberry, orange and pineapple. And I haven't had tropical fruits in a really long time. So, pretty excited for this. Mmmmm. Wow, that is fresh a little bit tangy. Mmmmmm. So good. Aji. Si. Muchas gracias. So our choripapas and salchipapas have arrived. We've got the sausage one and the hot dog one. Look at those portions. That is a thing of beauty. And this is a street food snack that originated in the streets of Lima. But now it has spread all over Latin America so you can find it in other countries which is pretty cool. Different variations everywhere. And it comes with four different sausages that we've got here on this plate. We've got ketchup, mayo, mustard and of course aji. I think the aji is my favorite one. Yes, mine too. So we may need to ask for an extra container. And this is like a really nice spicy sauce that you'll find almost everywhere in Peru. It is always a staple at the table. So yeah, really looking forward to digging into this. It looks fantastic. So let's just go for it. So on top here we have. Look at all of that cheese! Yeah, that is a lot of cheese and some fried egg as well. And when we were placing our order they asked us do you want your egg like well fried or do you want it a little bit runny. And there is nothing that grosses out Sam more than runny eggs. So we got ours well done, sunny side up. So yeah, I kind of like my eggs runny. I like them juicy. I don't like my runny eggs. It just grosses me out when the yolk bursts. Sam is always like take it away. I can't look at the plate. Take it away. But anyways, I've got a little bit of everything on here. My french fry, my hot dog, my egg and cheese. Dip it in the sauce. And yes, let's dip it into the aji. Load up on that aji. That is a massive bite. And hot. Owe! A little messy. Wow. That is good. Give me one minute. This is wonderful. If I were a kid I feel like I would want to eat this everyday. I would be like Mom, please salchipapa for lunch. Hahaha. It is really good. It is really hot. I just burned my mouth when I took that first bite. But look at that. Yeah, it has got a lot of ingredients that kids would love. Yeah. You've got your french fries, you've got your cheese, you've got your eggs, you've got your hot dog, you've got your nice sauces. That is ticking off a lot of boxes for sure. It is wonderful. And I have to say the aji at this restaurant is actually really spicy. It is the spiciest which I've had. I'm very happy with mine. So it is now Sam's turn. And he's having the choripapa which has chorizo. So this is actually just literally identical to the one you're having except that you can see right here instead of the hot dog we've got the little slices of chorizo. So I'm going to do the same as you, I'm going to get some egg, I'm going to get some cheese, I'm going to get some fries. It is already spilling over. It is a big portion so I'm going to double dip it. So let's do the aji and a little bit of ketchup. Oh, I tainted it. Tainted the sauce. Tainted sauce. Oh yeah? Oooh, yeah. Yeah, wow. That is really really tasty. It is like I'm definitely prefer chorizo to hot dog so this one is specifically tailored for me. I love chorizo so this is really tasty and just the fries are done to perfection. Then you add the egg and cheese and those two different sauces. Yeah, that is really really nice. Yeah, and I'm also glad that we ordered individual portions because we were initially thinking oh maybe this will be enough to share. Nope. But once we tried it it was like no, we each want our own. I'll be eating all of this don't you worry. Okay, so this is what is leftover. I couldn't finish my fries. Sam did pretty well. Damage control. Yeah, as I promised I took care of mine. I'm not going to overeat and eat Audrey's too but you know what I did a good job over here. Okay, and let's talk about the price for each of these. So these were 18 Soles. So you're looking roughly at five US dollars. Not bad value, you're going to leave feeling stuffed if you finish the whole thing like I did. This is a meal in and of itself. Absolutely. Try it if you're in Peru - especially Lima. So it is dinnertime here in Lima and we are at a place called La Lucha which speciazlies in sandwiches so we've ordered a Chicharrón sandwich which is like a fried pork. It should be really tasty. We are waiting for our food to get here. And yeah, let's get started. So our food has arrived. Yeah we've got our Pan con Chicharrón. It's looking good. It looks amazing. If you look down here you really get a good tour of what we have. So we've got a bun and inside it looks like we've got lots of onion. I'm guessing it is sweet onion. Yeah. Then we have the fried pork and then the kamote - the sweet potato. Exactly. So that looks like a pretty awesome sandwich. Let's try it now. Yes. Alright, it is my first bite. Mmmm. It's so good. It's so good. You know what really makes a sandwich. I mean the meat is awesome it is really good quality but it is the sweet potato. I love having sweet potato in my sandwich. That's an unusual ingredient but it works doesn't it? It does. Look at that. Oh. So it is now my turn to taste the magic. The magic in your hands. Wow. That is wonderful. I think my favorite part is actually the onions. So are they more sweet? Sweet and I think. I wonder if it has a little bit of vinegar. It's a little sour which I really like. Oh no, lemon. I think it is lemon drizzled on the onions. That is what it tastes like. Mmmmm. So so good. And of course we had to get a side order of fries. Yeah, because no sandwich would be complete without a healthy portion of fries. And these are really crispy looking fries that you can actually still have the skin still on them. Yeah. So we've got three different dunking sauces. I have no idea what they are. So I'm going to try them one by one. Let's try this one first. That's like a tangy tartar sauce. And the fries are really tasty. Yeah, I'm guessing this is ketchup. Yes. Hmmm. Was it? He guessed correctly once again. But it is sweeter than North American ketchup. Yeah. And last one - I'm thinking that might be. I'm going to guess mayo. Good guess. You nailed that. Bingo. Alright, and to wash it all down I got this strawberry smoothie. Mmmm. Which is really like thick and frothy and sweet. You can tell they use fresh strawberries. It's really good. So how much was it for that good greasy meal? Alright, so that delicious feast of a meal was 30 Soles which in the current exchange rate is actually less than 10 US dollars that included our huge sandwich, our fries and a strawberry smoothie that was delicious. So not bad, right? #eatPERU So it is past twelve noon which I think means it is acceptable to get a little boozy. We are going to be doing a taste test of Pisco Sour versus Chilcano. Both drinks are made with Pisco but they are quite different so those should be coming soon. And what goes better with Pisco than a little bit of cake. Exactly! So we're getting an alfajor and normally it comes in a like a biscuit form but this time apparently it is coming in torta cake size. So that is something unique, we've never tried that before so it is going to be pretty cool. So the cocktail has arrived. This is the Pisco Sour. Yes. And this is my all-time favorite Peruvian drink. It is amazing. I can't wait to try it here. So how does it taste? As you might imagine. It is sour. But also quite sweet. Yeah. So, the Pisco Sour is made from a number of different ingredients so you've got your grape brandy the Pisco which actually comes from the town of Pisco here in Peru. Yeah. Then you've got your egg white on top. If you take a look down here you've got your egg white on top, a little bit of bitter which is the brown. Nice and frothy. Yes, that is the key. And then here you also have lemon or lime juice and often a little bit of syrup added to give it some extra bit of sugar. Extra bit of sweet. So that is one very sweet cocktail. Very refreshing on a hot day. Yeah, and this is considered the National drink of Peru. Mixing it all up with my little seahorse. So I ordered the Chilcano and this is a cocktail that is made with Pisco, ginger ale and a little bit of lime juice. There is a hair. There is a hair. You know who would really like this? Would be my Mom. She loves ginger ale. Ooh. That is a little stronger than I was expecting. Potent. Potent. I was hoping it would be a little bit watered down with all of the ice cubes but no that is definitely got Pisco in there and you can taste it. It burns on the way down. I might need to help you out with that one huh? Actually, the first time we tried Chilcanos it was in Cusco, we thought we were going to a Pisco museum but when we got there it was actually more like a bar. So we ordered I think it was like four different Chilcanos with different flavors. So that was pretty cool. This one that I'm having right now is just the classic. Basically ginger ale, lime and Pisco. But you can get fancy and like make strawberry ones, cinnamon ones and just you know different flavors. So we also got a little bit of dessert to go along with our drinks since we already had lunch. We sure did. How could we miss out on the opportunity to have dessert, right? So this is really interesting. This is the cake form of a Peruvian alfajor. Mmmmm. I already started eating mine while you weren't looking. That is so good. I just absolutely love alfajores. Like we devoured them when we were in Argentina, we liked them here in Peru and to have it in cake form that is really unique. Like it has all of these different layers. Yeah, thin layers and it is super crumbly and in between each layer you have manjar blanco, which is kind of like dulce de leche, and then icing sugar sprinkled all over top. Yeah, exactly. And there isn't that much manjar blanco in between each layer so you definitely taste it but it is not overwhelming. Really good though. #eatPERU It is lunchtime again here in Lima and today we are going to be trying a traditional dish called Ají de gallina. This is probably like one of those national dishes that you can find at almost any restaurant. But we're eating it at a place called Republica which makes Peruvian dishes but kind of like in a casual fast food setting. So yeah, it should be interesting. We've placed our order and that should be coming soon. Cat friend. Hi, cat friend. Hi. Okay, so the food is already here. That came very quickly. So let's have a look at the plate. This is Ají de gallina and as you can see it is kind of like a chicken stew. It is made with shredded chicken and the sauce has a cream, cheese and peanut base. And also the way they thicken this sauce is by adding bread crumbs that have been soaked in either a broth or milk and this is served with rice or boiled potatoes. And the boiled potatoes and kind of hiding underneath all of the chicken here. Oh, we do have boiled potatoes. We do. Yeah. I thought we were just given rice. So this is a very hearty meal. I'm kind of glad we're sharing one plate because there is no way I could eat all of this. Um, but yeah, let's dig right in. I'm just going to try it with rice here. Look at that. This looks so good. This is one of my favorite ways that chicken is prepared here in Peru. I love this dish. Mmmmhmmm. And, I don't know if I forgot to mention this but another key ingredient is Aji. The hot pepper. But because it has a cream base it is not super spicy. So I really love this. Look, they actually gave us aji sauce too. In case we want it spicier. Maybe we should add a little bit. In case it wasn't enough. Yeah, just dunk it all over that rice. I'm not sure if that is how it is done but that is how we do it. So let's see if that has more kick now. Another quality control bite. Quality control. That is what we call it. Mmmmm. Now it is spicier. That is good. Nice and creamy too? Feel the burn. Hahaha. So it is now Sam's turn to dig in. Yes, my turn. And what is really cool about this dish is like you were saying it is kind of a everyday dish. An everyday part of Peruvian cuisine and this is something we've had a lot at your Aunt and Grandma's house. Oh yes, this is our first time to film it but it is a dish we are very familiar with. Yeah, we've been eating it at least once a week. At least. I'm getting myself a nice big bite here. For me it is just the sauce that makes it. I love the cheese and the cream and peanuts. Those are all ingredients I really like. And then when you add tender chicken to that and a little bit of rice. That is just such a winning combo. And to wash this all down what did you get? I got myself a strawberry smoothie and this is oh natural with no sugar added. So it is not super sweet but it is healthy. Good stuff. Taste those strawberries? So we polished that off in like a minute and a half. Yeah, more like demolished it. But what was really cool about this is that it tasted homemade even though this is kind of a fast food type of joint. The actual Ají de gallina it tasted homemade. Yeah you could of fooled me. It tasted like what we've been eating at my family's place. Yeah, yeah. It was amazing. Authentic, delicious, cheap and really tasty. So now tell us how much did we spend on that delicious Ají de gallina? You know what, it wasn't expensive. It was only 14 Soles so in total that was four dollars and fifty cents US. Really good value and yeah I'd recommend coming here because the food was authentic, homemade style and we're satisfied. Yeah, so this place is called Republica. Yum. #eatPERU Well hello. We are back in Lima again. I think this is like the third round. The third time? Third time in the last year. Yeah, so we've been coming here quite often and it is lunchtime so we're going to go make a video and today we're going to be doing a Peruvian fast food. So there is a place called Bembos which is kind of like a fast food chain like a McDonald's or Burger King so we're going to go check it out and see what kind of burgers they have there. Yeah, and they have some specialty burgers that are unique to that chain. You'll only find them in Peru. Yes, you'll only find them in Peru. So, exciting times. So our food is finally ready. It is not really fast food over here. It probably took like 15 minutes for everything to come out. But check out those burgers. We upgraded to the large size and those are massive. I think we're going to have trouble just holding them. So on the menu they have two burgers that are Peruvian. So we got a lo pobre which is this one here. And then we also. Lift up that one. Let's check that out. That is like a really thick burger, a fried egg and we'll see what else once we bite into it. And this one here is called Huachana. And I think it has some kind of pork. So yeah, those are huge. Those are like some of the biggest burgers I've ever seen. We also got fries. Here, they are like spilling over. And for our beverage we got chicha morada which is a purple corn drink. Very Peruvian so we had to get it with this meal. Um, but this might be in soda form actually. I don't think it is just juice. Yeah, and we got some special sauces too. And some sauces. I got a little bit of ketchup but I mostly loaded up on this - it is called aji and it is a spicy sauce. We like our spice so we've got two little pots of those. Now let's dig in. Okay, so Sam is up first. His is hamburguesa a lo pobre. Yes, and it gets its name from the a lo pobre. Lomo a lo pobre which is a Peruvian dish that is really popular. It is basically a steak with a fried egg on top. Yeah, exactly. So we've got tonnes of mayo on here. We've got a fried egg and one of the cool ingredients it looks like we've got some fried plantain too. Oh, wow. Oh man, and then we've got the veggies on the bottom. Man, that is so thick. It is massive. I want to see you bite into it. Mmmmm. That was a big bite. Yeah, that is a nice burger. That is a very thick piece of patty. Piece of meat on there. And it is good quality too. I mean it is a fast food style burger but I would say this is more like a premium type of burger. A premium type of fast food. Really really good and the egg is a nice addition. And wow, those fried bananas, it gives it a little bit of extra juiciness. I really like it. Want to take a second bite? Just for research purposes, you know. Research. To make sure you like it a second time around. Some extra plantain. Mmmmm. Oh, yeah. Satisfied boy over here. Okay, so it is time for mine. This one is Huachana. I had never heard of this before up until this morning. And I was trying to do a little bit of research online and it would appear that Hauchana is kind of like the stuffing for a sausage, a pork sausage. That is what I got out of it. It also has these crispy little fries. I'm not sure what these are called in English but I know you can buy it as a snack. Kind of like crisps or chips. And what else is in there? Some lettuce. So let's just dig in. This is huge. I don't know how I'm going to bite into it. Nom, nom, nom. Mmmmm. That is a big burger. Wow. Yeah, really juicy. I'm not entirely sure. I'm still not sure if this is pork or what. This orange stuff but it is really spicy. So I like that. It gives it a bit of extra flavor. And honestly I feel like you can come to Bembos and just order the regular size burger and that would be enough. I feel like the large is enough for two people. Hahaha. We're going to struggle to finish these. Yeah, but it is also kind of cool how this has chips in it. I don't think I've ever had a burger. A hamburger with chips. Like crispy chips. Mmmmm. Good stuff. I'm usually not a huge fan of fast food. Sam had to convince me to come here but I'm glad I did. Okay, french fry taste test. So one dunked in ketchup and one dunked in the aji sauce. Oh la lah. I'll try that ketchup first. Mmmm. It's good. Yeah, it is you know your classic fast food french fry with ketchup. I find that it is extra salty here. Yeah, they really loaded up on the salt which we like. Salt and grease. Mmmm. Mmmmmm. Wow, now that is a unique sauce and it is spicy and it has got a real tang. That is good. I've never had this sauce come to think of it. This is my first time to try it and I instantly like it. So it is cool, I'm glad that you got us a second thing of it. Yeah. And now it is time for the beverage. Chicha morada. Mmmm. That is nice. So okay, I thought it was going to be kind of like a fizzy soda drink since we're at a fast food chain. But it is actually the juice. the proper juice. The purple corn juice. So if you want to have a look inside that is what it looks like. And yeah, it doesn't taste like corn so don't be scared if you come to Peru and you're like they're drinking corn juice. It is really sweet. And it also very refreshing on a hot day. It sure is. Chicha! So someone still had enough room for dessert. I don't know how that is possible. Not really. We're doing this for you guys. We're stuffed. For the taste test. We're doing this for the taste test. So we got a Doña Pep ice cream. And this is the Doña Pep. It is kind of like a cookie covered in chocolate with sprinkles. Yes, and then down here we have your classic soft serve ice cream which appears to have some sparkles in it. So, let's try those. Sprinkles and fudge. Wow. He approves. He approves the dessert. That is a nice way to end things off. Yeah, with something sweet. It looks like such a magical dessert with all those sprinkles. Look at that. So that was a super filling fast food lunch. What did you think of Peruvian fast food at Bembos? Yeah, it was like so much bigger than I thought it would be. It was a massive burger. I'm just so stuffed I think I need a siesta now. And I thought the ingredients were really cool. Having things like plantain in a hamburger. Really unique things that I would have never considered putting in a burger. It was pretty awesome. And price point. Price point was forty five Soles which is about $12 or 13 USD dollars right now. So that included the two massive burgers, the fries, the chicha morada and the ice cream. So yeah, pretty good value and it is time for us to go take a nap. Okay, let's got to the apartment for a siesta.",False,"20170410 - Peruvian Food Guide ≡ƒç╡≡ƒç¬ ∩╜£ Best Local Eats in Lima & Cusco (Chifa, Alpaca, Aji╠ü de Gallina & More!).en.srt"

This month Sam and I are exploring Buenos Aires the Argentinian capital. And this video is going to show you 50 things to do around the city. Buenos Aires is one of our favorite cities in the world, so as soon as we arrived, we hit the ground running. In this guide we'll be visiting numerous neighborhoods including Recoleta, San Telmo, Boca and Palermo, while showcasing a mix of fun activities and main attractions. And since we're huge foodies, we'll also be introducing you to a few Argentine dishes you simply cannot miss. For anyone planning a trip to the capital, here are 50 things to do in Buenos Aires: Let’s begin with the city’s most identifiable landmark. The obelisk is located at the intersection of Avenida 9 de Julio and Avenida Corrientes, and it was built to commemorate the fourth centenary of the founding of the city. The pink house is home to the president’s office. Apparently it was painted pink to diffuse tension between the 2 opposing political parties: red for the Federals, and white for the Unitarians. La Boca is the most colorful neighborhood in Buenos Aires, and there is one particular stretch of road called Caminito which is really popular with visitors. Here you can see live tango performances, shop for souvenirs, and have fun photographing the brightly coloured houses. We came all the way to Boca to meet Messi number 10. So for the hardcore football fans another cool thing you can do in Buenos Aires is visit the Boca Juniors stadium. It is called La Bombonera and that means the chocolate box. I don't really think it looks like a chocolate box. I mean it is this giant yellow stadium. Colorful chocolate box. But yeah, it is right over there. So let's go check it out. If you’re into football, you may want to consider doing a stadium tour, or even attending a match against Boca Junior’s rival: River Plate. This may seem like a rather morbid attraction for a city guide, however, Recoleta Cemetery is one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world. It contains elaborate mausoleums with statues, crosses, and guarding angels watching over the tombs. It also contains the graves of notable people, but none is more visited than that of Evita Peron. So we're going for a stroll through the Japanese Gardens and it feels like we're back in Asia. The Japanese Gardens are located in Palermo and they are cared for the by the Japanese Argentine Cultural Foundation. Inside the grounds you’ll find a lake filled with colourful carp, and all manner of Japanese vegetation. You do have to pay admission to visit, but it’s worth every cent as the gardens are perfectly manicured. So I know we always say we're excited about this meal but today it is extra special because we're bringing you to our favorite restaurant in all of Buenos Aires. This is a steakhouse. It is a Parrilla. That means they cook all of their meat on the grill. And it is seriously the best meat we've tried in the city. And we've ordered our favorite cut - Bife de Lomo. It is going to be amazing. We're waiting for that to show up. The star of the meal has arrived. The star of the meal. Bife de lomo. Look at this piece of beauty on my fork. Oooh. That is some of the most tender meat I've ever had in my entire life. You bite into it and it just disintegrates, it just like melts right into your mouth. And it is so juicy and flavorful. It is just fantastic. This is the tenderloin cut in English. It is the best. And you know what makes this restaurant awesome. You know how you can tell you're in a really good steakhouse. They don't ask you how you want your steak. They don't say do you want it rare, do you want it medium rare, do you want it well done? No, they just make it the house way and they know what they're doing. So you get the best most optimal steak possible. Speaking of food, if you want to try Milanesa, another place to visit is El Club de la Milanesa. They specialize in this dish and have great sampler portions. This looks like guacamole, barbecue sauce, mustard, this looks like mozzarella cheese with a tomato and basil, this one is ham and cheese and tomato sauce, this is a cream of cheddar and melted cheddar with bacon over top. We couldn't decide which one to order so why not get a sampler portion. Yeah, so we get seven different ones to sample and that comes with a salad and these delicious potatoes. Cheesy fries. Alright, this looks good. Let's get all the toppings on there. Mmmm. How is that. That's nice. Oh, yeah. So, that is veal, cheddar cheese, a little bit of bacon. Um, and like thinly sliced spring onions on top. And it is really tender meat. Like it is so soft. Wow. We are visiting one of the most beautiful bookstores in the world. This is called El Ateneo Grand Splendid. This place actually used to be a theater and then it was converted into a movie theatre and now it is a bookstore. And it is absolutely beautiful. Okay, so this section where we're standing now would have been where they had like the rows of seats facing this stage which is over that way. Um, but when they did the conversion they had to remove all of those seats and they put rows of books instead. Books. Um, and also the stage where they would have had performances has been turned into a cafe, so if you follow me around the corner I can show you that. If you’re around Puerto Madero, another meal to try is the ‘choripan’. This dish gets its name by combining two words - chorizo (for sausage) and pan (for bread). There are lots of stands along the edge of the Costanera Sur Ecological Reserve, and it’s worth waiting in line. We added a little bit of chimichurri to ours and it was absolutely delicious! (Live Music Playing) (Speaking Spanish) The San Telmo Sunday Fair is a hippie market slash antique fair that takes place in Plaza Dorrego and spills on to Calle Defensa. Here you can pick up souvenirs, listen to live music, sample some of the street food, or browse some antiques for your own collection. So this is something I find really strange. At the market they are selling people's old family photos. And you can even find like government documents. It is a bit odd. I'm not sure how this ended up at a flea market. And I wonder like who these families are and how they feel about their possessions being sold. Family moments. Since Buenos Aires is the birthplace of tango, no visit to the city would be complete without going to a tango show. If you’re feeling a bit more ambitious, you can also join a tango dancing lesson. Cafe Tortoni was once the gathering place for the nation’s writers and great thinkers. It still retains its old world Parisian-inspired feel, and it’s a nice place to stop for a coffee and something sweet, even if it’s just to get a glimpse of the interior. Floralis Generica is a flower sculpture located in Plaza de las Naciones Unidas. What makes this sculpture pretty cool is that it is designed to open its petals in the morning and close them in the evening. Just across the street, you’ll also find the National Museum of Fine Arts. It holds an international collection of paintings from the Middle Ages up to the 20th century, as well as works by Argentine artists. For a shopping experience in Buenos Aires unlike any other, you should head over to Galerias Pacifico. Located at the intersection of Calle Florida and Avenida Cordoba, this structure boasts hand-painted frescoes, a glass covered atrium, and plenty of high end brands. (Ducks Quacking) Palermo Woods is a large urban park located in the neighborhood of Palermo. It’s popular with joggers and cyclists, and you can even rent a rowboat to take out on the lake. If you’re looking for a family-friendly activity or something to do on a rainy day, you can consider visiting the Galileo Galilei planetarium which is also in Palermo. So right around the corner from the Evita Museum you have the Evita Cafe. And we are having afternoon tea here. We just ordered a sampler plate of different types of desserts. And this looks amazing. Like we've got flan, brownie, tiramisu and a few surprises that I think we're going to have to bite into to find out what they are. And a little bit of coffee. Café con leche. So this is going to be fun. The Evita Museum looks back on the life of Peron’s wife and her appeal as a national heroine. The restaurant just behind is perfect for al fresco dining on a weekend. So this video is about ice cream because Buenos Aires has some of the best ice cream we have ever tried. And our favorite place to go to is Freddo. We found this place towards the start of our visit and we've been coming like every other day. Hahaha. Shoosh. Don't tell anyone. Um, but yeah, so we ended up getting some ice cream this afternoon. And what you see here is a quarter of a kilo. So this is 250 grams of ice cream and you get to choose three flavors. So this one here is Forest berries. Look at that. Mmmm. And that is actually my favorite flavor at Freddo. I order it every time I come here. And it is like really thick and creamy and it has a rich vanilla flavor but it also has chunks of real fruit. And I couldn't tell you what the forest berries are. I don't know if it is blackberries or blueberries. It could be anything. But it is delicious. As for the other flavors, I'm having raspberry, and this is like a raspberry sorbet so it is a little bit watery instead of being like creamy. So I kind of like it because it is refreshing. And on this side, for my third flavor, I chose strawberry. Some might say that is a little boring but whatever. I like strawberry. That's almost vanilla. Hahaha. Mmmm. Yeah. But my favorite has got to be this one on the side. Forest berries. Forest berry for the win. Florida Street is another popular shopping area. This pedestrian only street runs for about a kilometer and it is lined with stores on either side. You can also exchange money on the street, get a shoe shine, or watch some of the buskers get creative with their costumes. So one of the experiences that has been recommended time and time again is to go and have lunch at a Bodegón. And that is kind of like an old fashioned tavern. It has a very family oriented feel. And it is kind of simple, classic. You know the focus is on good food and large hearty portions. So that is what we're doing right now. We're eating at a place called Norte. Restaurante Norte. We've just placed our order and the food should be arriving soon. So Sam you're looking happy over there. Why is that? Yes, my bife de lomo al champignon has arrived. Which is basically steak with mushrooms and I think kind of a gravy and these look like homemade wedges like home fries. Pan fries. Oh, look at the gravy. Look at all of the gravy. It is swimming in gravy. And it looks like it has sort of garlic. No, that is mushrooms. So I'm going to try the meat. I've served myself up a little portion. I'm going to make sure I've got lots of gravy and a potato at the same time. Oh man, I'm so excited for this. Wow! Wow, he says. Wow! That is some tender meat. And I've never had this kind of steak with gravy before. And it is like having like Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner except with steak instead of turkey. And the steak is a lot better than any turkey I've ever had. This is amazing. Puerto Madero is another neighbourhood you should check out on your visit to Buenos Aires. The area sits along the waterfront and it has undergone a massive regeneration effort in the last couple of decades. Old warehouses have been turned into lofts, restaurants, and art spaces, and it’s quite lively if you swing by on a weekend. ARA Presidente Sarmiento is a former training ship turned museum that is docked in Puerto Madero. The ship was named after the 7th president of Argentina and you can go on board and explore the different levels. Another day, another slice of pizza. Today we're at Pizzería Güerrin, one of the most famous pizzerias in all of Buenos Aires. This is one of Sam's favorite spots in the whole city and we're here for lunch. We've placed our order and we're waiting for the pizza to arrive. So the pizza has arrived and we have to start with the specialty of the house. It is called pizza Güerrin. So that is this slice over here. Look at that. Oh, my goodness. The toppings are falling off. Wow, that has got a lot going on. Cheese. I see olives. What else is there? It is a really thick crust first of all. The tomato sauce is kind of unusual. It is really chunky and you have mozzarella cheese, slices of ham, red peppers and an olive. So that is like fully loaded in my eyes. So let's dig right in. Look at me. Using a fork and a knife to cut my pizza. How sophisticated. Fancy. It's hot. Oh, man. Mmmmm. Oh, wow. Ooey gooey goodness? And it is a little bit greasy with all of the cheese. That is some really thick cheese they have. So it is really nice but let me actually get some pepper in there. So I can tell you if it is good or not. So next up is Fugazetta. Fugazetta. And Fugazetta is normally onions but this Fugazetta with ham and cheese. Look at all of the onions on here. And you can see the ham right there. That is awesome. Mmmm. Wow. You know what if you think the first slice of pizza had a lot of cheese this one has I would swear like double or triple. Like it is just overloaded with cheese. And for someone who likes cheese as much as me that is a very good thing. Plaza San Martin is a park located in the neighbourhood of Retiro. The plaza gets its name from the giant sculpture of Jose de San Martin, the nation’s liberator. Just off of Plaza San Martin, you can also visit the Malvinas War Memorial which commemorates the Argentine soldiers who fought against the British in the Falkland War. It is lunchtime. Our favorite time of day. Today we're eating at a place called La Americana. And the slogan is La Reina de las Empanadas. The queen of the empanadas, so that is exactly what we're going to be trying. We've ordered a sampler plate with five different ones and that should be coming really soon. They have arrived. Yes, and I think we may have ordered one too many because these are massive. Two or three too many. These are gigantic. They're a lot bigger than what we were expecting so I think we'll have some leftovers for dinner or maybe a quick snack. Um, but anyway let's dig right in. I'm going to start with this one right here. I'm going to start with this one right here. This one is called Cuyanita. It is a meat empanada that has been deep-fried. So let's just cut into it first so you can see the filling. There we go. It is steaming. So you can see the beef there, there is a green olive and also a bit of egg. I'm going to have to wait for this to cool down. I think it is fresh out of the deep fryer to be honest. It is burning my fingers. Blow on your food. Mmmmm. Oh, oh my gosh. That is one of the best ones I've had in the country. I kid you not. But have a look. The meat is kind of juicy. It is really nice and also the dough it is made with lard. So you kind of get like a salty greasiness coming through which probably isn't healthy but it tastes amazing. And which one are you trying next? I'm trying Criolla which is also a meat one but apparently this one is baked as opposed to fried. So let's dissect that here. Oh, look you can see the juices. The science lab. The juices are coming out. Oh, wow. Wow! Wow. Oh, wow! You know what I don't even know I can really hold it. Oh, that has got a green olive in it as well. You can see it steaming. Look at that. Oh, baby. Let's try that. So you also had a bit of mine which was deep-fried. So you'll have to compare the two. You know what, there is one common element between the two of them and that is that there is so much awesome juicy ingredients inside. Like, these are some of the best empanadas we've had in South America not just in Buenos Aires. They're so juicy and so flavorful. Honestly, the only difference really between the fried and the baked one is just how the dough tastes on the outside. The fried one is a bit more crispier whereas this one has more of that typical baked type of texture. Teatro Colon is the main opera house in Buenos Aires, and acoustically, it is considered to be one of the top venues in the world. They offer guided tours during the day, however, no video or flash photography is allowed. So today's video is all about breakfast and the plan is to show you an Argentinian breakfast. Or a desayunar. Now we wanted to go to a really nice cafe that is near the Recoleta Cemetery; however, it is pouring rain outside so we just ran out of our apartment and found the nearest cafe and popped in. So we've placed our order, we are hungry and yeah we're going to be showing you what breakfast looks like in this part of the world. So Sam our breakfast has arrived. Breakfast has arrived. A quick intro to breakfast in Argentina. I am a very happy boy. Well, the cool thing about breakfast in Argentina is that they like to keep it simple and sweet. And that makes it one of my favorite meals here. So I'm pretty happy with what I ordered. I got Café con leche which is coffee with milk. The milk is super frothy by the way. Check that out. I'm not even a coffee drinker. I normally go for tea but when in Argentina you've got to do it right. You've got to get some coffee. And then over here I have my medialuna. Which is like a croissant. This one is made with butter and I have facturas which are little pastries. So this one is made with crema pastelera which is kind of like a yellow cream similar to Boston Cream. And this one is stuffed with quince jam. So super excited about that. This is going to be a good breakfast and I'm just going to dig right in. I'm not waiting for you. Ha! Mmmm. So, I bit most of the jam out but if you have a look inside. It is like a little croissant roll. A butter roll stuffed with quince jam which is so good. Mmmhmmm. So Sam can you tell us what you ordered for breakfast. I sure can. So if you take a look down here I'm having something called tostadas which essentially is toast. Yes. It is a massive generous portion. It's a lot of toast. 6 slices. Yeah, I was thinking maybe like two slices but I've got six. And what I'm most excited about here is this is like a whipped butter and it looks amazing. So I'm just going to pour it, not pour it, spread it all over and then take a bit of the jam. I wonder what kind of jam it is. It looks like it may be cherry jam actually. Cherry or a dark raspberry. So getting that ready. Let's see how good this toast is. Wow. That is some mighty fine toast. Starting the day with sugar. Oh, yeah. Palermo is one of the trendier neighbourhoods in the city, with wide tree lined boulevards, a mix of old mansions and luxury condos, plus lots of cafes with outdoor seating. It’s worth a visit even if you’re staying in a different part of the city. A romantic walk through the tree tunnels Sam. Will you give me a kiss. Mwah. The Botanical Gardens are located in Palermo and it’s a cool place to visit because the vegetation is arranged by region. You can follow the signs to set foot in Africa, Europe, Oceania, Asia, or America, all in one place. So for today's lunch we are eating at El Palacio de la Papa Frita. That is the French Fry Palace. And actually here they specialize in potatoes. Fried potatoes. And they have so many different varieties. So what we've done is order a basket, as a bit of a sampler, showcasing the best of the best. And I think that is coming. So the most famous potato that they have here is called papa souffle. And as you can see it is like blown-up like a little bubble. And they're kind of secretive about how these are made. I've heard a few different theories. Some people say it is because they soak the potatoes in cold water and then fry them. Other people have told me that they use really high heat when they're cooking them and that results in like a little bubble potato. Um, so yeah, I don't actually know the truth. So if you know the truth leave us a little comment. Um, but actually I remember trying these potatoes when I first moved to Argentina. When I was six years old. And I love these. I just thought it was the coolest thing ever. Bubble potatoes, so it is nice to be having them again. And yeah, it is just air inside but you want to be careful when you bite into it because like there is so much steam that comes out. I don't know if you can see that but it is still steaming. And what are those called locally? Papa souffle. Like a souffle, you know how it rises when you cook it. That is the name of it. The nightlife in Buenos Aires gets going late and continues strong until sunrise. When we visited in our younger years, Sam and I both did pub crawls, but this time around we tried something milder and enjoyed a picada with a cerveza at a bar. So we are now going to try crossing one of the widest avenues in the whole world. So we made it about half way. We have a red light. We'll wait for that one and then we'll be across. There we go. That was probably like twelve lanes or more. Let’s face it, you’re going to encounter at least one protest while you visit Buenos Aires. It was our experience that there was some type of demonstration at least every other day, but if there’s one thing we really admire about people in this country it’s that they are very politically active and they’ll take to the streets to make their voices heard. (Drums and chanting) Another smaller and less crowded alternative to the San Telmo Market is the Recoleta Sunday Market. Here you’ll find lots of stands selling everything from leather goods to tango paintings, and silver jewelry to homemade cakes. You’ll likely also come across a couple of musicians performing. (Live Music) So these giant branches you see here belong to the Ombu tree. And Sam is helping out. Our new statue friend. Because these branches are heavy aren't they Sam? Oh, massively heavy. Massively. And that is the tree off in the distance. Look at how far these branches go. My gosh. And this tree must be hundreds of years old. This is called The Ombu. It is massive. While you’re in the area you can also visit Basílica Nuestra Señora del Pilar which is the second oldest church in the city. Right next door you also have Centro Cultural Recoleta, which is a cultural centre that holds exhibitions, musical performances, movie screenings and workshops throughout the year. So it is five PM here in Buenos Aires which means it is tea time or as we call it here it is Merienda time. So, we're at a little place called La Biela. This is a really famous cafe across from the Recoleta Cemetery. We've got a table, we've ordered our food. And a special surprise should be coming. I'm not going to tell you what Merienda consists of until it gets here. Food dance. The food has arrived. Anyways, there is like waiters starring at me. The food is here which is super exciting for us. So have a look over here. Um, this meal that we ordered it comes with two croissants. So we'll be sharing those. These are called medialunas. And they are sweet buttery media lunas. I love these. And it also comes with a tostado jamon y queso. Which is a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. Yeah, those are really good. We've been having a lot of those in Buenos Aires. Yeah, so super thin, lightly toasted. They are kind of your staple snack sandwich in Argentina, aren't they? So let's start with this. Something savory first and then we'll move on to the desserts. Oh yeah. That's good. Just a very thin layer of ham and cheese. Super light. Like I could probably eat ten of these I mean they are so thin and light. But yeah, good stuff. And our order came with three different slices of pastries, cakes, pies, whatever you want to call it. Sweet treats. So why don't we explain what there is. So this one here has chocolate and I think kind of a cracker filling with dulce de leche. You want to hold it up and show us. Yeah, sure. It is a really thick bar. Check that out. Fancy. So we'll put that down for a moment. Okay. And over here we've got it appears to be like kind of a slice of apple pie. But what is cool about this pie is that it has like a white glaze. A glaze over top of it. Some extra sugar in there. No complaints about that. And last but not least we have this. So that is called Pionono. It is a mini pionono. And it is kind of like a little roll with dulce de leche in the middle. Yeah, and anything with dulce de leche is a hit with us. Costanera Sur is an ecological reserve that consists of lowlands that run along the banks of the River Plate. It’s a great place for a leisurely walk or bike ride, and you’ll also get to see plenty of wildlife along the way - especially birds! MALBA stands for Museo de Arte Latinoamericano en Buenos Aires, and it focuses on Latin American art from the 20th century on wards. The museum is located in Palermo. Alright, so for today's meal we're eating at a place called Cumaná in Buenos Aires. And this restaurant specializes in Northern Argentine food. So these are dishes that you might find in the region of Salta or Jujuy. And the truth is that when we were traveling in Northern Argentina we didn't actually eat a lot of Northern Argentine food aside from empanadas. So it'll be interesting to finally sample those dishes in the capital. So the food came rather quickly. It is already at the table. And since it is a bit of a cooler day outside we decided to both order stews. I'm having one that is called Locro. And it kind of comes in this metal bowl that is really hot and I already made the mistake of touching it. So that won't happen again. But here you can see it is like really thick. You can see the chunks of corn in there. Wow. You have some spring onions, a little bit of spice. That looks so good. Yeah, you'll have to stir it around. Yeah, let's mix it all in. That's probably how you're supposed to eat it anyway. I'd say. So let's mix it all in. And look at that. So it has different cuts of meat as well. I believe this one has pork and beef. So it is very very hearty and as you can see it is still steaming. Like this is piping hot. So maybe I'll give it a few minutes to cool down. Blow on it. Time to dig in. So look at that. There is even sausage in the stew. I had totally missed that when I was mixing it earlier. So let's get a bit of everything. We've got corn, we've got sausage. Mmm. Wow. Pleasantly surprised. Mmmm. It is very rich and thick. It is like a nice stew. It is the type of dish you'd want to have on a winter's day. And it is also a little bit spicy. I'm not entirely sure what that red sauce was. But it is giving a little bit of a kick which is nice. So yeah, I'm happy with my dish. First time trying locro and I think it is a success. Okay, so Sam you're having something called Carbonada Criolla which is also stew. Yes, and mine appears to be piping hot as well. It kind of has the texture and appearance of a chili. It look a bit like chili. And mine has got carrots and it has got corn. It has got beef. Let's try that. A little bit of everything. Yours seems to have more vegetables than mine. Oh, that is delicious. I'm honestly usually not the biggest fan of stews but this is like almost as thick as a chillie. Yeah. Yeah. It is really good and it is quite sweet too. Yeah, and it is really the perfect weather to be having this. It is. It is a little bit rainy these past few days. And I like that it has got a generous amount of meat. And you taste the corn and the carrots a lot. And there is also potato in there as well too. So yeah, this is the perfect dish for us to be having on a cold day in Buenos Aires. And the icing on the cake is that they brought us homemade bread. So check that out. Have a bit of that. And it is like a nice thick slice. And it is a heavier bread. It is really nice. That is come in good with the stew. That's good homemade bread. Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral is located in the city centre and is the main Catholic church in the city. It houses the mausoleum of General Jose de San Martin, who helped liberate numerous countries in South America. You’ll also find a museum to Argentine born Pope Francis. Right next to the cathedral, you’ll also find the cabildo which dates back to colonial times and today acts as a museum. Dadadada. Alright, so as you can probably guess from this for today's video we are in our kitchen in Buenos Aires and we are going to be teaching you how to make Yerba Mate. So, one thing we've noticed here in the supermarkets is that they have entire aisles dedicated to Mate. There must be like fifty varieties out there at least. Seriously, it was like a daunting task. Yeah, how do we choose? Which one is the right one? Um, but if you've never heard of Mate before it is kind of like a green tea. It is basically a green leaf that they kind of like smash together. Um, and you use it to make tea but not in a tea cup. We're going to be using these little things. These little mugs. Um, and normally they are made out of gourd. So that is kind of like a hollowed out pumpkin or something like that. But these are a bit more modern. I've got my matryoshka here. Show them my Monsieur Mustache. My Mr. Mustache. So this one is Sam's. Yeah, I'm excited to try that. Yeah, so you can get some that are made out of wood, there is metal ones, there is a whole bunch to choose from. But anyways, let's start making this thing. So let's open this. This is our first time making it. Oh la lah. It is kind of funny. This is our first time making it and yet we're teaching you how it is done. Ha, ha. Can we be trusted? That is how we roll. That is the question. What is it they say? If you want to learn how to do something teach someone else how to do it. And there you go. We are, so we're going to want to fill it up about 2/3's of the way. Oh, and first you should probably have a look inside the bag. Look at that. So you can see how the leaves have been kind of crushed. You get a really good view from there. It is kind of like a loose leaf. Alright, fill it up two thirds of the way. Two thirds. That would appear to be two thirds. There you go. And they say that you should put your palm over it and kind of shake it to help the. Oh crap, it is going everywhere. Shake it up baby. To help the smaller leaves, or like the powder, settle near the top so it doesn't get stuck in your straw. But my hand is too little so it is flying everywhere. Look at that powder. Anyways, so then we're going to take our little straw. This is called bombila and just stick it right in there at an angle. And then we're going to grab our water which I boiled earlier. You don't want to use boiling hot water so we've had this sitting for a few minutes. Yes, they say the key is 75 degrees. 75 degrees. So, well, I didn't really check the temperature guys, but let's just go with that. There we go. Filler up. Filler up buttercup. There we are. Have a look at that. It is still bubbling. Oh, did we do it wrong. Oh! I guess it is time to try it. So ready for the first sip. I didn't add any sugar to mine because I don't normally have sugar with my tea. Oh natural. Oh natural. Let's have a sip of this. Mmmm. Yes. It's been a while since I had this. I never really enjoyed it as a kid when I was living in Argentina. I always thought it was gross and bitter. Haha. So it is interesting trying it as an adult. How many years later. Have your taste buds matured a little bit? Would you say? Yeah, I'm used to drinking green tea now so I do like this. It is a little bit bitter and it kind of has a grassy flavor. Can you taste those herbs? Yeah, I mean it tastes green. Like grass. Like I'm eating grass in a field. Like a horse. Hahaha. Yeah, so it is actually nice. I am enjoying it. Um, and as you can see the water level has kind of gone down so you just grab some more hot water and keep refilling this. And the cool thing about this is you can fill it up upwards to 10 to 20 times before you need to replace the Mate. Yeah, so you can just. And it is a very social drink. Like if you see people drinking this on the streets of Buenos Aires you'll notice they'll be passing around the same gourd and the same straw. Yes. You just share. Saliva doesn't matter. Just pass it along. There you go. When it comes to biking in Buenos Aires, you can either choose a guided tour to take you around specific neighborhoods in the city or hire a bike to explore on your own. Alternatively, if you’re in the city for a longer stay and you don’t mind a bit of paperwork, you can apply to use EcoBicis, a free public bike system with numerous stations across town. Another place worth visiting is the National Congress located on the western end of Avenida de Mayo. This building is home to the legislative branch of government and it’s quite impressive when you get up close. Alfajores are kind of like cookies that have been glued together with dulce de leche. We started out by trying alfajores artesanales, which are hand-crafted. Some alfajores were glazed, others were coated in almonds, but all of them were delicious. For something a little different, we then hopped over to Havanna. While this brand mass produces alfajores, they are known for their quality and unique varieties. We ordered an assortment off their menu including dulce de leche, merengue, chocolate mousse, coffee, quince jam, nuts, and more. Last but not least, don’t forget to check out the city’s entertainment district. If you’re not sure what to watch, just walk along Avenida Corrientes where there are plenty of tango shows, comedy sketches, and stage performances on offer. And that's a huge wrap for our Buenos Aires City Guide. We really enjoyed showing you around one of our favorite cities in the world, and we hope that this video offered a bit of inspiration in terms of things to do, foods to eat, and activities to try on your visit. As always, if you have any suggestions of other fun things to do in Buenos Aires, please feel free to share those in the comments section below. Until next time! So good afternoon from the town of Cachi. Today we took a side trip from Salta. So we left really early in the morning. We were up at seven thirty and we drove through lots of different landscapes actually. Getting to Cachi involves going through jungle, desert, gorges. And there was a fourth one that our guide mentioned that I can't seem to remember at the moment. But either way it was really scenic. We just arrived at the town. We had a nice lunch. So yeah, we're going to go for a little tour I think. We actually don't have a lot of footage today because someone decided to get a little bit sick on Valentine's Day over here. What happened? The altitude wasn't so great today. It hasn't been an issue up until now but today your heart was racing. You had a little bit of an accident outside of the van. I puked on a mountaintop. Yep. But anyways, we don't really to talk about that. Let's just keep showing you the town. You're feeling better now and that is what is important, right? I'm much better. Yes. Let's enjoy the rest of the tour. How about it? Yes, that sounds good. (Banging drum and singing) Always filming, always filming. Oh, you're sweet. Oh, look at you. You have a few scars on your face. You've been getting into fights, haven't you? Haven't you. Haven't you. So Sam it looks like today we're getting the extra long version of the tour. Yeah, our bus is broken down in the middle of the road. Now we're just waiting for basically a rescue bus to get back. Yes, waiting in the desert. Yep, surrounded by cacti. We do have some pretty nice views though so it is not all horrible. So this isn't ideal terrain for a game of hide and go seek but we can play let's imitate the cacti. Oh, yeah. So we made it down the mountain and I think our mission has turned from sightseeing to just getting back to Salta. Yeah, let's just get back to Salta. We still have something like eighty kilometers but I feel like the hardest part of our journey is now over. Yes, we haven't made any of the touristy stops we were supposed to make on the way back. It's a survival journey. Survival today. Good way to put it. Yep. On Valentine's day. So good morning from somewhere in the province of Salta. Today we're doing another day trip. So we left the city behind and we're driving towards a place called Cafayate. Right now we're just making a little pit stop. A little breakfast stop. So we just ate some alfajores, had some coffee. Oh, they were so good. So good. Double layer alfajores. Oh, yeah. There was so much dulce de leche on them. So yeah, we're just going to continue with the drive over and we're going to be stopping at a National Park to see some cool stuff. And they are calling us over because we're leaving. We're leaving. Alright, so we have made it to the National Park and our first stop is the amphitheater. Now apparently this place has 70% of the acoustics that you get in Theatre Colon in Buenos Aires. That is not too bad, huh? Pretty good acoustics. Are you going to test out your vocals here? Lalalala. Lalalala. Let's leave that to the professions. Alright, so I think it is easy to guess where we are right now? Can you guess where we are? A vineyard. Yes, so after a scenic drive we finally arrived in Cafayate. And now we're doing a vineyard tour. And the best part of this is going to be when we get to sample the wine. Lots of wine. Yeah. So you are having your first glass of Torrontés. Yes, and they told me to swirl it around ten times before trying it so I think I'm well above ten at this point. Maybe twenty. Ten times. That's quite the method. Nice and fruity and little bit dry too. So this is church wine that you're drinking right now. This is used in mass. Yeah, I usually don't associate church and wine together but this one is really sweet. It has a bit of a honey aftertaste. So we have a bit of a shopping stop here at the local market. And someone found a gaucho hat. I've always wanted to be a cowboy. Not just any cowboy. A gaucho cowboy. Alright, let's see if the hat fits. It kind of does. A bit of a gringo cowboy. But...hahaha Okay, so the cowboy needs his ice cream for dessert. Yes, and this is not just any kind of ice cream. This might look like strawberry and maybe walnut. But oh no no this is not that.. This over here is wine flavored ice cream. Malbec. And this is a local fruit called Cayote. So I'm going to try them both. Is it like a creamy milk ice cream or like gelato? It is more like a gelato. Even a little bit more watered down than that. But yeah, you do taste the wine. It's refreshing. Now let me try this one. This one might be more milky. Yeah, it is. This one is sweeter and it has that kind of a. I would describe it as kind of honey taste with a bit of kind of pulpy string. And I think it also has walnuts. Yes, it also has walnuts too. So do you have a favorite? I like the sweeter one. I like the cayote one a bit more but the wine one is also pretty refreshing. So we're coming to the end of our trip. This is actually on the drive back. Right now we've pulled over at the three crosses look out point. So let us show you the views. Yes. And this actually is our final stop. We're now going inside the Devil's Throat. That should be a frightening experience. Okay, so final thoughts on Cafayate and the Calchaquies Valleys before we get back on the bus. Yes, so this was actually a really relaxing tour. Which was fantastic because tonight we are taking a night bus to Cordoba. So we got to see a lot today but the pace was very relaxed. We had a lot of time to kind of chill. Lots of wine, lots of cheese. Lots of wine, lots of good food. So now it is time to have a siesta on the bus. Sounds good to me. So today we are taking a little bit of a day trip. We've left behind Villa General Belgrano and we're going to visit a little village called La Cumbrecita up in the Sierras. And this is where I went to school as a child. So it is going to be really fun walking around and showing you around. Well, welcome to my primary school. This is where I went to grade 1 through grade 6. Except, at the time the building was a lot smaller. We did not have this whole wing. It was just this. Just that. And in the morning it was primary school and in the afternoon it was high school. So it was a very short school day - 4 hours. And I had recess twice during those four hours. So, not bad for a kid. Tip top education there, yeah. I think you have a little bit of work to be done. Not too much. Gandolf! So this is a popular spot on a hot summer day. Yes, apparently it is called La Oja. And everyone has seemed to gather here. There is a little mini waterfall. Yeah, you can go for a swim. Are you going to jump in, Sam? I don't think so. No swimming trunks today? No. That's too bad. So next up we're heading to the waterfalls and we can hear that off in the distance. But I want to show you these really cool roots first. It is like this weird web running straight across here. Follow me. Don't trip. Don't fall! How cool is that. That's very cool. Very cool. And little spooky. So we had a minor miscalculation. When you look at this sign how far do you think the waterfall is? 25 feet? 25 meters? That's what we thought. But once we started walking we realized, wow, this is like quite far. 25 feet we're not there. 25 meters we can't even hear it. It's 25 minutes. Minutes. So now we know better for the next attraction. Okay, so Sam now you have visited both Villa General Belgrano, the bigger town, and La Cumbrecita. So what are your impressions so far? Well, I like them both. This particular town I like even more though. It kind of reminds me of the town where I grew up in. It's a bit smaller. And what I really like about this place that is so cool is that it is a pedestrian only town. That's awesome. You drive in your vehicle or in your bus, you get off and then the rest of it is just walking. You don't have to worry about vehicles or anything like that. You're also higher up in the mountains and you experience nature a little bit more here. So that is what I really love about this place. And it is so peaceful. It is. Can you hear the birds chirping? I can hear the birds chirping off in the distance. Chirp, chirp, chirp. Well, welcome to Germany. Or should I say the Germany of South America. Today we're visiting a town called Villa General Belgrano which has very German roots. Like walking around here you're almost feeling like you've been transported back to Bavaria. And this is a town that I'm very familiar with because I actually grew up in a local village that was only 30 minutes away from here. So we're going to be taking a little tour of the town. I'm excited to show Sam around. And maybe we'll try a few German delicacies. Some beer, pastries, who knows. We'll see what is on the menu. So this is kind of a cool sign because it shows all of the different festivals that happen here throughout the year. And we have a Christmas fair, an Alpine chocolate festival, a Viennese pastry festival and also Oktoberfest. Oktoberfest. Where they drink beer in their giant pints. Prost! So it is early evening now. About 7 or 7:30 pm and we're visiting a little craft market in the town. And they have a lot of really strange and unique things here. Like we've seen dinosaurs, you buy mate, you can jewelry, musical instruments. It is just very artsy. I'm seeing lots of fairies as well. I bet you're wondering if they are real or not. Oh yeah, that is what I've been pondering all day. Hello there little magical elf. Are you a good elf or a bad elf? I don't talk to nobody. So we are now in the ecological park. Yeah, and it is just like a turnoff from the main strip. It is amazing how within five minutes you're away from the touristy area and you're out experiencing greenery and an escape from the hustle and bustle. Yeah, can you hear the sound of the stream. The sound of nature. So since we're in such a German town that means we have to have a beer, right? Yeah, apparently you get kicked out of the town if you don't have a beer. Oh ho! So yes, we're waiting for our drinks. We ordered Chopp. I'm having a blonde, you're having red. And I'm thirsty. Hmmm, good. Ready for your ice cold craft beer? Rojo! I think it is really funny that you ordered the red beer and you're a red head and I ordered the blonde one. We didn't even mean to do that did we. Haha, the joke is on us. This beer is great. This is local craft beer and it has been really hot today so this is very refreshing. Okay blondie time for your beer. Salut! That is quite nice. And look what we've got here. This is called Carlitos. Nice ham and cheese sandwich. Mmmm. That is real nice. Oh, yeah. Gandolf. Gandolph is in town. Gandolf is in the house. (Bagpipes playing) (Tango singing) Okay, so Argentina is not very cheap right now but there is one thing that is super affordable. And that is...that is ice cream. Ice cream. Ice cream and wine at the current moment are cheaper than water. So we've been eating a lot of that and drinking a lot of wine. And I have one of my favorite flavors here. I have dulce de leche ice cream con brownie. So it has a brownie as well. Brownie chunks in there...oh la lah. Let's get a close-up of that. Look at that ice cream. You know what? The best thing that happened to me today was that the regular dulce de leche ice cream was out because the one with dulce de leche is 10 times better. And I'm having the classic strawberry. Want to try some? Strawberry. So Sam, you've had a couple of days here Villa General Belgrano. What are your impressions of the place so far? Yeah, it's a fun quirky town. Definitely geared towards tourists. Like you said, it feels like it is straight out of Bavaria. It is kind of a bit of a fantasy land. It is fun. I love that it is in the woods. It is near nature. You can go for lots of scenic walks. And I also like that they have really good German food and awesome craft beer.",False,"20170315 - Argentina Travel Guide ≡ƒçª≡ƒç╖ ∩╜£ Top Things to Do in Buenos Aires, Salta, Cachi, Cafayate & Co╠ürdoba!.en.srt"

We made it to Portugal and today is our first day out sightseeing. And our first order of business had to be food of course. So today we're actually trying this. And this is called Pastéis De Nata or Pastéis De Belém. And it is basically an egg custard tart and it looks absolutely delicious. These actually originated over at the Jerónimos Monastery which is just over there. And it was a recipe created by the monks. So it looks like they were good bakers guys. Pretty tasty looking. We picked these up from the original store where they were first produced. And it was absolutely chaos inside. And something that is really cool is that the first time we ever tried these was actually in Asia when we were in Macau. A former Portuguese settlement. Yes, and you can find these in Brazil and Hong Kong. Anywhere where the Portuguese went. Yeah, exactly. But now it is time to add this to our little tarts. Alright, so what we have here is we have a pack of cinnamon and icing sugar. Yes. So that is going to give it an extra sweet kick. Let's sprinkle that on. I've had these before but never with icing sugar and cinnamon so I think it is going to be extra special. The winning combo. Mmmm hmmmm. That's nice. Wow! It's still warm. Fresh out of the oven. And it is really nice. Have a look. I really like this because sometimes when you have an egg tart it tastes like cooked egg. And that is just wrong. Dessert should not taste like egg. But this is like a really nice creamy custard. Very sweet. It tastes like a proper dessert. I'm happy. So in terms of ingredients it is made with egg yolks, milk flour and sugar and it is time for my first bite here. It's a pretty simple recipe but it's 'oh so good.' Mmmm. Oh, that is just amazing. It's so creamy and love the crunchiness on the outside as well. And you're absolutely right. Like this is as freshly baked as it gets. So like I mentioned earlier this recipe originated in the Jerónimos Monastery and this is because apparently monasteries and convents used a lot of egg whites in order to starch their clothes. Don't ask me how this is done because I've never used egg whites to starch my clothes. But apparently this meant that they had a lot of egg yolks leftover and that is how they started baking and created this wonderful recipe which was eventually sold to the pastry shop where we picked up our egg tarts. So we are having the original recipe that the monks came up with here. And price point? So in terms of price point this is about as reasonable as it gets. It was only 1 Euro and 5 cents. And if you want to pick one up you can pretty much go to any bakery in Lisbon or anywhere else in Portugal. And they are addictive. Yeah. So I think you may need to get more than one. Because we gobbled those up in seconds. I probably could have had about 4 or 5 to be honest. So it is lunchtime here in Portugal and today we took the ferry over from Lisbon to Cacilhas. And this is a great place to eat seafood because we're right by the Tagus River and fresh seafood is available at every single restaurant. So we found a local little spot, Sam has ordered Salmon, and I've ordered halibut. So we're waiting for that to arrive and then we're going to show you some Portuguese seafood. So our food has finally arrived so it is time to take a tour of the plate. So have a look here. This is my halibut cooked on the grill and we've got broccoli, carrots and boiled potatoes with olive oil on top. It looks delicious. I'm ready to dig in. Mmmm. Nice fresh halibut. Really juicy and it is so good with the lemon squirted on top. That's a really nice light dish. That's good because I've been snacking all morning so I kind of need a light lunch at this point. But look at that it's nice and golden but still juicy in the inside. Mmm. Really good selection. And I also really like that the food here in Portugal, whenever you order fish, it usually comes with boiled potatoes and lots of veggies on the side. So I feel like I'm being healthy and the flavors are just enhanced when you pour olive oil over top. It's just such a simple recipe but it is so good. Mmmmhhhmmm. You seem to have a monster meal right in front of you. Tell us, what did you get? Yeah, I got the salmon steak. And if you take a look down here you'll notice it is a very thick cut. Um, and I've been having this almost every day since I've arrived in Lisbon so this is my favorite thing to eat in Portugal for sure. I know, it is so good that we can't get sick of it. And look at the size of that steak. It's massive. It almost takes up the whole plate. So the only difference between our two plates is that you had the steamed or boiled vegetables and I have like a little garden salad over here. So that's nice a healthy. So that has onions, carrots, a little bit of cabbage, lettuce and tomatoes. But this is the reason I came here and took the ferry across the river. For fresh fish. Fresh fish. This is my first bite here. Oh, it looks like I can see a little bit of a bone. Mmmm. Well, was it worth the ferry ride over? Yeah. That's good. Glad to hear it. So these are two staple items that you'll find at every Portuguese table. Yeah, you're going to find white wine vinegar and you're also going to find olive oil. And that is also what the fish is cooked with. And then it is garnished with a bit of salt. So really simple ingredients but a really delicious taste. Well, I would say this is a sign of a spectacular meal. Nothing left! We polished that off! We polished that off. Completely. Well, we couldn't leave the restaurant without having dessert because we just love our sweets so much. So I got something called bolo brigadeiro. And it is a chocolate cake with chocolate sprinkles and it looks oh so decadent. Mmmmm. Oh yeah. It's like a nice and fluffy cake but it is also a little moist. I don't know what they've put in it but it is really nice. Not sharing! Go away! Little Miss Greedy Guts over here. And so as not to be left out I got something as well. Check it out down here. Fancy! Fancy coconut ice cream. Is that a real coconut or is it like plastic? Yeah, feels like it let's see. Sounds like a coconut. Coconut ice cream. See if it tastes like one. Is that chocolate in the middle? Could be. Mmmm. Oh, that is so rich. That is such rich coconut ice cream. I love it. Well, I have to admit it was a bit of a pricey meal. It came to about 34 Euros but I think we went a little bit overboard with the wine and the coffee and the dessert and I don't know what else we got. So yeah, if you just got a main and a beverage it would come to about 20 to 25 Euros, so something to keep in mind. And another way you can shave down the price a little bit more is for someone to order a main, like a fish main, and then the other person to order a small soup and a small salad because those are about a third of the price of an actual fish dish. So for today's lunch video we're eating one item alone. We are trying Bacalhau which is dried salted cod and this is a fish that is very popular here in Portugal. Now the cod used to be salted because that is the method of preservation that they used before refrigerators were widely available so that meant fish became really hard and salted. And then once you actually wanted to cook it you had to soak it in water just to remove a bit of the salt and also soften it again. And that is a food tradition that has been passed down. So today we are trying three different items. If you want to have a look here. All prepared with cod - Bacalhau. Oh la la. We've only got three things to taste here but apparently there is a saying ""That you can make Bacalhau 365 days a year using a different recipe or a different technique."" So since I'm being a gentleman over here I'll let you choose the first of the three to try. Well, I'm going to choose Bolinhos de Bacalhau. And we actually have two of those so no problem. We each get one. So this is actually a little cake made with cod fish. It's a savory cake not a sweet cake. Um, it is made with mashed potatoes, fish, parsley and egg. And it is deep-fried. Let me show you the inside. So you can really see the fiber of the fish in there. Yeah, you can. It's been rolled into a little ball so it looks good. That's a monster bite you took. I'm hungry. That's quite nice. So these little fish cakes can actually be served as an appetizer before a big meal but because we've been kind of overdoing it with the big restaurant meals today we're having something smaller so it is just going to be a little bit of a snack but I think filling enough. Alright, I'm also quite hungry as well. I went for a really long jog this morning and I had a tiny breakfast so I'm ready for my big bite. Have you ever had a fish cake pasty before? Yeah, I have I'm just trying to remember where it was. I honestly can't remember. And the neat thing about this is that of course you taste the fish but it's not overpowering. It's definitely like a pastry as well too. So next up we're trying this. This is a Portuguese empanada. And it is quite different from the ones I've had in Argentina which are usually half moon shaped. This is more like a little miniature pie. And apparently it is stuffed once again with cod fish. So I've never had a cod fish empanada before. Let's see. Yeah, that's pretty unique. What does it look like inside? Have a look in there. I think there is more than fish in there to be honest. Perhaps potatoes. So it looks like and tastes like cod fish, potatoes and maybe even a little bit of spinach. It's really nice. And last but not least. Well something had to be picked last so let's try this one. So this is something that we just saw on the counter and like hey that's cod. Let's try it. Mmmm. This is my favorite one. You know what this one tastes like? It tastes like cod fish Korean jeon. It's like the Korean pancakes. It is really crispy and really tasty. This is awesome. You're going to like this one. So is that battered fish or is it breaded? Yeah, it is battered. Or is it just fried? It's battered and fried and crispy on the outside. Alright, so now it is time for a price point for those little snacks made out of Bacalhau. Yeah, we picked up those four tasty little treats for 6 Euros total. And what was wonderful is that we just took them to this nice little park which is a two minute walk from our Air BNB and enjoyed eating them in the shade.",False,20170213 - Portuguese Cuisine - An introduction to Portuguese food guide.en.srt

Can't wait to eat and travel. So it is a beautiful day out. We have blue skies and I think that calls for a sailing trip. Hi! Good morning. Ready to go sailing? Yeah, absolutely. I think I might even going swimming too. Oh ho. Living the life. Living the life. Horn tooting. Much better. Much better. That is a little better. Hahaha. Two, three. So how is the vino blanco Audrey? Delicioso. Salut! So it is lunchtime here on the boat. What are we starting with? Yeah, so we're starting off with an appetizer. We've got mussels and they've been drenched in a little bit of olive oil and there is some garlic and onions so I can't wait to try this. Look at that thing of beauty. I'm just going to go in. These are fresh. Yeah, that is delicious. Like so juicy and so good. So lunch is served and we are having Fideuà on the boat so have a look here. This is a seafood dish and it is made with pasta that is cooked in fish juice and we've also got some prawns. So it is looking tasty. Look at the massive prawns though. I know. My gosh I can't wait to try this. I'm so nice to let you go first. Mmmmm. What a nice husband. That is so good. Wow. It tastes like seafood. Back on the mainland. I'm feeling tanned and sun-kissed. How about you? Yeah, that was awesome. It was so cool just going out in the sun. We've been in cold weather climates for a while and we had an epic meal. Sam's looking like a lobster. I am. I'm getting properly sunburned over here. Adding to the freckle collection. So next up we're at La Vinyeta and this is a winery and a vineyard so we're going to be drinking some wine and doing a little tour and we're rocking some pretty cool hats. It is going to be hard to give this one away you know. So Sam has found a new career here in Costa Brava. What are you going to do? They're putting me to work here. So I'm going to pick grapes and I'm going to try it over here. Alright, so first step we actually have to try the grapes to see if it is sweet enough. Let's make sure it is sweet. Is it ready or is it too sour? No, it is actually really sweet. It is wonderful. Excellent. Let's go for it. So I'm holding it here, I'm clipping here so as not to like slice off a finger. Alright. And into the bucket. Okay, so I'm not actually picking them. I'm just eating them. But don't tell anyone. Shhhh. That sounds like you. You would do something like that. They're nice and sweet. Like they're little grapes. Lots of seeds inside but super sweet. So good. So I'm going to be stomping some grapes this afternoon in order to do so I need my traditional Catalan hat, Catalan scarf. Now I'm ready to do this and we're going barefoot. Quick correction. That was not a scarf. That was a belt. I'm wearing it around my waist. So Sam tell us what are you about to drink? I'm trying the grapes that you stepped on. With my bare feet. Without even. You're not evening paying me to do this. I can't believe I'm willing to do it without being bribed. I'm getting one for you too. What? Let's try it. That's actually really good. Very sweet. Well, I can't think of a better way to finish off this vineyard tour than with wine, cheese and cold cuts. You know what, we earned this. We helped pick grapes, we helped crush them. No, but that was actually an awesome wine tour. Vineyard tour because that is the first time we actually got to do those things before. Yeah. Normally they just have you walk around the property, they talk all about the place but this was more of an experiential kind of thing and I really really appreciated that. Now it is time to taste the wine. Oh, that is awesome. That is real full body red and I've got some cheese to help wash it down. So tonight we are spending the night in a place called la Ferreria and this hotel is like traveling back in time. I'm going to have to give you a little tour quickly. Before we lose daylight. So tonight for dinner we are having fast food and that has nothing to do with hot dogs, hamburgers or french fries. It is basically food that goes straight from the kitchen to your mouth with as little as handling as possible and the spread looks delicious so let's go get started. So this morning we are up very bright and early for something super exciting that I've never done before. Yeah, we're taking a hot air balloon ride and it should be amazing. Like this is something we've never done and we really want to try it out. Yeah, so we're going to be flying over the Pyrenees mountains and it should be spectacular. Let's go. It is happening. Our balloon is almost filled up with hot air. We're going in. And we're going up. Pumped. How are you doing so far? You know what it is surprisingly not so bad. Now it is better. Now it is better. I had a bit of a freak out going up but now it is okay. We're okay now. How you doing Nick? Cheers! Salud! Sam is putting on a brave face for the camera. It is all an act. So we've landed on solid ground and I have to say I've never been so happy to have my two feet back on the ground. What do you think? Sam was a little nervous up there but honestly it was such a peaceful experience. Yeah it was. You don't hear anything and you can just see you know the little towns and villages still asleep so it was pretty cool. I enjoyed it. I'd do it again. I would actually do it again too believe it or not. With a gin and tonic first. Probably. So since we survived our flights and there were no major incidents we get our certificate of completion. It is a pretty cool map. Check it out. I thought that was our captains license to fly it ourselves. No. Gotta earn that one. So this afternoon we're doing a bit of a taste test at el Celler de Can Roca and this is the second highest rated restaurant in the whole world. It should be delicious. So I'm going to have a very unusual cocktail right now. So follow me over here. This looks like chocolate but it is actually grapefruit juice and campari. We have to pick it up very gently so as to not crack the skin. Mmmm. How is that? Bursts in your mouth. It is wonderful. So next up we're going to start the appetizer and this is going to take us a journey around the world. Check this out. I've never seen a meal plated this way. So we have to open this. Fancy. Open up the bow-tie and voila! And there is the world. Look at that. So this afternoon we're going to do a walking tour of Girona and it looks beautiful. It looks really colorful but first up we need to get ice cream because we need our energy for this walk. Okay, so we finally got our ice cream and apparently there is some kind of Game of Thrones reference here. It is called Ma Daurada and that means the golden hand. I don't really watch the show so I'm not sure. Game of Thrones fans please fill us in. I'm sure you'll know. Ta da da. Dun dun dun. Look at that hand. Spin it around. Hello. Hello, hand. Hello. So I'm just going to bite this guys fingers off. It feels kind of weird. Like it really looks like a hand. Hope it doesn't taste like a hand. Mmmmm. Let's see. It is orange inside. Oh wow. Is it fruity? It is kind of like a fruity popsicle. Yeah. Tasty? Mmmm. Blood. Bloody fingers. But it is good. I like it. What is in it? It tastes like mango. Orange and mango Popsicle. That is what we're having today. So this bridge was built by Monsieur Eiffel himself before the Eiffel Tower ever came to be. Ha! Alright, let's go for it. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you guys ready? Ready? Yes. Hahaha. Up. Up. Yeah. Yeah, Audrey. Yeah, yeah. Nice. Hahaha. So that is a wrap from beautiful Costa Brava. I have to say we ate like Kings and Queens while we were here. Yeah, and we got a nice taste of the region in terms of all of the travel activities and things you can do as well. Definitely somewhere we'd like to come back and explore more in-depth. Yeah, so we hope you enjoyed this video and if you have any questions about travel in Costa Brava, Spain just leave them in the comments below. See you next time. Hola y bienvenidos a Madrid. This week we are in the Spanish capital and we are going to show you twenty five of the best things to do in the city. We were beyond excited to come and visit Madrid, after all this is a city renowned for its arts, cuisine, and nightlife. With 10 days to spare, we decided to hit up some of the best sights and attractions and film a guide highlighting ""25 things to do in Madrid"". In this video you can expect everything from lively markets and world renowned museums, to beautiful gardens and Spanish dishes. Now let's find out what the Spanish capital is all about! So this morning we are visiting Real Jardín Botánico which are the Royal Botanical Gardens here in Madrid. And it is a beautiful space, shaded, lots of different plants from around the world. And the place is actually massive so I'm going to show you the map so you can get an idea of how many little gardens you can visit. And we've only covered a fraction of it so far. Yep. Palacio Real de Madrid is one of the largest palaces in all of Europe. Technically, this is the official residence of the Spanish Royal Family, however, they choose to live in a smaller and more modest palace in the outskirts of town. The Royal Palace is open to visitors year round. So another thing you can do at the palace here is check out the changing of the guard. We were here at eleven o'clock and that is when it started. So one thing that we keep noticing about our stay here in Madrid is that they love their gardens and their parks. Right now we are visiting a place called Jardines de Sabatini and again it is just a garden that is located behind the Royal Palace. And it is a beautiful place to visit and there is hardly any tourists here. So I recommend you come check it out. So right now we're riding the cable car over Madrid. It is an eleven minute journey. Two and a half kilometers. And I think we're going to get some great views of the city. La Rosaleda is a massive rose garden located in the west end of the city. Every year during the month of May a contest is held to select the most beautiful rose of them all. We missed the contest by a couple of months, but we still enjoyed wandering through the grounds. Meals were a big highlight during our visit to Madrid, especially gazpacho! Okay, so time for the first spoonful of Gazpacho. Oh ho ho baby. Mmmm. That is so good. It is tangy because of the tomato. It is served cold so it is really refreshing. And this one has a lot more ingredients than salmorejo. So I just put in some chopped bell peppers, green and red peppers. It has also got a bit of onions in there. And it was drizzled with olive oil on top. So it is a great combination on a hot summer day. I'm just going to keep enjoying this over here. It is so good. The Prado museum holds one of the best collections of Spanish art. They have works by artists like Francisco de Goya, Diego Velázquez, and El Greco. Admission to the museum is free in the evenings 2 hours before closing, but you'll need few days to cover everything this museum has to offer. So at the moment we're visiting Parque del Buen Retiro which is one of the biggest parks in the city. And we're just taking a little break in the shade because summer in Madrid feels like someone has turned on the blow-dryer and they're just blowing it all over your body. It is like a wall of hot air hitting you in the face. So, we rest and cool down people. Parque del Buen Retiro is a massive park in Madrid. It has beautiful boulevards for strolling, a large pond where you can rent row boats, and plazas with trees that will make you feel like you've stumbled into Alice in Wonderland. One attraction you shouldn't miss when visiting Parque del Retiro is the Crystal Palace. It's a beautiful building that streams in natural sunlight, and on occasion they host contemporary art exhibitions. Palacio de Velázquez is also located in the same park. It has red-brick-and-tile architecture, and inside you'll fine temporary exhibitions organized through the Reina Sofía museum. So if you're in Madrid during the summer months you can check out this book fair which is located just behind the Botanical Gardens. Cuesta de Moyano is a little hill lined with book stands and you can pick up literature ranging from philosophy to fantasy, all for a couple of Euros. We couldn't come to the capital and not try Spain's national dish: paella. Okay so your mixed Paella has arrived. Tell us about it. Yeah, the paella is finally here. So the mixed paella has a whole bunch of different things. Let's take a look down at it. So you can see that there is chicken, we've got shrimp, we've got other kinds of seafood, we've got peas. Let's take the first bite here. This is my favorite Spanish food. The thing I like about it so much is that you have all of these different ingredients and it just has such a flavorful sauce on top of the rice. It is just so good. Well, we certainly polished that off. So now let's talk about the price. Yeah, that was nice and filling. So in terms of price it can vary widely. In more expensive, kind of like gourmet restaurants that really specialize in it, we've seen it go up to thirty or thirty five Euros. We've never actually ate somewhere like that. The place we went to was eleven Euros and we thought it was a really good value. We're both really full now. And I've also seen it as an appetizer in some smaller types of restaurants. And you can expect to maybe pay seven or eight Euros for that. So next up we've going to visit the Temple of Debod. Which is an ancient Egyptian Temple that is here in Madrid. And now it wasn't stolen by the Spaniards. It was actually given as a gift because they were building a dam in Egypt in the same area where the temple used to be located. And it was at risk of flooding. So it was given as a gift in order to preserve it. And it is actually a really popular place to watch the sunset and there is lots of people hanging out here so we're going to show you a bit of that. Here we are visiting the home of Real Madrid football club. Easily one of the most famous teams in the world, not just in Spain. And we're going to take a little walk around outside. And you have a new hat to represent. I just did buy one of these. Santiago Bernabéu Stadium is home to the Real Madrid Futbol Club. This is one of the most popular football teams in the world with a huge fan base. So another thing to do in Madrid is actually go out and experience the nightlife. So tonight we're out having a nice little drink. I've got Tinto de Verano. Sam's got Sangria and I do have to warn you the nightlife in Madrid does get started pretty late. We're out right now at like nine thirty and that is super early. Normally people get together past midnight and things keeps going until like four or five in the morning. So, you've been warned. So what have been your first impressions of Madrid's night life? Pulsating, in a word. Hahaha. Recently, we were out with friends and we didn't get back home until about four thirty or five in the morning. Definitely a night to remember. The San Miguel Market is the place to come if you want to sample a wide array of Spanish dishes all under one roof. You'll find everything ranging from seafood to meats and sausages, as well as glasses of sangria and tinto de verano. Plaza Mayor is Madrid's central square and it is lined with little cafes and restaurants. It's a nice place to enjoy a cup of coffee and do a bit of people watching, but you will pay a lot more than you would elsewhere in the city. So it is breakfast time here in Madrid. We've just rolled out of bed at 10 am which is a bit unusual. But we're here at a local cafe and we're going to have a traditional Spanish breakfast. So we have ordered a hot chocolate with churros and porras. So we're going to show you what those are like in just a few minutes. And what are you having? I'm actually having the proper churros. Which is a deep-fried dough. And what I've found interesting is when I've had this in Canada it is more of a dessert but over here in Spain it is a breakfast. And it is a very popular breakfast item. So let's dip that right into the chocolate. Show us how it is done. Break off a piece here. And that hot chocolate is as thick as it gets. It must have some kind of special ingredients that make it especially thick and rich. It is like mud. It is like chocolate sludge. Wow. Let me just say, I could get very used to having this as my normal breakfast. It is that good. So what I find unique about the Spanish churro is the shape. When we had these in South America they were usually like long little strips. And also there is no filling in these. I still haven't come across any Spanish churros that have filings. Whereas in South America they were stuffed with chocolate, vanilla pudding, dulce de leche. So that is another difference. Now let's dip this. Oh la la. This is so good. It is like a wishbone. Puerta del Sol means Gate of the Sun and it is one of the busiest spots in Madrid. It's a great spot to do a bit of shopping, catch a street performance, and then grab a quick bite. La Almudena is a catholic church which sits directly across from the Royal Palace. The church is open to visitors free of charge, but a small donation is suggested to upkeep the building. Right now we're visiting the Oriental Plaza, which is right by the palace. It is a nice kind of scenic area to walk. And you can see all kinds of plants from Asia. So it is time for another breakfast here in Madrid. Today we are having the madrileño which is the local breakfast that everybody likes to eat in the city. And if you look down here you'll be able to see this is Tortilla. Which is a potato and egg type of dish. So it is kind of like a potato and egg omelette. And it is delicious. It comes with a side of bread. And I can't wait to dig in. Oh la la. It is so good. So good. This is your favorite breakfast. It really is. I've been eating it daily. And on my birthday I had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. That is how much I like it. The Queen Sofia museum focuses on 20th-century art. It forms part of the Golden Triangle of Art, which also includes the Prado and the Thyssen. You can also visit Thyssen-Bornemisza, an art museum in the city that was once the second largest private collection in the world. Final thoughts on your time in Madrid. Well, I really enjoyed the city. And I really found that it is super walk-able. We were here for 10 days and we hardly had to take the metro at all. We just took the bus once when we were visiting the stadium but the rest of the time we were able to walk wherever we needed to go. And also I think it is a great city for art lovers. There are so many galleries and museums to check out. And a lot of them are free in the evening. So keep that in mind. And now it is your turn. What did you think of Madrid? You know what? I absolutely loved Madrid. It is a city that just really clicked with me. We have a lot of friends that are living here long term and prior to coming here I had no idea like why would someone want to come to Madrid? Now I totally get it. I love the culture, I love the food, I love the nightlife. Everything is really cheap. I go to the grocery store and I can get a one liter thing of wine for just over a Euro. It is just a really affordable fun city to be in. And it is somewhere I hope I have a chance to come back to again soon. And that is a wrap of our time in Madrid! We had a splendid time and were truly sad to say goodbye to the city, but that just means we'll have to come back again. If you have any travel tips for Madrid, feel free to share those in the comments below. And once again, for more city guides and travel videos, be sure to subscribe to our channel! This week we are exploring another Spanish city. We are in Barcelona and this video is going to highlight 25 things to do here. Barcelona! After a few days in the Spanish capital, we headed over to Catalunya to see what this popular seaside city has to offer. We ended up discovering an eclectic mix of funky architecture, distinct neighbourhoods, and stretches of golden beaches. It was vibrant, it was stylish, and it was addicting. Here's a look at what we got up to during our visit to this world class city: It wouldn't be a proper visit to Barcelona without going to the beach at least once, so first things first, we headed down to Barceloneta Beach, which is popular with locals and travelers who don't want to trek out too far in search of waves and sandy shores. The sun was out, the water was inviting, and the beach was packed. Chilling like a villain. I hope the door is planning to close soon because we are about to take off. Here we go. Oh ho ho. Next up we took the cable car to Montjuïc for a look at the city from above. It was a brief journey, but it gave us a great perspective of how spread out Barcelona really is. So we just finished riding the cable car. And now we have arrived on top of Montjuic. Which is a hill located in Barcelona. You get some great views of the city and they also have a lot of different attractions here. So first up we're going to visit Castell de Monjuic which is an old fortress here atop the city. So we've got our tickets. Let's go in. Over the years the Castell de Montjuïc has played many roles including military fortress, prison, and now, a museum. Seriously guys, you've got to come here early in the day. There are sections of this place that we have all to ourselves. Park Güell is not your average park. This outdoor space was designed by Antoni Gaudi, and as such, it makes you feel like you've tumbled down the rabbit hole and suddenly set foot in the world of Alice in Wonderland. Inside the park you can admire the serpentine mosaic benches, a colonnaded pathway that seems to attract lots of performers, and a colourful salamander made of broken tiles. So up next we are going to visit one of the most iconic churches in all of Barcelona. This is Sagrada Familia and it was designed by Antoni Gaudí. And this church has actually been under construction for decades. I remember I visited about 8 years ago and it was still under construction. There was drywall everywhere and bags of concrete. And that hasn't changed. You can still see the cranes in the background so we're going to show you that in a second. Right now we're visiting Barcelona football club. One of the most famous teams in the world. And I just picked up a hat. And let me tell you that is the most crazy team store I've ever seen. Right now it is the off-season, so unfortunately we can't watch a football game but there are stadium tours. And if you want to get merchandise you get into that fan store because it is absolutely packed. So next up we're about to enter Mercat de la Boqueria which is one of the most popular markets in the whole city. And you can get food to go or maybe some fresh produce, some healthy juices. So we're going to take a walk through. Whether you want to enjoy some tapas or pick up some fresh produce to take away, this market is not short of options. La Rambla is probably the busiest street in the whole city. This tree-lined, pedestrian only boulevard, stretches for 1.2 kilometres and is packed with street performers, food vendors, and pop-up souvenir shops. If there's one thing to love about seaside cities, it's that they always have lively boardwalks, and Barcelona proved to be no different. There were joggers, skateboarders, bikers, and rollerbladers. And if you needed a break in the shade, there were lots of benches where you could kick back, relax, and enjoy the views of the marina. As you head down the boardwalk, you can also swing by the Museum of Catalan History which seeks to make Catalan history more accessible to the public. So this morning we are exploring the neighborhood of Barri Gotic. This is a pretty cool area because they have a lot of narrow little lanes, courtyards, plazas. So you can just go and explore without much of a plan and see what you stumble upon. The Gothic Quarter truly is a beautiful neighborhood to wander on foot. The twisting lanes can make it seem a bit confusing, but you never know what you're going to discover around each bend. While wandering around the Gothic neighborhood you can check out the Gothic market. It has a lot of different antiques and flea market types of items. In the neighbourhood you'll also find Barcelona Cathedral, which is a Gothic cathedral that was constructed between the 13th and 15th centuries. Santa Maria del Pi is another nearby church. Artists like to set up shop in the square right outside the church, so you can also browse some of the artwork on your way out. Like a lot of European cities Barcelona also has a triumphal arch. And what is cool about this place is that it is a really open space and you can see a lot of people just walking around. It is kind of a good place to just hang out and have a leisurely stroll. Casa Batllo is one of Gaudi's architectural masterpieces. The facade is covered in beautiful mosaics, and the balconies have a skeletal quality that also make you feel like you're going to a masked ball. Casa Mila, also known as La Pedrera is another work by Gaudi. The building has an organic and curvy exterior, and unique twisting chimneys with human characteristics. Gaudi gets a lot of the attention in this city, however, Barcelona was home to many other influential architects including Josep Puig i Cadafalch who designed several local buildings including Casa Les Punxes. If you find yourself in Montjuic, you can also consider visiting one of the parks and botanical gardens found on the hill. We chose the lesser known Laribal Gardens, and it was a nice little retreat. The idea for the Miro Foundation came from Miro himself, who wanted to create a space where young artists could experiment with contemporary art. Just a few streets down, you'll find the National Art Museum of Catalonia (MNAC for short), which showcases a mix of church paintings and Catalan art from the 19th and 20th centuries. Then just down the steps from the museum you'll find the Magic Fountain of Montjuïc. We made the mistake of visiting in the daytime, but it's at night when it really shines in a colourful display of lights. Also, if you're planning to be in Barcelona for a while, you can consider signing up for their bike sharing system which makes it super easy to get around the city. Wax museums have popped up all over the world, and in Barcelona's you can pose next to Spanish celebrities and royalty. The Palace of Catalan Music is a concert hall where you can catch performances that range from classical to Catalan song. Definitely one for the music lovers. It is kind of hard to believe our time in Barcelona has expired. So final thoughts. Well, it was a really fun city to visit. Great architecture, really nice beaches. It is very lively especially at night. The only downfall is that we were here in the middle of summer so it was super hot and super crowded and sometimes that made it a little bit difficult to enjoy. Especially at midday or in the mid-afternoon. So keep that in mind. Maybe consider visiting in the springtime, fall, winter. Well, so what did you think of the city? It is definitely a fun city. We had a lot of fun going to the beaches. One thing that is really different about this city compared to some other European cities though is that it is really spread out. In order for us to visit all of these different attractions we had to chunk them together into groups to visit them day by day. Overall, it was a decent city. It didn't quite click with me the same way that Madrid did. But that is just personal preference I suppose. And that is a wrap for Barcelona! Our 5 days in the city flew by, and while this guide didn't cover everything, we hope we were able to give you a feel of what this fun seaside city has to offer. As always, if you have any suggestions of things to do around town, feel free to add them in the comments below. And if you want to catch our latest travel videos, don't forget to hit subscribe! Well Hello, So today is July 23rd. Which means it is my birthday! So Sam and I are going to take a little day trip. We've been staying in Madrid but Toledo is only thirty minutes away by train. So we're going to head out and have some birthday adventures in a new city. We've arrived and it is a beautiful train station. Time to get the birthday girl some lunch. Yes. So we decided to walk into the city which was maybe a mistake considering it is almost forty degrees out. We should have just grabbed a taxi but at least they have these escalators that help you reach the summit of the center of the old town I guess. So yeah, it is nice being in the shade and not having to climb stairs. It is kind of funny because just outside of the escalators are these old ruins. So you have something very modern and then you have the ruins right beside it. Yeah, quite the contrast. So we made it to the top. And this is our reward. Check out these views. Birthday girl, what is your starter? Alright, so we found a nice little restaurant and I've ordered Gazpacho which is a cold tomato soup with onions, peppers and cucumbers. But you can't see any of that because it looks like they've just liquefied it and turned it into a bit of a cream. But let's try it. Mmmmm. Refreshing? That is so refreshing on a day like today. And it is a little bit tart and tangy which I really like. I could drink this out of a glass it is so good. And what is your entree? I'm trying something I've never tried before. It is called Migas de Pastor. And if you look down here it has got meat, it has got some kind of breadcrumbs here and it also has veggies. I think these maybe peppers. Let's take a bite with the meat and the breadcrumbs. How is it? It's really good. I think that is a piece of like chorizo meat. Nice! Spicy! And what does the birthday gal have? So I'm having a type of Tortilla which is basically potatoes and egg. Kind of like an omelette style meal. This also has ham in it. And I've got some pork right underneath. They've soaked it in ketchup which I'm not a huge fan of. But it is alright. I actually had this for breakfast today and that was a little bit better. So I see your main dish has arrived. You know what, this is actually my favorite Spanish dish that I've tried since I've been to Spain. It is called Paella. Take a look down here. We're going to be doing a bit more of a dedicated video to this soon but for now you can basically know that it is a mixed type of rice with seafood and vegetables. Alright, let's take a bite of that. So good. It's got a really rich and kind of creamy sauce. I just absolutely love this. And over here in Spain wine is like water. I had a choice between water and wine so I got my own bottle. I think I made the right decision. Aren't you glad we got about a thirty minute break in between our main course and dessert? What do you have? I am having flan. And I don't really know how to describe this dessert except to say that it is popular in South America and in Spain. And your Mom makes a really good flan. Yes, and the brown stuff you see it is kind of like caramelized sugar but I really can't explain the dessert itself because I have no idea what it is made with even though I've eaten it my whole life. That's good. Alright, and I have one of my all-time favorites. Arroz con leche. This is a rice pudding and unlike you I can explain what is in it. There is milk, there is rice and there is cinnamon. And you know who makes a good rice pudding - my Mom too. Let's take a bite. I'll stir that cinnamon around a bit. It's really good. It is really creamy. I can tell they've used like maybe even a cream instead of a milk. Nice. And lots of sugar and cinnamon. So is it served hot or cold here? Ah, cold. Nice. So we are now visiting the Alcázar, which is the one building that dominates the city skyline. And they also have a really cool military museum. And normally I wouldn't be into that but because it is so hot outside it has actually been really nice being indoors with AC. Just learning a bit of the history by force. I'm beginning to realize that Spain is more of a winter destination. All we've been doing since we've come here is sweating like pigs. So we are hiding indoors again. We found a little corner store with lots of fans and Popsicles. So trying to cool down here people. So I think that is about all we can handle for today. So cooling off yet again with ice cream cones this time. And now we're going to head back to the train station and try to get back to Madrid a little bit earlier than planned.",False,20170201 - Visit SPAIN Travel Guide ∩╜£ Best things to do in Spain.en.srt

This is something that piqued our curiosity, so we devoted a whole morning to cave-hopping around the area. So we have another fun day planned in Meteora. Today we're going around and visiting caves. And now there is a lot of different caves. Earlier in the morning we visited some that were used kind of like to keep farm animals, sheep and goats because they were very accessible and at a lower level. And right now we're visiting caves that were used by hermits and that means monks who wanted to be secluded and just live a very quiet simple life on their own. So these monks in Meteora were extreme adventurers in my opinion. They wanted the caves that were really high up and could not be reached by others so that they could be in isolation on their own. So in order to reach these caves they would have literally had to scale using their hands the first time. And then use ropes and ladders to reach them later on. The monks eventually built monasteries, but don't let that fool you into thinking they were any easier to access. Reaching the top involved a lot of bravado and a whole lot of upper body strength. Next up we're going to be climbing the Holy Spirit Rock which is right behind us. This isn't going to be rock climbing. Apparently there is a trail around the other side so let's go follow our guide because he is already leaving without us. In the afternoon we set our sights on the Holy Ghost Tower which sits in the middle of the valley. It was a good challenge and we were rewarded with some pretty breathtaking views from the top, but my favourite part was walking down the other side and coming face to face with a cave that once acted as a jail for monks! We've been climbing up The Holy ghost tower and right now we've reached a little chapel inside a cave. So let's go have a look. 360 views from the top. This is our reward for climbing Holy Spirit Tower. Fresh pomegranate! Mmmm. And it is delicious. So refreshing. So right now we are standing at the mouth of what I'm calling the naught monks cave. This was basically like a jail so if a monk was misbehaving he would be sent here and they had fourteen different ledgers which were basically like prison cells where the monks would be placed in isolation. So let's go inside and have a look. Team Greece! Woo! Well hello from Greece! Sam and I are currently visiting Meteora which means suspended in the sky. This is a place that is really well known for its monasteries built atop these rocks. And the landscape is usually out of this world but as you can see we are dealing with a bit of fog and rain today. So it is going to be a bit tricky. Um, we were planning to do a bit of hiking actually but I think that is not going to work out so we're going to settle for some monasteries and caves instead. So let's get ready and go. Since the weather wasn't really cooperating we ended up hopping in a van and driving out to some different look out points around Meteora. Everywhere we turned we were greeted with sweeping views of the towns below, impressive monasteries seeming to defy gravity, and imposing rock towers that looked out of this world. The rain did eventually clear up and that's when we went back to our original plan for a hike around Meteora. Okay guys, so we are finally hitting the trails. It's going to be a 10 kilometer hike. So far we've already been seeing ruined monasteries and the landscapes are amazing. So let's continue. We have to catch up with our group. Behind me are some massive boulders which are really popular for rock climbing. We're not really into that so we're just doing a hike today. But if you're into rock climbing you've got to try it over here. The hike was a really easy one and perfect for most fitness levels. Our guide lead us down dirt trails and we learned that there is a network of over 35 kilometers of foot paths in this area. Along the way he pointed out strange rock formations, various mushrooms growing in the forest, and the best part was hearing the tales behind each of the ruins we visited. This is the place where you can taste the echo. Listen! Echo! Woo! It's raining outside, we've got an abandoned monastery in the background and we're going to do our best echoes. Echo! And you? Echo! That was weak. One more time. Echo! Echo! So we've been visiting a lot of different ruined or abandoned monasteries and this is one of them. Now there is a pretty interesting story behind this one. Apparently, monks used to live here and one day they were out who knows doing some gardening or whatever when a group of people came over and they just took over their home. They started squatting and they took control of the monastery for over 80 years. So the poor monks had to find somewhere else to live. Now today this one has been renovated but you can't actually visit it. So we're just admiring it from a distance. Pretty spectacular I'd say. The rain clouds have returned and it is pouring right now. That is the end of our 10 kilometer hike. We're going to go have some lunch, dry up and maybe head out again in the afternoon. by bus. So we'll check out some monasteries later. Okay, so it is still raining but we are going to go visit the biggest monastery here in Meteora. It's called the Grand Meteoron. Low and behold. It's just over there. We've got our umbrellas. Let's go visit it. What's scary? If you look over here you'll notice that this is the old entrance and they used to climb up by latter. That's scary. And lucky for us today you can reach the top by climbing the stairs. Three hundred stairs to the top. But back in the day you would have had to use a rope and basically hoist yourself up or had someone pull you up because you know they were quite secluded and they wanted to keep it that way. So if you wanted to make it here you had to earn it. What I'm going to do over here is light a candle and make a wish. So come and check it out. It better be a good wish. Choose wisely. And, of course I can't tell you what it is. Any tips on visiting here? Yes! I actually do have a tip. So prior to coming to Meteora I would have thought okay let's hop on a bus, we'll reach the monastery. Visit the monastery and that will be it. But if you do it that way you're missing out on so much more because the landscapes here are incredible. So I would recommend doing a hike. Kind of like what we did this morning because then you really get to admire the monastery, see them from a distance. You get to visit caves and also visit the abandoned ruins of former monasteries that are kind of hidden and you wouldn't normally be able to spot if you were on the main road. So something to consider. You can get a bit of exercise and really enjoy the landscapes. It wasn't until our final morning in Meteora that the rain clouds finally cleared and we had blue skies over the valley. Though I have to say, we still loved it even in the rain, and that's the sign of a good visit!",False,"20170109 - Visit METEORA Travel Guide ∩╜£ What to SEE, DO & EAT in Meteora, Greece.en.srt"

Yeah, new country for both of us so that is pretty exciting. First time in Central Asia so we are stoked to be here. Yeah and over the next few days we are going to be horse-trekking in Song Köl so we're going to take you along but before we get there we're making a little stop. First up Burana Tower right here. So we're going to climb to the top. Are you ready? Yes. The first day of our tour was mostly a travel day, so we just enjoyed the scenery, caught up on sleep, and experienced our first Kyrgyz traffic jam. We also go our first taste of Kyrgyz food with a massive lunch featuring all types of spreads and dishes. From there, we did a short hike in the outskirts of Kochkor and then checked into our guesthouse for the night. (Traditional music of Kyrgyzstan) So good morning from Kochkor. We did a home stay here last night which was a lot of fun. We got to watch a music performance and eat amazing food. So we're just going to enjoy breakfast now and then go horse-trekking. And we're wearing our cool hats. Yeah, so can't wait to do that. Let's get started. Yeah. Alright so we just arrived at the first camp. We've had lunch and now we're going to pick out a horse and begin the trek. Yeah! Okay so it is time for a little update. How are you feeling? Hahaha. Well, I've been getting tenderized on that horse. Yeah. Like we've been riding for over three hours now and after I got off of it I could barely stand up. Like I almost collapsed. I almost fell. Obviously we are not trained at doing this but it has been a lot of fun. The scenery has been awesome, the weather has really cooperated so this is over the halfway mark and we're really looking forward to reaching the Yurt for supper. Hello! Hey little guy. Hello! Hahaha. So we made a new friend and we've arrived at camp. We've arrived at last. So we're at our yurt and we're going to eat dinner. We're getting ready for dinner and this guy is our entertainment for the night. Woo hoo! So it is now bedtime. The boys are in one yurt and the girls are in the other and this is what it looks like. Little tour. There we go. And we have loads of blankets because it is freezing cold tonight. Brrr. Hahaha. Good morning. I don't know about you but I slept really well. We were in separate tents. Yeah, it was men only and women only. And it was so cold that you know we just bundled up in these big thick blankets and I think everyone just was like out like a rock. Past out right away. Seriously. And we went to bed early. Yeah because the horse riding took a lot out of us and we had a nice big meal and then a little bit to drink and then just it was fantastic. So this is the start of day two. So we're going to be riding again about five hours today. I'm feeling pretty sore so we'll see how that goes. But it should be fun like the landscapes have been amazing all the way. And the weather has been awesome too so I think we're going to have another really good day. Mmmhmmm. Let's do this. Pup, want to come say hello. Are you feeling shy this morning? It's okay. We can be friends. We were introduced yesterday pup. Oh. Alright welcome to MTV cribs the yurt edition. Yurt edition. So we're going to show you what is going on in here. Alright. This is like the men's sleeping quarters last night so we were all sleeping here. Looks pretty messy. It is properly messy. We all just woke up. We're just getting ready for breakfast and this was the awesome stuff we had last night. We had some vodka. You guys were drinking Vodka? Yep. We didn't get any. What? We were having Vodka and we were having that special milk. Ah, the mare's milk. Yeah, that tasted a bit like alcohol. And you know what I'm noticing? It looks like three of you were cuddling over here. You know what? The three of us shared that little area and then there were two other guys here. So. Yeah, and as you can see. That is how it is when I'm away. And we could have fit a lot more in here too. Yeah. But yeah like just check out the yurt. It is pretty cool. We have natural light coming in in the morning. And yeah, we're going to be staying in a yurt again tonight. I know. Woo hoo! Round two coming up. Okay so we're taking a little break. Time for an update. Tell us about your horse today Sam? Okay, so we went really high today. Like we went up really steep hills and my horse was really struggling. It was like ha ha. It was panting the whole way but even more so it was farting. The whole way up. And guess who was behind. I was. I got to breathe it all in. You got a few whiffs that is for sure. On our second afternoon of trekking we made it to Song Kol, our final destination. We arrived shortly before sunset, so after dropping off our packs and warming up with tea, we made our way down to the water to watch the sun work its magic. Hey pup. Hi pup. Let's be friends. So we finally made it. We arrived. So it is day two. It is the end of our horse-trek and this is Song Kol. Viola! And you know what is funny? They told us we should bring a bathing suit in case we wanted to take a dip. But as you can tell it is freezing cold and there is no way I'm going in to the water but I am going to dip my finger to see you know just how bad it is. One finger. That is all. Ah. You know what I think the air may be colder than the water. Wish you brought your bathing suit? Well, no because it would be pretty brutal when you get out and you have to dry off but this isn't so bad. Greetings from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan! Hello from Central Asia. It is our first time here and we are going to be spending a few days here in the capital. So we're going to take you on a little tour and show you fifteen things to do around Bishkek (Бишкек). It should be fun. First up, we visited Ala-Too Square (Ала-тоо аянты - Площадь Ала-Тоо), which is the central plaza in Bishkek. While there isn’t much to do here, it’s one of the city’s major landmarks, plus they also have lots of benches and water fountains where you can take a quick break. From there, we crossed the street and made our way over to the State Historical Museum. So unfortunately the state museum which you see right here behind me is closed for renovations so we won't be able to go in but I hear there is a statue of Lenin hiding out back so we're going to see if we can find that. Let's go. On an unrelated note if you've never watched the movie Goodbye Lenin you should. It is in German but it is pretty good. I just remembered that because we're visiting the Lenin statue. Another place you’ll want to visit in Bishkek is the Osh Bazaar (Ош базары). It may not be the biggest in Central Asia, but it’s a bustling maze where you could easily spend a few hours. We had no problems at the market, but we were warned by several locals to ignore the fake police who may ask to see documents and camera permits. So keep that in mind if you encounter them! It is shopping time. Next up we're at the Osh bazaar (Ош базары) and you can find everything here. We're seen fresh produce, snacks, chocolates, clothes. Right behind me we have an entire aisle dedicated to dry cheese balls. It is this really popular snack. It kind of tastes like salty goat cheese. Not my favorite but if you want to try it come here. 150. Can I get. Half a kilo of dates. Half a kilo of fresh dates. And I paid just 100 Som which roughly is about a dollar fifty. And like look how many dates I got guys. All for yourself. Because I'm not a fan of dates either. Ah. No. We're not dumb tourists. We're not dumb tourists. Maybe Sam is. Those were Sam's horrible acting skills right there. My goodness. We are going to visit an abandoned casino and nightclub. But you know what? There is a lot of people hanging out here and I feel like we're going to get kicked out because these people look like construction workers or security guards. Anyways let's try. First impressions? It smells bad. I think people hang out here overnight. Yeah, they may hang out here and do things but there is also a lot of broken things all around so I think it is going to be cool. Let's go take a look. I think graffiti as well. Ah yeah, nice graffiti over there. Okay so we just came across children playing in here. So if kids can get in I think we can too. If you do come here I would suggest closed shoes. It is all broken glass. Hello. Hello. Directly across from the abandoned casino, you’ll find Victory monument which was built to commemorate the 40th anniversary of World War 2. The three curved arcs represent a yurt, and the sculpture of a woman standing near the eternal flame is meant to symbolize her waiting for her husband and sons to return from the war. Okay so this morning we are checking out Erkindik Park. And I think this is Sam's favorite park that we've found so far. I've been going jogging here everyday sometimes twice a day. So and I've kind of come at all times of day and on weekdays and also on weekends. And this park is completely different throughout the week. Yeah, you can catch people enjoying coffee or having ice creams in the afternoon. And it is basically like these two little parallel boulevards lined with trees. It is really pretty so we're going to show you. Oh my gosh they have peanut butter. Audrey they have peanut butter. Peanut butter. This is Sam in his happy place. Ice cream and a swing. I'm here on a bit of a solo mission. Out of all the things Iv'e really wanted to do in Bishkek this is right at the top of my list. I'm going to check out a public bath. Woah. That was refreshing. So I just spent probably one or two hours in the public bath. And it was pretty awesome. It reminds me a lot of the Korean public baths in the sense that it is gender segregated. You basically go in, you take off your clothes, you put on some flipflops, you get naked and you go check out these basically steam rooms, there is a sauna. But what was really awesome at this place it had these little hut like buildings over here. That is actually where you do basically your polar plunge swimming. And that is freezing cold water. And when I was going to go in for the first time I was kind of like tiptoeing in with the latter and this guy came by and shoved me in. So I got the full on experience of feeling really cold after being hot for a while. So yeah, it was a pretty cool experience. It cost 300 Som. So not too expensive and if you're in Bishkek (Бишкек) and you're up for this type of thing definitely check it out. So we are going rollerskating in Bishkek. And I don't know how to roller skate. Neither do I. Can't start. Can't stop. I can't roller skate but Sam seems to have picked it up. There he be. It is like Bambi on skates. This is so different from ice skating. So the question is what do you prefer? Roller skating, inline skating or ice skating? Are you kidding me. Of course inline skating and ice skating are way more familiar for me. But I have to say I'm starting to get the hang of it a little bit near towards the end. But I decided to wrap it up a bit early. Those teenagers are just way too agile for me. Yeah, don't want to break any bones today huh? No. Ha. We missed the start of opera and ballet season by just a few days, however, if you’re in the city at the right time, that’s something you could consider doing. Chilling like a villain. He be chilling like a villain. Where are we? And what are we doing? Any why are you making that face? I have no idea. We are at the Q cafe. Right over there. Q cafe. You can't really see it but it is there. This is a place where we met up for coffee with friends like two or three days ago. Yep. And it is really good so we're back again and we've got some beautiful looking lattes. Lattes. With art. And we're just waiting for cake and muffins basically. Cake and muffins. Woo hoo. Dessert is here. Yes, so I'm going to start with this. Sam's cake. It looks crumbly. I think they call it Dvorak cake. Yeah, I didn't get the name. Mmmm. It is like a fluffy cheesecake almost. And it is crumbly. With icing sugar on top. That is nice. Um, I am a fan of your cake Sam. Do you remember whose cake that is? You've just had a second bite. Alright since you're on like a bit of a piggy role why don't you try your muffin. Your muffin. There we go. Is that pumpkin? Ooh. Wow. Oh wow. That is strawberry. Real chunks of strawberry. Mmmm. That is good. With coffee. Perfect midday snack. And if you’re craving a short escape from Bishkek, you can always plan a day hike to the nearby mountains with the Trekking Union. So two funny things. We had to sign a waiver in order to join this trek and there were two particular points that kind of jumped out at us. First, we had to agree that we wouldn't run away during the hike but it is like. You know how much we like to do that so. That was almost a sticking point. Where are we going to run? And number two we had to promise we wouldn't drink alcohol. Haha. But again alcohol on a twenty five kilometer hike. I feel like that is just asking for trouble and we barely have enough water so. In other words we have to dump out the moonshine that is in my backpack, right? Ha. Ah, I got my shoe wet. Now I'm going to be hiking 25 kilometers with soggy shoes. This is not a good start. As far as food goes, there’s plenty to sample ranging from grilled meats to dumplings, and noodles to mixed rice, plus there was one drink that really left an impression on us. So we've decided to be a little bit adventurous with what we're drinking and we are having kymyz (Кымыз). We're having kumis (Кымыз). Do you want to tell us what that is? This is basically considered the national drink here in this country. In fact, the city of Bishkek (Бишкек) was named after the paddle used to churn this and it is basically it is mare's milk. It is fermented mare's milk. And that is all you're having? That little sip. It has a slight amount of alcohol. Sam. Yeah, we're taking it easy here. So. Let's try it. It has a very strong smell. Okay. Well? So imagine like the saltiest milk you've ever had that has also been slightly watered down and tastes a little bit alcoholic. You can taste a little bit of the alcohol. So that is exactly what it tastes like. Mmmm. Mmmmm. And we've got a liter of that just to ourselves. Alright so Sam tell us a little bit about the food here in Bishkek. So we're standing outside a restaurant called Red Cow and this is one of the most popular places to have steak. And what we've found here in Bishkek (Бишкек) is that there is some amazing International Cuisine. We've had really good Japanese, we've had really good Korean, we've also had really good traditional food here as well. So this is a city for foodies. Tonight for dinner we're going to go to one of our favorite International food places. It is called Chicken Star. It is a Korean restaurant that specializes in Korean style chicken. And I'm all ready. I've got my Hanwha Eagles hat on. Alright go team Korea! Woo. Beer has arrived. This one is called Zhivow. But the thing is can you say cheers in Russian. That is the true test. Tell me what it is. I don't know. So no. Gumbai. So we are at Save The Ales. Save The Ales. And I am saving an ale right here. A pale ale. Yeah, an IPA. There is a really cool craft beer scene emerging here in Bishkek (Бишкек) and I can't wait to try this one. With our time in Bishkek winding down, we made a visit to Oak Park which is full of sculptures, and then we also visited nearby Panfilov Park (Панфилов көчөсү - улица Панфилова). So next up we're at Panfilov Park (Панфилов көчөсү - улица Панфилова) and this place if full of rides. We've just had a big lunch so we're debating whether or not we should get on some of these little roller coasters and other things. Oh. And that’s a wrap for our trip to Bishkek (Бишкек). As you can probably tell from this video, this city is the kind of place that you experience as opposed to ticking off attractions, so it ended up being a fairly relaxing trip after a few busy weeks of travel around Kyrgyzstan (Кыргызстан - Киргизия). As always, if you have any suggestions of things to do in Bishkek, feel free to share your tips with fellow travellers in the comments section below. See you next time! Hey guys we're at the World Nomad Games (Дүйнөлүк көчмөндөр оюндары) in Kyrgyzstan (Кыргызстан) and this is basically like the Olympics for Nomadic Games and Culture. So we're going to show you around. We're going to be hear for several days but first the Opening Night Ceremony. Things kicked off with a massive celebration at the stadium, where there was live music, dancing, and even a special appearance by Steven Seagal. The following morning we went up to the jailoo, also known as the pasture, where they had set up a folk village so visitors could wander around and learn about Kyrgyz culture. After catching the opening dance, we set out to visit the various camps, each showcasing a different region. Okay so up next we're heading into a camp that is all about Kyrgyz culture so we're going to be seeing some musical instruments, tapestries, games and maybe even some of the food so let's go do that. So we're seeing lots of food preparation happening across the camps here. Yeah, we sure are. We have locals preparing their own stuff. I think this guy has got a lamb going in the back. And we had a really nice lunch in the food tent. We had Plov with lamb. Basically it is like kind of rice with lamb. Yeah. Really tasty. Yum. Yum. So I think that was probably the strangest competition we've seen so far. Tell us about it. Possibly the most painful. So this guy was basically doing somersaults on broken glass. He lied down on top of it and they put like a kettle ball on his stomach and then a jackhammer came down on it. Like that's gotta hurt man. That was random. Okay guys this is day three of the event and this is the one I've wanted to watch the most. This event is called Kok Boru. Yes, so this is a really popular game in Central Asia and it is actually the National Sport in Afghanistan. And it is basically two teams competing on horses kind of like polo but instead of using a ball they're using a goats carcass. Yeah. And they're tugging at that carcass and we can't wait to show you what it is all about. Yes, definitely interesting. At the end of the match, the winning team gets to eat the goat so the animal doesn’t go to waste. It was also nice to see that some of the winning teams shared their goat with their opponents. That being said, kok-boru isn’t the only horse game at the event. There are also horse races for adults and children alike, as well as a game that closely resembles basketball on horseback, so you can take your pick. Alright, so we're back on the pasture tell us the plan for today. Back to the pasture this afternoon and it looks like we've got some cool kind of sporting events. There is going to be something with eagles and also archery, so we're thrilled to check those out. Hey pup. It is excited. Oh my it is excited. Aside from all that, in the sporting complex they had a variety of wrestling events, that were fascinating to watch. Well sadly it is over. The World Nomad Games (Всемирные игры кочевников) have ended. Yeah, it was quite the event though I mean we've been covering it here for several days and it has been awesome. And now is the closing ceremony so we're going to show you a bit of that. Yeah, so there is going to be a concert happening right over there. And that is going to be the end to the party. So it is lunchtime here in Bishkek (Бишкек), Kyrgyzstan (Киргизия) and today we are going to be having a feast. We are going to be sampling all of the traditional dishes that we've been eating over the last three weeks because that is how long we've been traveling in the country. So we're ordering a big spread. This is probably enough food for like five or six people but Sam and I are going to try and eat it all and just showcase what Central Asian cuisine is all about. So we hope you enjoy. So we've decided to be a little bit adventurous with what we're drinking and we are having kymyz (Кымыз). We're having kumis (Кымыз). Do you want to tell us what that is? This is basically considered the national drink here in this country. In fact, the city of Bishkek was named after the paddle used to churn this and it is basically it is mare's milk. It is fermented mare's milk. And that is all you're having? That little sip. It has a slight amount of alcohol. Yeah, we're taking it easy here. So. Let's try it. It has a very strong smell. Okay. Well? So imagine like the saltiest milk you've ever had that has also been slightly watered down and tastes a little bit alcoholic. You can taste a little bit of the alcohol. So that is exactly what it tastes like. Mmmm. Mmmmm. And we've got a liter of that just to ourselves. The strange thing is I don't know if Sam managed to get some bread crumbs into the milk or if that actually belongs in there. No, that is just how it is. That is just how it is with brown chunks. It has some chunks in there. Brown chunks in the mare's milk. Alright. Hahaha. Arrghh. Bit of an acquired taste? Oh man. It tastes like cheese. Like salty cheese and it is fizzy. This is the one thing that we're trying for this video that is for you guys. I mean we probably wouldn't order this on our own but it is a very important part of the culture here. An acquired taste I'd say. Yeah. We'll leave it at that. Yeah. We're starting our meal with some bread. Yeah. So this is like the traditional Kyrgyz flatbread. And you can find this basically at every meal that we've had here. Bread is like a very important part of the meals. And especially when we were staying in the yurts we were eating this a lot. So let's just dip it in here. A bit of here. It looks like sour cream. Yeah. Mmmmm. Yeah, it comes like a creamy butter actually. It is a little bit sour but not too much. Mmmm. And that bread is really good. You can tell it is homemade and fresh. Aside from the flatbread we also ordered Samsa. So I'm just going to break that open. And our Manti (манты) is coming. Look at this. Oh wow. Look at that. It kind of reminds of an empanada. So you've got like a bread exterior and it is filled with meat and chopped onions. Oh, it looks good. It is nice. How does it taste? It is really savory and peppery. Lots of ground pepper in there. So this is actually a snack that you pick up at a truck stop. It is really popular and it is super cheap as well and really filling. You can also get vegetarian ones. I had one that was filled with potatoes. Next up we got a plate full of manti (манты). It is manti (манты) time. And of all of the Kyrgyz food that basically we've had over the last three weeks this is one of my absolute favorites. It is basically like a steamed dumpling. If we take a look down here I'm going to dissect it here for you. So this one, we ended up getting pumpkin, so I don't know if you can see the orange in here. Oh, look at that. You can see the pumpkin puree in there. Well more liked diced pumpkin. More like diced pumpkin. That is true. So you can get, of course you can get a pumpkin but you can also get all kinds of different ones. Like a lot of the ones that are most popular are actually with meat. Yeah, so there is beef, lamb and you can also get potato. Yeah, so whatever you want to get it is available. Alright, so let's try this. Mmmmm. Oh my. I'm going in for a second bite. Mmmmm. Oh, it is just delicious. Such good dumplings. Like, wow. We were just in Korea not too long ago eating Mandu which was a Korean dumplings and so this is a perfect fit for me. Transitioning from there to here. So I am now moving on to the Lagman (лагман) and this is a noodle dish. Sometimes you can get it as a soup but I opted for the fried variety. I like the fried one the best. I know. This one is really good. So it comes with chopped onions and peppers and we've got some chives and meat. It is a little bit of everything. This is one of your favorite dishes isn't it? Mmmm. One of your favorite Kyrgyz dishes. Yeah, and apparently it has Chinese roots. Chinese origins. So it kind of reminds me a little bit of a stir fry. It is really good. And the beef is so tender oh my gosh. That was good. Wow, it looks like there is a lot of cut up scallions (green onion) too. And the food keeps on coming. It sure does. Next up we're basically trying the fried-rice so if you look down here we have the Plov (плов). Plov or Pilaf. Pilaf (плов) too. It is called both here. And it comes typically with meat so you see some meat here and you also see peppers. It has onions. It has carrot. It has different kinds of seasonings. Dill. It smells nice. Yeah, and it is prepared in a massive cast iron cauldron and what was really cool is when we were covering the World Nomad Games, just behind these like tent type of restaurants you could see it being prepared. And it was just like this massive cauldron. It was really cool. It is a really popular dish. We ate a lot. Really popular dish. We really have. Mmmmm. Yeah, that is really good. It is savory but it is also a little bit juicy with the different peppers. So, a really nice taste. We had nearly forgotten about the Shashlik (шашлы́к) with all of the food at the table but is has finally arrived. And that is kind of embarrassing because really this is the star of the meal. This is what I've been looking forward to the most. So this is your classic skewered meat. This is like super popular in Kyrgyzstan. You can find actually restaurants that specialize in it. And you're classic shashlyk (шашлы́к) restaurant you're going to find like a small little restaurant outside and you'll see a guy out on a grill just whipping up a whole bunch of these. Yeah, like it also a popular street snack. You can buy it on the street. Yep. And typically it is lamb but we have ordered beef. We decided to mix it up and go with beef but the lamb one is delicious. We tried the lamb last time and it was. I'd probably recommend going with that one. So here is the beef one anyways. Mmmmm. Are you getting those smoky flavors? So smokey. It has got a lot of flavors, a lot of salt. It is a really juicy meat. And it reminds me a lot of anticuchos in Peru. Yeah. So if you've tried that in Peru then you have an idea of what this tastes like. Well, except anticuchos are organs and this is actually a really nice cut of meat. That is true. But the taste both of them is awesome. Yeah. And we also got a pot of tea since we weren't huge fans of the mare's milk. We figured we needed something to wash all of the food down. Um but yeah typically at the table the youngest person is in charge or pouring tea for everyone. So if you're having like a big family meal or you're out with friends that responsibility could fall on you depending on your age. And also while we were doing the yurt stays we realized that tea plays a huge role in hospitality here. So when you're a guest one of the first things they do is like offer you tea and they keep filling up your cup until you are about to burst. It is literally the first thing and the second you're done your cup. Like they are ready to refill, right away. The host is on top of it. On top of it. Your teacup is filled up. Hahaha. So how is the tea? It is good. It is green tea. So typically you get black tea when you're in a yurt but we went for green. So we're almost done the meal. Any particular favorites? So stuffed. Um, the shashlik (шашлы́к) was amazing. That was so so good. It was so juicy and they don't really put a lot of spices on the beef but it just has like that natural flavor so that was really nice. It was smokey, tender flavor. Love that. It was good. And also the rice. I'm usually not a very big fan of rice but it was really good. It was like wild brown rice so that was really tasty. Yeah, those are two of my favorites as well. And I'm going to add that I really like the manti (манты). The pumpkin dumplings. Of course. Dumplings. So that wraps up our feast of feasts. It was an amazing like traditional Kyrgyz meal. We ordered so much food that we're actually taking a lot of it home. This is probably enough either for three or four people and in terms of the price it came to one thousand two hundred Som which right now is seventeen US dollars. So that was incredible value. I mean we got three different kinds of drinks, we got tea, we got a liter of Pepsi, we got a liter of mare's milk plus all of that food that we showed you including the bread, the dumplings, the meat, the rice, the noodles. So you can come here and have an epic feast and it is not going to cost you a fortune. Good morning from Kyrgyzstan (Кыргызстан). It is time for a day trip because we've been spending a lot of time at the World Nomad Games and it is time to get out and get to know the country a little bit. So we're taking a day trip to Karakol (Каракол). We're going to be doing some hiking, visiting waterfalls. Yeah, it is going to be really cool. I mean we've seen quite a bit of the country but we haven't been to that area yet so we're really excited about it. Let's go. Okay, so we have been driving for about two hours and we've almost made it to Karakol (Каракол). Right now we're in the outskirts and we're stopping at the Nikolay Mikhailovich Przhevalsky museum and basically this was a guy who wanted to be a traveler. So I can relate to him. Um, he was from Russia but at the time Russian didn't have the permission to just you know go off and wander around on their own. So this guy decided to join the military and he proposed to be the first person to explore Central Asia and reach Tibet and his proposal was approved so he was funded by Russia and today there is a museum dedicated to his work. After a short visit to the museum, we then continued on our drive towards Karakol (Каракол), where our first stop was the Dungan Mosque. So in order to visit the Mosque you don't just wear a scarf. You need a full cloak. This will be interesting. Alright. Let's put this on. Fancy. It is like velvet. There we go. I'm ready. Wow, cute. The mosque gets its name from the Dungan people who are Muslim, but of Chinese origin. The building is quite unique because you can see the two cultures colliding; it contains elements of a traditional mosque, but at first glance it looks more like a Buddhist temple. So now we're visiting an Orthodox Church and that was really close to the mosque so let's go check it out. Let's go. We then went to the Holy Trinity Cathedral, which is in the centre of Karakol (Каракол). Just remember, girls need to wear a head covering and boys must take off their hats in order to go inside. From there we continued to the Karakol Market in search of food. If there’s one dish the town is known for it’s Ashlyan Fu, a cold noodle soup with spices and jellies. There’s a whole alley in the market that specializes in this dish; so be sure to try it. Alright so we've had a pretty busy morning of sightseeing. Now it is time for food. Yeah, we've worked up a pretty big appetite and the coolest thing is we're going to go eat inside of yurt. A yurt. For lunch we had Dumlyama: a dish with potatoes, cabbage, onions, peppers, and meat. We also had boorsok: which are little pieces of fried dough that go really nice with jam. So we've stopped off at this kind of cool scenic area that is called Jeti-Ögüz and nearby there is apparently some fantastic hiking. Yeah, and the name translates to seven bulls so I don't know do you see any bulls over there? You know I see in the rock formations. I think I see more than seven things. We had really been looking forward to hiking along here, but unfortunately, this is the part of the tour where we ran out of time. This also means we didn’t get to see the waterfalls we had heard about, so if you do decide to visit Karakol (قاراقول), don’t do it as a quick day trip like we did! Alright, so we are back in our hotel and that was a pretty busy day I have to admit. Um, the distances are quite long so we spent a lot of time in the car and we did get to see some cool places but we didn't spend as much time as we would have liked. Yeah, I think it is the kind of place where you want to give it a few days so you can see the surrounding areas and also that town is really known for hiking so if you're in to outdoorsy stuff go there and explore it properly. Yeah, maybe spend like two or three days in Karakol (Каракол) see the surroundings, hike, trek and yeah really explore it. That would be our suggestion. Yep. Tata. Well good morning. It is Saturday here in Bishkek (Бишкéк) and it is our last day in the city so we figured why not get out of the city get close to nature. So we're going to be doing some hiking. Yeah, it is basically a day trip. We're joining like a hiking group. Yeah, the Trekking Union. Yeah, they go every week and we're just going to be doing like I think it is a pretty leisurely hike but it is going to be really scenic. I really hope so. Fingers crossed. So ending off here in Kyrgyzstan (Кыргызстан) on a high note hopefully. Let's go. It is go time. We have arrived at the starting point. Today we're hiking Issyk-Ata Gorge. And now get this. We signed up for what we thought was a thirteen kilometer hike. They've just told us it is twenty five and we're going to be out all day. So I feel like this is a bit extreme. We're not that fit. We're not that prepared so it'll be interesting that is for sure. I hope we have enough water. Status update. Status update. We've been hiking for like twenty minutes and it is getting really steep and we've lost our group because we're too slow apparently. So two funny things. We had to sign a waiver in order to join this trek and there were two particular points that kind of jumped out at us. First, we had to agree that we wouldn't run away during the hike but it is like. You know how much we like to do that so. That was almost a sticking point. Where are we going to run? And number two we had to promise we wouldn't drink alcohol. Haha. But again alcohol on a twenty five kilometer hike. I feel like that is just asking for trouble and we barely have enough water so. In other words we have to dump out the moonshine that is in my backpack, right? Ha. Time for a status update. So we've been hiking for a while and the weather really changed on us quickly. It started raining, the winds started coming and this is a really fast hiking group so we've really had to pick up the pace so we haven't had many updates but we're taking a little break here and the group is way ahead of us but we don't care at this point. So as far as hiking in Kyrgyzstan is concerned it is amazing. It is like world class. You have all of this rugged scenery and there is not a lot of people hiking here so it is an amazing opportunity for anyone who is looking for kind of an off-the-beaten-path type of destination. So we're actually going to start heading back now for two reasons. First of all the weather is changing rapidly and it looks like it is going to start raining. Yeah, and we've also lost our group. Yeah, they disappeared. We were a little bit slow-pokey because we were taking photos and we just got left behind and now it is time for us I think we need to head back so yeah there is a few other straddlers. Like four of us who are slowly making our way back to the van trying to retrace our steps. So I think that is it for today's outing. Overall, a really good day of hiking. Tata. So it is time for another apartment tour. Right now we're in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. We've been traveling around the country for three weeks and we've spent ten of those days here in the capital. Yes, and this happens to be our favorite spot out of the two or three different places we've stayed in the city. So we're going to show you around. Let's go. So getting in here is like going into Fort Knox. So much security but we feel really safe even with all of these keys and special magnets. Hahaha. Let's go. Beep. Beep. Key sounds. But before we give you the apartment tour we need to have breakfast and they make a delicious breakfast over here. Yeah, we've been having basically a feast every morning. Uh-huh. And today they switched it up a little bit which is cool. We've been having omelets previously and kind of rolled up crepes with jam but if you take a look down here you can see we've got fried eggs, it looks like we have some ham, tomatoes, cucumber and then we have a different style of pancake here and it looks like little dollops of jam. We have toast, we have orange juice. Juice. And coffee. Is it coffee or tea? It is coffee. Oh, it is coffee. Again they switched it up. Oooh. But yeah that is a lot of food for two people. Look at the table. And the cool thing about this type of place is that you kind of you get comforts of an apartment but we're getting a little bit of the service of a hotel. Like having breakfast prepared for us in the morning. The best of both worlds. It really is. It really is. Alright, let's dig in. Okay, grabbing some egg and a bit of ham. It is tasty. So now that we've had our breakfast it is time for the grand tour so we're going to show you around our one bedroom apartment. So come in. This is like I guess our little lobby area. Do you have a lobby area in an apartment. It is probably called something else. Hahaha. The cloakroom area. So this is where the shoes are kept. Shoes, umbrellas and you can hang up your coats over here. And then it kind of goes straight into the kitchen and we actually have a pretty nice modern kitchen. I really like it. Yeah. And we've got a washing machine. We do. That is like. When we decide to rent an apartments as opposed to staying in a hotel that is like the number one feature. It is one of the best things aside from having our own fridge of course too. So we have an electric range so we can cook. We have a kettle, no microwave but we haven't really needed that. We've mostly been eating out. Oh, guess what? We do have one. Hahaha. We haven't needed it though in all fairness because we have been eating out a lot and we've been having our breakfast served to us as well. So yeah, this is our little breakfast nook. This is where we have breakfast every morning. Yeah, as you can see the dirty dishes. Okay, next we'll show you the bathroom since it is right across from the kitchen. So here we go. Tada. So we kind of have like this walk in shower. This shower, I have to say is like. Open it up for us. It is almost like a 5 star shower. Like the quality is incredible. The water pressure. Like check out that thing. It is huge. So yeah, that is our bathroom and then I'll take you into the bedroom. This is just a one bedroom apartment so it is pretty small. Come in. So yeah, I guess you could call this like the bedroom slash living area. So we have a double bed but we also have some couches over here where we can work do our thing on the computer. Um, so yeah I mean it is enough space for two people. It is really all you need and we have a bit of storage as well. We haven't really unpacked our stuff since it is a short stay. Yeah. And the weather has been really nice so we haven't had to unpack much of our cold weather gear. We've got storage, a TV and we have a little balcony. I'll show you that. So I'll just move these away. This is actually where I put the laundry out to dry because it is pretty hot out there. And I'll show you the view. You basically look out over the courtyard which is cool. Yeah, there is like a little playground for kids and then way off in the distance here. The zoom will take a little while you can see it is kind of either an unfinished or an abandoned building. And that is kind of a major landmark because we stayed two blocks from there at a hotel before. So totally recognize that building. So that is a wrap for our little Bishkek apartment tour. Yeah, so basically it was really cool staying here because I felt like we got to a little bit of window into the culture. The Soviet Era complex apartment buildings. Like these massive buildings. We're getting to stay in here and even though we're like on the first or second level. First level. We're not near the top it is still really cool and it is just like whenever you can stay in apartments as opposed to a hotel it is always like so much better because you feel a little bit like you're at home, you have more space you have more amenities, you have kitchen where you can wash your clothes. So whenever we have that opportunity we tend to take it. Yes, oh and another important thing it is cheaper than the hotel too. So now if you're thinking of traveling to Bishkek (Бишкек) or perhaps moving here now you have a better idea of what the apartments look like. Yeah, exactly. So I hope you enjoyed this tour and if you've been to Bishkek (Бишкек) before let us know what your apartment experience or hotel experience was like.

We are here in Italy. It is our first day, so we have gone in search of the Italian breakfast. Now we weren't entirely sure what an Italian breakfast looks like so we did a bit of research and asked around and apparently it is just a coffee and anything sweet. So that could be pastries, bread with jam, cake or cookies. So we've sat down at a little cafe and we're going to have our first Italian breakfast. So my beverage of choice today is the cappuccino because it is a very cold day. And why not have some frothy coffee. It's a cold day. When is fifteen degrees considered cold? Look at the way I'm dressed. I'm cold okay? Ooh, that is nice. Excellent cappuccino. Nice and rich and frothy? Mmmm. Indeed. Wanna try some? So this breakfast reminds me a bit of breakfast in France and also in Argentina. A sweet way to start the day and I have to say it is a quite a huge contrast and change from what we were used to in England and Ireland where we were having full savory breakfasts. With eggs and sausages and mushrooms. Lower calories and a lot sweeter. And this pastry here I've selected, I honestly don't really know what it is. What made me select it was that I saw walnut bits. And hey, I'm a huge fan of walnuts so I don't know what is inside. It looks like it might be apple. Let's find out. I thought it was going to be prunes. Mmmm. No, no no. That is like pecan pie. That's pecan filling inside. Let's see the inside. Oh wow! That is so delicious. Oh, it's like having pecan pie. Pie for breakfast. He's a happy boy. And what do you have over there? Well, this is the pastry I chose. It is a little twisty one with chocolate chips. That is really good. It is very buttery and flaky. And you just can't go wrong with chocolate chips this early in the morning. I'm a fan. So we're going to be here for a week in the Lombardy region and I can't wait to try as much Italian food as possible. It's one of my favorite cuisines. And last but not least, price point? Well, this delicious breakfast for two came to five Euros and that included two cappuccinos and two pastries. So not an expensive way to start the day. Yeah, talk about value. Mmmmhhmmm. Okay guys, so I'm pretty excited about today. We have left Bergamo behind and we're visiting a castle outside in the countryside. It's called Castello di Malpaga and we are going to be taking a cooking class inside a castle. So I'm going to get ready to start cooking and Sam is going to give you a tour of the castle so you can see what it looks like. So this is a family owned castle. It dates back to the 13th Century. Let me give you a tour. The first lesson of the day was to focus on dishes that take the longest to prepare, so we got started with dessert- a delicious tiramisu with a modern twist! Like that? More aggressively. Like that. So I'm taking a quick break from the kitchen to tell you today's menu. We are going to be preparing beef tartare as an entree, ravioli for the main course and then tiramisu for dessert. So it should be very tasty. Let's get back to the kitchen and let's keep cooking. For our main dish we prepared ravioli, and because this is Italy the dough had to be made from scratch. There were no shortcuts here and everyone was put to work kneading and then rolling out the dough into thin layers. What are we doing over here? Rolling some pasta. It requires a lot of muscle work. More muscle than I have. Preparing the stuffing was next. We went with a vegetarian option, which was pumpkin. Smashing pumpkins. Like the bad. Hahahaha. So clever. Once again, we took no shortcuts here. Pumpkins were chopped, peeled, and then boiled, before being pressed into a paste that we used as our filling. The last dish of the day was beef tartare. I skipped out since it's not to my taste, but I was told it was very tasty. So we have now finished preparing our three course meal and we're going to go have lunch inside the feast hall which has painted frescoes that are just beautiful. So let's go in. Buon appetito! How is the food so far? It is delicious because I prepared it myself. I hardly did any work actually. The truth comes out. And now that lunch is over we get to play dress-up. Let me lead you around my castle. I am Queen of this kingdom. Once we had eaten lunch, it was finally time to tour the castle - a very exciting prospect, especially when you're dressed in Renaissance costumes. We paraded around like kings and queens, and then explored the former home of Bartolomeo Colleoni, who was captain-general of the Republic of Venice and earned quite the reputation battling neighbouring city-states. We're Kings and Queens from around the world. And winter is coming. Winter is coming. So I had a lot of fun cooking, eating and playing king for a day in a castle but unfortunately all good things come to an end and it is time for us to go back to Milan. Well good evening from Milan. It is our first full day here and it is now dinner time. So we just found a local little restaurant and we're going to be trying a traditional dish that is very popular in this city and in the Lombardy region. We are going to have Risotto alla Milanese. First impressions from Milan so far? Ah, it's been great. Especially the food. And every time you go to a restaurant I'm looking at the menu and I'm like I want this, I want this, I want this, I want this. So I have a hard time deciding and I'm not even sure if we're going to get to cover everything before we leave. Well, tonight it is risotto. First impressions of Italian food here in Milan? It's been really good. This bread I'm having right now is really good actually. I'm already on my forth slice. I'm a little worried because I may start to get full before the risotto actually arrives. My Risotto alla Milanese has arrived. And in case you're not too familiar with risotto it is basically a type of rice that is very thick, very starchy and it absorbs a lot of liquids. So this should be good. It almost looks a little soupy and creamy. And also my Risotto alla Milanese gets its color from saffron. So saffron is a bit of a reddish orange color when it is dry but when you stick it and mix it with the rice it turns it yellow. So enough about that let's try it. Surprise! Mmmmm. Do you like that? Oh, wow! That is so good. And it is already cheesy. I mean I know I added a lot of cheese but I think they had already melted some cheese and mixed it in. So yeah, very cheesy and very buttery. You can never get too much cheese. That is so good. You're going to like this. Wow. Is it heaven? Seriously that is amazing. Like risotto might be my new favorite Italian food. It's that good. It's so good. It is that good. And the thing I like about this one is that it is really plain. Like I've had other types of risotto and there is a lot of things going on. There is a lot of different ingredients but this is just really simple. You've got your cheese, you've got your saffron. Yum. Right now it is six twenty in the evening and we've basically got the restaurant to ourselves and that is because locals would never go out to eat this early. This is not even close to dinnertime. I'm thinking more like eight, nine, ten maybe even eleven. That is what time dinner is. And we can see all of the empty chairs right behind you. Judging by your plate I'm assuming you enjoyed it? That is an empty plate and a happy boy. And the price was also very reasonable coming in at seven Euros. Great value, excellent meal. So we've gone out for our first Italian Aperitivo. Which is kind of like a pre-dinner drinking tradition. Basically, you get yourself a cocktail for about 10 Euros and that gives you access to this massive buffet of like pizzas, pastas, olives. Anything you could possibly imagine. And this is what comes before dinner. So I have to admit I was expecting very simple food for the Aperitivo. I thought maybe they would just give us some prosciutto cheese and olives. You know, pretty cheap simple food. But instead what we've found was this. So I've got lasagna, I've got ravioli. I have have stir-fried veggies. And even french fries which are not Italian but I had to grab a few anyways since they were available. So how about you? What did you get for the Aperitivo? Give us a tour. Well, basically I almost exactly the same as you. The main difference being I got a huge slice of pizza and I think I got some more cold cuts and cheese. You know what? All the pizza was gone when I went up there. I think you took the last slice. What can I say. Alright, so I'm having a Bellini which is made with peach juice and something else. But I can't tell you what that something else is because I just don't know my cocktails very well. It's good stuff right there. Sweet? Mmmmm. Ah! And it appears you've gone for something a bit more tropical. Yeah, how can you go wrong with a classic Piña colada. Now this looks really thick. I'm hoping that they put a lot of coconut and not too much pineapple juice. That's a pretty decent blend. Yeah. Yeah, I really taste the coconut. I like it. So the savory part is over. What have we got now? Well, it was time for dessert so I went back for seconds and they had lots of different cakes. And then this is really good. I'm not entirely sure what it is but it tastes a bit like a vanilla pudding crossed with custard. I don't know my Italian desserts but I can tell you it is really good. So I'm not going to share. Okay, so final thoughts on your first Aperitivo experience. How was it? Well, considering we spent several nights in Milan I can't believe it took us to our final night to actually go and try it. We should have been doing this every night. It's fantastic. You get a really nice cocktail. You get a nice spread of food and dessert too for 10 Euros. It's fantastic value. And what did you think of it? Honestly, for me that was enough for dinner. It was a lot of food. I mean it is an open buffet so technically you can go up as many times as you want but you don't want to be overdoing it. Kind of like Vegas buffet style where you're just slapping the food on your plate until you've got a big mountain. That's not how it works over here. But it was really good, really tasty food. I would also recommend coming early. Aperitivo is usually between six and ten PM. We showed up at like six thirty and it was already quite packed so come early, get a table and there will be more food options as well. Good morning from Chiavenna. It is a bit of a rainy morning but we are still very excited to be here and out exploring because there is a festival taking place here. Today is the day of the Bresaola and that means that we are celebrating a deli meat. And there is lots of different stands that have been setup across the town. So you can just wander around and sample some deli meats. So we're going to be trying lots of food today. It's very exciting. And just to give you a bit of background information, Bresaola is kind of similar to prosciutto but it is made from beef and it has very little fat. So that is coming up in this video. So this is a look at the map of Chiavenna and it shows where are the Bresaola tastings are going to be taking place. And there is fourteen different spots across the town, so I think we're going to be eating quite a bit. Want to try some? Later. Mmmm. That's really good. Really tasty. We are looking for more meat. Carnivores today! There is only bread available right now so everyone is waiting patiently while they slice more Bresaola. I've got some more Bresaola. I think by the end of the day we're going to be suffering from meat sweats. It's so good. It's so good, I wish I knew how to describe this properly but it is just good. You need to come to Italy and try it. What else can I say. This one here appears to be a bit of a darker meat than we've tried before. And I'm pairing it with some bread. One big bite. Yeah, that's awesome. More bresaola guys. You know lunchtime is about an hour away and I feel like I'm just walking around town eating my appetizer. It's pretty nice. First impressions so far? So what I've been noticing as we've been wandering around is that there is a lot of different stands open selling all kinds of different things. As you can see behind me there is rugs being sold. Oh, so it is not just about the food. Nope. So the mood here is very happy, very jovial. There are lots of different bands playing at every square around town. I just feel bad for the puppies. Some people are walking around with their dogs and they just look a little frightened and startled. Okay, and this meat appears to be a bit lighter than the last one I tried. Again, I have the same dark bread. It is so good I can see why they have a whole festival just based on meat. So that is a wrap for us from the festival. I don't think either of us has ever been to a festival that is centered around just one particular food item. But it was really cool, a little bit quirky and definitely one of the more interesting things we did while in Italy. But not for vegetarians. Definitely not. One of the pleasures of coming to Italy is indulging in the local ice cream known as gelato. Here we've each got two cones. I've got the waffle cone over here and Audrey's going to be trying the regular cone. We've got different flavors and we can't wait to try a taste test now. Okay, so I went for a medium sized cone with two scoops. The first flavor is wild berries and the second one on top is a bit unusual. It is pear and cheese. I've never had cheese flavored ice cream before unless it was cheesecake. So it should be interesting. Mmmmm. Okay, wild berries are really good. One more lick. Mmmm. Okay. So that is the pear and cheese. It has real chunks of pear so it is very fruity. It has a nice strong flavor. And you also taste a hint of cheese. I couldn't tell you what kind of cheese it is but it is coming through. I'm very happy with the selection. Now tell us about the flavors in your giant waffle cone. Yeah, so I picked two as well. This one over here is black cherry. Hahaha. Is that good? A bit of brain freeze. I took too big of a bite. Yeah, you can really taste the cherry. It is very strong and over here is pistachio. And pistachio is awesome. It is one of my favorite ice cream flavors. I think the only one I particularly like more is rum and raisin but they didn't have that. So what would be the difference between gelato and regular ice cream that we're used to in North America? Okay, so there are a few key differences. First up, gelato is churned at a slower rate so that means it gets less air and then it has a thicker, denser quality. And the second key difference is that gelato has a lower fat content which means the flavors of the ice cream really come through. So that is why I like gelato a lot better than ice cream. So gelato is also served at a slightly higher temperature than ice cream meaning it melts fast and that is why we're gobbling it down really quickly right now. Mmmhhhmm. Yours is already melting. It sure is. And how about that price point for that delicious little treat we enjoyed? Okay, so my medium sized cone was two fifty and Sam's was three fifty. And those prices are in Euros. And also a gelato is really easy to find in just about any city. Just as we were walking down the street we came across maybe like four or five different shops, so try it out the next time you're in Italy. So it is lunchtime here in Milan and we figured why not have pizza when in Italy. I've only had pizza once the whole time I've been here and it was time to try a few others. So we've been walking around the city and we walked by this one shop and we saw they had like these extra thick slices of pizza. It almost looked like a focaccia bread with toppings. So we went in there and grabbed two slices. Tell us what did you get for yourself? So I got the one that had salami and mozzarella. And this reminds me a lot of the pizza I had in Buenos Aires in Argentina. These massive thick slices that you would just go into a shop and order. And I think this is going to be delicious. Ooh, time for the first bite. And I like that has already been pre-sliced into small little pieces for us. Perfect for lunch at the park. That's really good. Tasty? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Gooey cheese? Oh, yeah. I don't even have anything to say. Hahaha. What did you get on yours? Okay, so mine has what I believe in mozzarella and some small tomatoes and basil leaves. So it looks really good. And I was asking the guy who served our pizza, you know, what kind of pizza is it? What style is it? And he called it pizza al trancio. And I looked that up and it basically means pizza by the piece or pizza by the slice. And as you can see it has already been pre-sliced into little portions, so it is perfect for you know just getting it to go, having lunch at a park or eating it outdoors. Yeah, we're having it in a park now as it just starts to rain. So time to try this. It looks wonderful. Oh my goodness. Wow! Is that good? Oh, yeah. So the dough, I mean it is really thick but it also has a bit of a fluffy quality to it and that is like a thick layer of cheese as well. Like that is a generous amount of cheese. Check this out? Look at all that cheese. It kind of reminds me of Chicago Deep Dish style as well. So the only other slice of pizza we've had in Milan so far was the super super thin slice of pizza. How does this over here compare? Well, you can never go wrong with pizza as far as I'm concerned. But if I had to choose, one of the two, I would go with the thicker pizza. I just love the thick dough and the generous amount of cheese. That is just unbelievable. And you're getting more bang for your buck so it is more food technically. Yeah, that is true. And how much did those two slices of pizza cost? Okay, so that was seven Euros total for the two slices. So about three fifty each. Not bad for such a giant slice of pizza, I'd say. Good afternoon from the city of Bergamo. Today we took a day trip from Milan, we rode the train for less than an hour and we arrived at a completely new destination. So we've been exploring the town of Bergamo and we also learned that there is a dessert that is very popular in this city. And that is what I have right here. This right here is called Polenta e osei. And Polenta is made from corn. It is kind of like a finely ground corn or maze. And it is usually served in savory dishes with like a tomato sauce or some type of other sauce. Um, but it has been turned into a dessert here. So we're having sweet Polenta. And apparently the name means 'a bird' osei is meant to be bird in the local dialect. So yeah, bird polenta. That is what we're having today. Time to take a bite. Mmmm. Bird polenta. Mmmm. It's supposed to be really sweet. Is it? I wonder if it is just polenta on the exterior because look at the inside. It almost looks a little bit like cake. So I wonder if it is just the yellow coating that is the polenta. I'm not entirely sure. And is it sweet? Oh, very sweet. Very sugary. I mean you can see the granulated sugar on the outside. Super sweet. But yeah, it is a completely new dessert for me. Want to give it a try? And it is unique to here. We later discovered that the reason it tasted so sweet is because we had a lost in translation moment with our guide. The dessert we tried bares the exact same name as a savory polenta dish with a bird cooked inside. The dessert was given this name because from the exterior it looks just like polenta but when you bite in it is cake. A little confusing but nevertheless tasty. Your turn to give it a try. Oh, he's making out with it. Wow! That is some kind of sweet. What do you think? Some kind of sweet? It is definitely tasty. Yeah. That is the kind of thing that I don't think I could eat this whole thing. It is too sweet. It is a little overpowering isn't it? It is. You know, I feel quite lucky to have had the opportunity to try this today because we got a recommendation from a local upon arriving. And we had no idea that this even existed. Polenta as a dessert? Hmmmm. Who knew? And now I think you should try whatever is on top there. Do you think that is marzipan? It's a kind of chocolate. I don't know. What is he doing? Yeah, I think it is. Yeah? It's also really sweet. Wow. I'm getting a bit of a sugar high right now. Do you think you can finish all of that? Is that like a challenge? Oh. Does that mean challenge accepted? Okay, try and describe this dessert for someone who has never had it before? Yeah, it is quite unique. So the outer layer here, you can see it is mostly granulated sugar and polenta. That is probably the sweetest parts. And inside it is kind of like a sponge cake with an icing filling. And upon further research it looks like we've found a secret chocolate layer in the middle. Okay, so this is the dessert that keeps on giving basically. Yeah, basically. So in terms of price point you can pick up this dessert at almost any pastry shop inside the old town. It costs three Euros and I found it so sweet that you can probably split it and share it with two people.",False,"20161231 - Ultimate Lombardy Food Tour ≡ƒç«≡ƒç╣ΓÇ» ∩╜£ Milan Breakfast, Risotto allaΓÇ»Milanese, Aperitivo, Bresaola.en.srt"

It's definitely been a highlight of our trip. We've absolutely loved eating Romanian food, so we can't wait to show you a few new things. So I'm very excited because our food has finally arrived and first up I'm going to show you this Moldavian pancake. So it is basically a dough pancake and it is filled with sheep's cheese and cow's cheese but our server also asked if we wanted bacon inside, so we said 'yes, of course.' So let's dig in. I'm going to cut it up and show you what it looks like. On this inside. Oh, yeah. You can see all of the cheese seeping out. Mmmm. Yeah, we've had this a few times and they're really generous with the cheese. Oh yeah. And you can order all different kinds of cheese. They have cottage cheese, you can get mozzarella cheese, whatever you like. Oh, so check it out from this angle. Can you see the bacon in there? Oh, yeah. Oh yeah, baby. Oh, yeah. Let's try it. I'm just eating it like a pizza. I don't know if is right. Oh, that's still hot. Mmmm. That's really good guys. Really good. A little greasy. My fingers are looking oily. But those flavors, the salty cheese and then you've got the bacon. It's real good. It's a nice little appetizer here. I like that you can have it as an appetizer or you could also have it as a main. Like if you were to eat that whole thing it's filling. Alright, time for myself to cut a slice. Oh la lah. It is hot. Mmmm. That is just so amazing. Like, I think this might be my favorite Romanian food. This is just so good. These cheese is so salty and I just love anything that kind of resembles a pizza. And we forgot to mention this can also be served as a dessert. That's right. You can get sweet ones as well. Yeah, sweet cheese and raisins and cranberries. We haven't tried one of those yet but. Maybe we should. Hahaha. Okay, look over here because this is a pretty cool dish. Polenta balls. And I find it really interesting because I've had polenta before in places like Argentina and Italy but I've never seen the polenta rolled out into a little ball like they do here in Romania. And if I cut it in half you can see that it is stuffed with cheese. Oh, yeah. Just look at that. Oh, yeah. And here it comes with a garlic sauce with dill and also sour cream. So let's add a bit of sour cream. Dunk that in the garlic. Look at that. Oh, wow. Mmmm. That's real good. That is so garlic-y. I'm going to have really bad breath after this but it is so good. It is worth it. We're going to need to buy some breath mints and maybe some gum. Alright, so I think I've said this before but I'm going to say it one more time. The first time for me to try polenta I really was not a fan. I thought gosh this is so bland but when I started having it with cheese and eating it more regularly while here in Romania I've really come to enjoy it, so this is a dish that whenever we get Romanian food we always have to find some way to include polenta now. Yes, we do. Hahaha. Big fans of polenta over here. This is my first time trying the balls and they're really good. I like the cheese inside. Mmm. What do you have over here. Can you tell us about this? Yeah, so over here I have basically, if you look down again, so we can see. We have basically a pork cheese bake. So you can see that the cheese is melted on top. You have pork right here. And if you look, if I kind of move this around you can see that there is a really nice cream sauce and there is a lot of potatoes, different vegetables. Oh, and mushrooms. And then you have tomatoes all around the outside. So it is really tasty. You get a lot of different ingredients happening. Try some of that. This is really good. This sort of reminds me a little bit of a lasagna. Mmmmm. And of course we could not resist getting some dessert. So we are having something called Tort a Lunel. And I'm probably butchering the name but that is how I think it is pronounced. And it is basically a dense chocolate cake with Halva, walnuts and peanuts. Oh, my! And it is quite hard to cut through but that is just because there is so much chocolate in there. It's a very dense cake. Yeah, and look at that caramel. Look at that. Amazing. Big spoonful of chocolate cake right there. Oh yeah. I think it has caramel too. It is quite sticky and gooey. Great for chocolate lovers. Alright, time for me to try this. Wow! That is some kind of decadent. I don't even know how we're going to finish this. The two of us with one piece of cake. I find when I'm having Romanian food I am so stuffed by the end of the meal. Siesta time after this for sure. Don't worry, I can take care of this on my own if you leave it up to me. Well, well. I'm guessing you enjoyed that? You better believe it. That was one heck of a big meal. I'm just basically in Siesta mode already. Sipping on my coffee. Not moving at all. Time for price point. It was 95 Lei which if we do the conversion according to Sam is very cheap. Right, Sam? Yeah, it is just over 20 US dollars and we ended up getting 3 drinks, 3 mains and a dessert. Not bad. It is dinnertime and we are at restaurant Transilvania. In Brasov and we are trying traditional Romanian cuisine. Let's go in and order some food. Yum! So you've got yourself a fancy drink? Yeah, I'm just diving right in and trying things I've never had before. This is called afinata and it is a bilberry brandy. And, woah, it smells strong, so let's try a sip of that. Good stuff? Oh, yeah it is so sweet but yet it has like really high alcohol content. Is it like a syrup? Yeah, it tastes very syrup-y. That's a good way of describing it. Well, very exciting times. My food has finally arrived. If you have a look down here I'm having polenta with cottage cheese and sour cream. And I also got some goulash on the side which I know is Hungarian but it was on the menu so 'hey' I got it anyway. So let's start with the polenta because that is very Romanian. Look at that. Look at the cheese. Look at the sour cream. Mmmm. Oh, wow. Is that good stuff? That's good. That's real good. Okay, so tell us about your plate? Now on the menu I saw something I could not resist ordering. It was called Dracula pork. And if something is good enough for Dracula. It's good enough for me. So let's take a look at this. It appears to be pork with some kind of sauce and like a copious amount of cheese. So it's like a melted cheese and maybe ketchup. Maybe it is Dracula's blood on your little pork medallion. Could be. Dracula's blood! Would Dracula approve? I think he would. Yeah. That's really tasty. And I ordered a side of polenta to go with my steak as well. So I'm going to try a bite. That's surprisingly tasty. I have to admit the first time I tried polenta, which was not that long ago, I didn't really like it. I thought gosh that is kind of bland. But it is really growing on me and if you haven't tried it before it's made out of cornmeal. And it has a yeah a kind of starchy kind of taste. You just need a good sauce on the polenta for it to taste good I think. Yeah, I agree. And we ate all of this. How are you feeling? Bulging belly time. You've tried quite a bit of Romanian food so far. What are your impressions? My impressions are that it is quite tasty. It's typical of other Eastern European cuisines in the sense that it is very hearty. There is a lot of meat, there is a lot of starchy foods like polenta and potatoes and there is something else that is really cool is that there is really good wine here. Wine here is fantastic. What's your take on Romanian food? Well, I am stuffed beyond belief so I have to agree. Very hearty. Very filling. Um, I also think this is not a country for vegetarians. You see meat during every meal. During lunch and dinner. Especially pork. So, keep that in mind. So even though we're quite full we couldn't resist ordering a Romanian dessert. So right here we've got sponge cake with chocolate pudding, chocolate sauce. I think it has orange cognac and whipped cream. And who knows what else. So let's just dig in. That's a huge portion. We're sharing this. Mmmm. Wow. I wish they had given. Try that again. I inhaled it. We're keeping this. We're keeping this. I'm choking on dessert for eating too fast. So is it like again? I was going to say. I wish they had given me a bigger spoon because it is so good. I want bigger bites. Bigger mouthfuls. But maybe that is not a good thing because I'm choking. How much did that come to? That came to seventy three Lei. And when you convert that into US dollars it was only eighteen dollars.

We are here in Dublin and it is lunchtime so we've tracked down the oldest pub in the whole country. We are here at the Brazen Head which apparently dates back to 1198. That's like what 900 hundred years or so that this place has been around. But I mean obviously not the whole structure is authentic. It is probably just a few bricks and stones. But anyways it is the oldest in the country and we're here for lunch. So Sam is having his Guinness and I'm going for a nice pot of tea. Got to stay warm in the city. teetotaller. Owe that burns. Oh my gosh. Hahaha. Wow. That is hot. Careful over there. Be careful. I've seriously been waiting for this for a long time. Of course I've tried Guinness before but this is my first pint of Guinness in Ireland and I'm ecstatic because it is basically my favorite beer in the whole world. Ooh. An extra special beer today. Oh, so fresh. So tasty. You know what, I could drink this literally as a meal. It's that good. So it is a cold day here in Dublin so I've gone for a cream of vegetable which isn't a very typical Irish dish but I think it is going to keep me warm. Mmmmm. Tasty? Very. So you've gone for something a little bit more hearty. Yeah, like this burger is enormous. It's one of the biggest looking burgers I've had in a while. Oh la lah. And these fries. These are the thickest cut of fries. Look they're thicker than my finger. I hope you're planning to share. Hahahaha. I don't know about that. Time to try one of these bad boys. It's hot. Yeah, they're done really nicely. Really crispy on the inside and mushy in the middle. Like that. Ready to devour that monster burger of yours? Alright, this thing is so massive I'm barely able to hold it here. Wow. Can you chew and describe it at the same time? That was such a big bite. So I got a bit of everything in that bite. Bacon, the meat, the vegetables and the lettuce and the patty. That's a really good burger. It's thick, the meat is juicy and the cheese is fresh and delicious. Let's have a little bit of a travel update. What are we going to be doing over the next few weeks? So, over the next two weeks first we're going to be spending one week in Dublin just checking out the city, visiting some of the main attractions, eating lots of Irish food and seeing what that is all about. And then our second week in Ireland we're actually parting ways. Sam and I will be doing our own thing. I'm doing a girls road trip with my two sisters. You sound really happy about that. Yes! But yeah, I'm doing a girls road trip for a whole week and my sisters and two of my friends are flying over from Canada. So this is just going to be the five of us. That will be lots of fun and no boys allowed. And I guess Sam, you're going to be hanging out here watching football. All by my lonesome huh? Mmm hmmmm. That's the plan. So it is not all doom and gloom over here. Even though I'm by myself I'm planning a trip up to Kerry and I'm going to be coming back to Dublin and I'm going to watch some Gaelic football. I don't know a lot about the sport but they're having a really huge event happening and I want to take it in. Well that was a really neat bar. What kind of makes it unique, aside from it being the oldest pub in all of Ireland of course, is that there is all of these different kinds of rooms. You can eat outside, you can eat inside a bar and there is a second level up top. And so we checked out most of it. I'm really excited about lunch today. I'm trying something for the first time called Irish Stew. And that consists of mutton, potatoes and onions. And it is considered to be sort of a peasant type of meal. But considering how cold it is outside. It has been hovering around the 15 degree mark and it has been raining a lot. This is the perfect kind of food to help warm us up. So like Sam was saying the main ingredients in an Irish Stew are usually mutton, potatoes and onions but you can get a little bit fancy with the recipe and start adding different vegetables. So what I have here actually has carrots, celery and a few different herbs and spices. So I can't wait to try that. I'm really hungry. Mmmm. Oh my gosh. That is really nice. Like it is actually really cold outside. It's been raining all day so it is really nice to be inside, sitting in a pub and enjoying my stew. Wearing your new sweater. Grab some meat over there. Yeah, this is just the kind of meal I'm craving on this type of day. So we've already talked a bit about the ingredients that you'll find in an Irish Stew. And something that is really cool is that sometimes they add Guinness to it. So what else can you tell us about stew? Well, I've actually almost finished my plate so it is delicious. Also the meat was very soft and tender so I imagine it has been boiled and simmered for a couple of hours. And yeah, it is just a really great dish if you find yourself in Ireland try it out. So give us a price point for Irish Stew. So at the place we're eating here we picked it up for 9 Euro at a lunch special. But keep in mind this is the city centre of Dublin and I'm guessing in the countryside it is considerably cheaper. So this afternoon we're doing a battle of the drinks. We are ordering two different spiked coffees. Sam is getting the Irish Coffee and I'm getting the Baileys Coffee. And we're going to see which one is the tastiest. So I've known for a while I've wanted to do an Irish Coffee taste test video but of course I didn't know where to go. While walking around the streets of Dublin we found a place that said: ""This has got the best Irish Coffee in the city."" So we're looking forward to trying it and seeing if it is the best. What is in your Irish Whiskey? Tell us. Alright, so if you take a look over here you'll notice that there is cream on the top. And then this is normal coffee which has been enhanced with sugar. And the secret ingredient here is Jameson Whiskey. Oh, yeah! Time to take a sip. That must be good because you're chugging it. That is so good. I mean I got a big gulp of cream because it is the first sip but I also really tasted a lot of the whiskey and of course there is a really strong coffee flavor. And the sugar. It is like basically having a dessert. So I got a bit more of a feminine drink instead of whisky. This one has Baileys cream liqueur. So let's try it. Ooh, you can definitely still taste the alcohol in that. Mmmmm. Yeah, this is nice. And it is really sweet. Like Sam said about his it is almost like a dessert in a cup. And it is really nice on a cold day. So I'm just going to keep sipping. So basically it is the same as an Irish Coffee the only difference being that there is Baileys instead of the Jameson Whiskey. Yeah. We're switching drinks here for a second. The girly drink. The Baileys. That's really good. I actually prefer Baileys to Whiskey so I'm going to say the Baileys wins out on the Irish Coffee. So I guess it is time for me to try yours. I have a feeling I'm not going to like it as much because I'm not a big whiskey fan. But here we go. You have cream on your lips. I like mine better for sure. Mine is sweeter. This one is a lot stronger. It's got a kick to it. And I feel like if I drank this whole thing I would tumbling by the time I walked out. So Baileys for the win? Baileys for the win. So you enjoyed those? Yeah, I think we're all done here. So in terms of price point you're looking at about 4.95 Euro per drink. That's how much we paid over here. And I think what really makes an Irish Coffee taste good is there is two main components. The first is that they don't skimp out on the Whiskey or Baileys. That they put in you know a generous amount of that. And the other thing has to do with the quality of the coffee. And both were excellent here. So I can give this place a really good score. Breakfast time in Belfast! So since we've been in Ireland my favorite meal has been breakfast. And it's been a full Irish breakfast. We're now in Belfast and over here it is called an Ulster Fry. It's slightly different from an Irish breakfast which we'll explain later. But it is a very complete breakfast, it has a lot of different things including bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, tomatoes and a whole bunch of other stuff which we'll show you in a bit. It is time for a grand tour of the meal. Breakfast has arrived. So we've got soda and potato bread over here. We've got our fried egg. We've got something that resembles a hash-brown. We've got our sausage, our bacon and of course our beans. So that is a very complete meal. Yeah. I hope you're hungry. Yeah, we sure are. So what I find really unique about the Ulster Fry is that you get potato bread and soda bread which are breads that I've never really tried before. But they are quite nice and compact. Very heavy. You know, you're getting your carbs in early in the morning. It looks quite thin but it is really heavy. Starchy. And then this is the soda bread. I'm not really sure if you're supposed to put butter and jam on it since it is more of a savory bread but it is really good on its own. So my favorite part is the sausage. And what I like to do is dip it in with the beans. And I think they call them rashers here. Yeah, they are called rashers. Sam eating rashers. Mmmm. How are they? That's awesome. Mmmmmm. Something that I love about the Ulster Fry and Irish Breakfast is that you can pick it up almost any time of day. We typically have it for breakfast but if you get a craving for it at night you can pop into a restaurant that specializes in the dish and you can have yourself some. And to wrap things up how about the price point? Okay, so we got this breakfast in downtown Belfast and paid 4 Pounds and 50 Pence which I think is pretty decent. And I imagine if you get it out in the suburbs it might be a little bit cheaper because this does look like a really popular place. So today we're up in Belfast and we're trying a traditional Irish and Northern Irish dish. This is called Boxty. And it is basically made with grated potato that is mixed with mashed potatoes and fried in a pan. So Sam and I have ordered to different varieties and we're going to be digging into those because they just arrived and we're so hungry. So I got boxty with ham, cheese and an egg. A fried egg on top. So let's have a taste of this. It's still steaming. Mmmm. Oh! Hahaha. You silly goose. It tastes like fried mashed potatoes. So if I had to compare this dish to anything from back home in North America I would say it is kind of similar to a hash brown except it is a lot thicker and potato is a bit softer. But I mean it is still fried, mashed and grated potatoes. So it's good. Heavy on the carbs, pretty tasty. I like that is comes with different toppings and I could honestly eat this for breakfast, lunch or dinner. So it works anytime of day. Alright, and what do you have over here? So mine is the pulled pork with an apple sauce. Apple chutney. What do you think? It's so good. I love that. I love any kind of potato dish that is fried and then you add some pulled pork to that. Yum! Magic! So there is a little rhyme that goes along with Boxty and it goes a little something like this. Boxty on the griddle, boxty on the pan. If you can't make boxty you can't get a man. I don't know how to make boxty but I somehow landed Sam. So. I must have low standards huh? Uh! So if you take a look at my pint over here you might be thinking I'm having Guinness. It does look a lot like Guinness but in fact it is Belfast Black. And I have to say it tastes just as good if not better. What do we have for dessert? Well, well we couldn't resist getting a Baileys coffee. I think they it the creme cafe. Mmmm. I think I got mostly cream in that sip. You've got a whipped cream mustache over there. That's hot. I keep burning myself today. One more sip. You're taking all of the cream. You're a cream thief. Cream thief! Your turn. I'll share. So what is your dessert? And what we've got down here is an Irish Whiskey chocolate truffle. Oh la lah. The question is does it taste like Whiskey? A bit. Oh my gosh that is so decadent. That's as thick of a piece of pie you're ever going to have. It does look decadent. One more shot because it is just so beautiful. Look at that. Look at that cake. Alright guys, sticky toffee pudding with ice cream. Ice cream. Because we're epic pigs. No? Mmmm. That is nice. Could you get used to that? So it's a nice fluffy warm cake and I think it is fresh right out of the oven. To wrap things up we ate a lot of food but we're just going to focus on the price of the Boxty which was six pounds each. Pretty decent value unless you convert it into Canadian dollars. But other than that it was a really good pub meal. When you're in Ireland or in Northern Ireland try your boxty.",False,20161219 - Irish Cuisine∩╝Ü An introduction to Irish food in Ireland and Northern Ireland.en.srt

However, en route to our destination we made a surprise stop at Vimy Ridge. The Battle of Vimy Ridge was fought during the First World War, where Canadian troops played an important role in capturing German-held ground. Today there's a memorial with a statue of Mother Canada weeping over the lost soldiers. Well, Hello and welcome to Brugge! We are excited to explore the city. We just got here in the afternoon. The light is perfect, the day is beautiful and we're going to go explore and see what the city is all about. Once in Bruges we set off to see the Old Town. We watched horse-drawn carriages roll down the square, admired the buildings, and visited chocolate shops because if there's one thing you have to do in Belgium, it's sample all their delicious chocolate. So good morning. It is the start of day 2 here in Bruges, so we're going to continue sightseeing. I think the first order of business is to try and find a boat so we can take a little tour down the canals and maybe after that we'll start thinking about food. I know there is a few Belgian dishes that we're itching to try so let's get started with the day. We started off the morning with a cruise down the canals. Like many cities in Europe, Bruges too has earned the nickname 'The Venice of the North' due to the numerous waterways that run through the city. It was a great way to get a closer look at the city, and it didn't hurt that we had swans to keep us company. The boat trip helped build up our appetite, so our next logical stop was a little shop specializing in fries. The Belgians assert that they invented fries and not the French, so we ordered a plateful with mayonnaise and curry ketchup. After eating lunch, we continued exploring the town on foot, and then it was time for dessert. Waffles, waffles! We are having waffles. What do you get when you have a major sweet tooth, if not Belgian waffles doused in chocolate syrup and whipped cream. Delicious! So this is completely unplanned but we just found out we are in town during this crazy music and dance festival. So we've been handed a flier and there is a whole bunch of different workshops happening. You can learn to break-dance, dance the Charleston. You can go to different concerts. So we're going to be spending the evening here in the town just checking it out and visiting the various stages. The Benenwerk Festival was the best surprise of them all! The silent disco was our personal favourite. Everyone wore headphones and there were 2 dueling DJs so you could switch frequencies and decide who you wanted to listen to. After showing off our best dance moves, aherm, we spent the rest of the evening checking out the different stages at the festival. So there has been a lot of dancing involved in the last hour, so now it is time to cool down with our first Belgian beer. Beer o'clock! Cheers! Woo! And that's a wrap for our short but sweet visit to Bruges. Next up: Amsterdam! So we have a very exciting taste test coming up today. We are in Bruges, Belgium and that means we have to try Belgian fries. Not French fries. So let's get a look at that and then I'm going to give you a bit of the history behind it. So there is a bit of a heated debate about whether fries or French fries or Belgian fries. Where exactly did they originate? So our tour guide yesterday was telling us that apparently during World War I there were a lot of British and American soldiers who were between Belgium and France and sometimes they didn't know what country they were in. All they knew is that they could hear French being spoken. So they assumed we must be in France and these must be French Fries. And that is how french fries got their name. But the Belgians believe they were the first to invent this dish and therefore it should be called Belgian fries. I don't really care if they are French or Belgian. All I know is that they are delicious. So I'm ready to dig in to my lunch. Mmmm. So so good. Okay, so tell us about the dressings on these Frites. So over here the main dressing is mayonnaise if you can believe it. And check out that enormous. Generous amount of mayo. Enormous portion of mayo. And then the other sauce that we got over here is curry ketchup. And what is really cool is when you go to these frites stores, these french fry stores you have all different kinds of sauces you can choose from. There is maybe like 20 different kinds. And you have to pay for them but 'hey' it is good. So let's go in for a bite. Alright, I'm taking a curry ketchup and I am dunking it into the mayonnaise. Oh, adventurous. Double sauce adventure. Wow. Yeah, that is like taking french fries to a whole new level. It is absolutely delicious. And something that is really neat about these fries is that they are a thicker cut then what we are used to having. Okay, we are really bad for devouring food but I this like breaks a new record. These were done in like what twenty, thirty, forty seconds as opposed to minutes. It was so good. I'm so sad we finished it so quickly. But my favorite sauce definitely the curry ketchup. I know that is not traditionally Belgian but I tried it the first time when I had currywurst in Berlin and it is so nice having ketchup with curry and I love it with my fries. So I recommend trying that if you get the chance. Yeah, I have to agree with you but they also taste really good mixed together as well. Okay, so price point. How much can we expect to pay for these delicious fries? So we got a medium portion and we paid about 3.50 Euros but if you get a large you can expect to pay maybe 4 and if you get a small you can expect to pay about 2. Another thing to keep in mind is these shops are all over the city. All you have to do is look for the French Fry symbol. On the maps. The maps show you where to get fries. Bahhhh. Bahhhh. So it is time for our last taste test here in Belgium, so we stopped by a chocolate shop to pick up some hand made chocolate. And the Belgians actually used to have a colony in Africa, so that meant cocoa beans, and plenty of time to perfect the art of chocolate making. So that means today they are one of the leading experts in chocolate production, so today is a chocolate taste test. So here are all the chocolates we have purchased. We only have nine, but we are two people, so that might be a bit of an issue. We'll see who gets number nine. And also, we're actually doing this taste test at a local park that has sheep, so if you hear bahhh in the background, that's them and not us. Wait a minute, that's actually not true, sometimes it is us. Bahhhhh. Okay, so time to make your first selection. The neat thing is we got a little assorted goodie bag, so we really don't know what kinds they are, we're just going to try them and see what it is. But I have a feeling this first one I've selected is coffee flavoured. It has a little coffee bean. Yeah, that kind of gives it away. Yeah, start with an easy one, right? Is it coffee? It is. Wow, it's so rich and creamy. Not the healthiest way to start our day, but definitely tasty. Okay, so I have a feeling this one right here is coconut. The shredded coconut kind of gives it away. Mmmm, and it also has a nice creamy feeling. Feeling, filling. A nice creamy filling. Maybe a creamy feeling in your mouth. Mmmmm. That's really good, it's just really rich and milky. It's good chocolate. Alright, I'm going to try what appears to be the first dark chocolate. Ooo, it has a filling! Peppermint. Mint? Oh, I like that, but I don't like dark chocolate so maybe you can have it. Haha, wow, that's a really good peppermint chocolate. Much better than like After Eight or Junior Mints or any of that kind of stuff. Okay, so I'm going for this one. It kind of looks like a little dome. I'm guessing there's filling inside. Aww, I was hoping for strawberry. What is it? Mmm, chocolate fudge in the middle. Still good, I was just hoping for strawberry. You know what wasn't terribly clever on our part? We didn't bring water. Alright I've got a tiny teddy bear shaped chocolate, and teddy you are very cute, but I'm going to eat you. Sorry about that. Okay, oh wow. This has, like, this is the one you wanted. It's got a fruit flavoured jam. Oh my gosh! And you didn't even bite it in half to share. There you go. I win, you lose. That's so sad. So I'm going for a white chocolate. Mmm, I don't know what that is. Can you guess? It's not coffee. Maybe it's praline? Might be praline. Okay, I've got one that's shaped like a leaf now. Mmm, it's all over your lips. It's not mint. Again, I'm not entirely sure what this is. It's got kind of a... Coconut? No, it's not coconut. I would say it's more of a, it's got a bit of a, fruity taste. I'm saying it's going to be peach cream. It's different, but good. So this is going to be my first dark chocolate. I'm usually not a fan, but this one looks really pretty, and it's got the city's main attraction painted in gold. There's the bell tower. Mmm, there's something in it. I think that's marzipan. Probably, I've been noticing a lot of marzipan chocolate around. Ughhhhh. And it has that nasty dried fruit that they put in that Christmas cake. Oh I love that, I love that stuff! It's like old lady candy. Ugh! Since we kind of have a hard time sharing, we're going to do - what? Rock, paper, scissors! Put your hand out. Rock, paper scissors. Kai, bai, bo. Ahhhh! You get the chocolate. You know, I'm going to share it though. Haha, because, ha, I have to put up with you afterwards. No, you're probably just full. You've had too much chocolate. That's why you're willing to share. That's what it is. Okay, last one. Mmm, that's white chocolate with cream. Mmm, a lot of cream. Now I'm going to have a bit of the cookie. Yum! And because I'm such a nice guy, a nice hubby, I'm leaving half of it for you. Mmm, that's nice. Thank you darling! So there's just something about European chocolate that sets it apart from any other chocolate I've had elsewhere. Belgian chocolate is no different, and it's absolutely amazing. It's so milky. So creamy. There's so many different flavours. It's going to be hard to have a normal chocolate bar after this. Price point! Okay, so for these handmade chocolates, and we got 9 little chocolates, we paid 3 Euros and 95 cents, which I think is a pretty good price because it was in a touristy part of town, and I mean, these are outstanding chocolates. So keep that in mind and if you're ever in Bruges, get yourself some chocolates. Waffles! Waffles! We are having waffles! Well, considering today is our last full day in Belgium we couldn't leave the country without trying at least one Belgian waffle. And to prove its authenticity it even has a Belgian flag. Why don't you take out that flag and wave it. Come on, go wave it. Wave the flag? Wave that flag. Belgian waffles, dun da da dun da da. Belgian waffles. dun da da dun dah. So the funny thing about Belgian waffles is that there is no such thing as Belgian waffles in Belgium. Sure, in North America we call them Belgium waffles but here they are just regular old waffles. And that is only because we have crappy waffles. Yes, we have to put them in the toaster. We usually buy them from the frozen section in Canada. But anyway, what sets these waffles apart is that they are a lot larger, a lot fluffier and the squares are a lot bigger than your average waffles that you buy from the frozen section back in North America. So let's dig in before this starts melting. First bite. Okay, so we got ours with chocolate sauce and whipped cream. This is like technically our dinner isn't it? Oh, wow. Wow. Tell me how good that is. That is so good I have no words so I'm just going to take a second bite. And leave me less? Mmmm. I don't even know where to begin. Like, it is amazing. It is a proper waffle guys with lots of chocolate sauce, lots of whipped cream. Nice and sweet. Yes. Oh. You want a flier? And what did you just get handed? We've just been invited to a special event tonight. There is some kind of festival and there is going to be a clubbing stage guys. So, we're going to eat our waffle first and then have energy to go clubbing apparently. Alright, I haven't been left with much but I guess I'll take whatever it is that there is left. Wow. Chocolate sauce and whipping cream is a winning combo. And you're right, those are freshly made waffles done properly. How can I eat the stuff back home after this? So what are the different toppings you can get on these waffles? Lots of different toppings. You can get strawberries, wild berries. There was icing sugar. Even butter. So I mean there is something for every taste out there. Pure butter. Yes, but I'm happy with chocolate. So price point for the waffle? So in terms of this waffle it was 4.50 Euros. Not exactly the cheapest snack but definitely delicious.",False,"20161209 - Visit BRUGES City Travel Guide ∩╜£ What to SEE, DO & EAT in Bruges, Belgium.en.srt"

So we're outside at a little patio right across from our hotel. And we're going to be doing a battle of the soups. We plan on trying two different soups that are from the region of Córdoba, Andalusia in southern Spain. And they are called Gazpacho and Salmorejo. And there is some similarities and some differences between these two cold soups, so we're going to be showing you what those are. So our two soups have arrived. I'm having Gazpacho, Sam is having Salmorejo. And at first glance they do look quite similar. The same color because it is a tomato base but the topping is a little bit different. Now we're going to be actually tasting them and telling you about the ingedients and what sets these two apart. Okay, so time for the first spoonful of Gazpacho. Oh ho ho, baby! Mmmm. That is so good. It is tangy because of the tomato. It is served cold so it is really refreshing. And this one has a lot more ingredients than Salmorejo. So I just put in some chopped bell peppers, green and red peppers. It has also got a bit of onions in there. And it was drizzled with olive oil on top. So a great combination on a hot summer day. I'm just going to keep enjoying this over here. It is so good. So two more things I'll mention about Gazpacho. If you don't want like a full bowl of soup you can actually get it as a drink in a glass and that is cheaper because it is a smaller portion. And also Spanish Gazpacho is really different from Moroccan Gazpacho, which is what I was used to. The Moroccan recipe has chickpeas and beans so don't be surprised if you come to Spain and there are no chickpeas in your Gazpacho. And Gazpacho also comes with a basket of bread on the side. So if you don't want to drink it like a soup you can just dip some bread in there. And almost treat it like a dip. Great either way. And you are having Salmorejo. Tell us what that is like? And that is a little bit different than the Gazpacho. If you look down here you can see that it is a thicker tomato puree. So basically it is thicker. And you'll also notice that there is some egg here. So I'm going to have the first bite to see what it tastes like. You have some egg, ham and olive oil as your toppings. Yeah, it is almost a bit more like a cold stew than a soup. It is definitely thicker. I really like the taste. I like the olive oil drizzled on top too. It just. It is a really awesome dish to have in the summer to cool down. And apparently there is a mystery ingredient here. What is it? Yeah, there is something cool that we discovered upon research. And that is that stale bread is in both of these. In both of these soups. So they soak it in water and then just mix it in with the Gazpacho and the Salmorejo. But you wouldn't be able to tell at first glance. No, you wouldn't. And price point for this meal. So as an appetizer here in Madrid you can pick one up for about five Euros. Or if you want the smaller portion you can get it in a glass for about two to three Euros. Two fifty usually. So it is dinner time in Madrid and today we are here at a local restaurant where we're going to be trying two different dishes. We are planning to eat Paella and something called Fideuà. They are two dishes from the region of Valencia. And there are some similarities and some differences between the two so we'll be showing you those as soon as the plates arrive. The food has arrived. Yes, some I'm going introduce mine first. I am having the Fideua, which is kind of like a noodle Paella, and it is made with Vermicelli noodles which are super thin and mine has mussels, prawns and squid as well as artichoke hearts so let's take a big bite of this. It's hot. That is really nice. Wow. You can really taste the seafood. It is super flavorful. And I also like that the noodles are a little bit overcooked. Like they are nice and soggy, which is how I like them. So I'm quite happy with my meal so far. Okay, so your mixed Paella has arrived. Tell us about it. Yeah, the Paella is finally here. So the mixed Paella has a whole bunch of different things. Let's take a look down at it. So you can see that there is chicken, we've got shrimp, we've got other kinds of seafood, we've got peas and it has got kind of a looks like to be a yellow type of curry sauce. Nice. So let's take the first bite here. This is my favorite Spanish food. The thing I like about it so much is that you have all of these different ingredients and it just has such a flavorful sauce on top of the rice. It is just so good. So if Sam were to try the traditional Paella from Valencia that one would actually have chicken and rabbit because that is what the original recipe calls for. But we're not really used to eating rabbit so that is why we went with the mixed one that has chicken, some seafood and chorizo. So quite a few restaurants in Madrid, and all throughout Spain have Paella on the menu, but the ones that really specialize in it have a special kind of pan. Some come take a look here. And you can see that it is made right in it and brought to your table. And they have the wooden guards on the end that basically probably protect you from getting burnt. Exactly. Well, we certainly polished that off. So now let's talk about the price. Yeah, that was nice and filling. So in terms of price it can vary widely. In more expensive kind of like gourmet restaurants that really specialize in it we've seen it go up to thirty or thirty five Euros. We've never actually ate somewhere like that. The place we went to was eleven Euros. And we thought it was a really good value. We're both really full now. And I've also seen it as an appetizer in some smaller types of restaurants and you can expect maybe to pay seven or eight Euros for that. So it is breakfast time here in Madrid. We've just rolled out of bed at 10 am. Which is a bit unusual. But we're here at a local cafe and we're going to have a traditional Spanish breakfast. So we have ordered a hot chocolate with Churros and Porras. So we're going to show you what those are like in just a few minutes. So this is something that is completely new for me. This is called Porras. And it is basically like a giant sized Churro. Like I've never seen anything like this before. I know, look at that, it's like. It's wider than your shoulders. Hahaha! Alright, so we're going to dip it in the hot chocolate because that is how things are done here. Oh ho ho baby. Mmmmm. That is delicious. It is nice and greasy. And sweet. It is probably not the healthiest way to start the day but 'hey' when in Spain. Hey we're doing it the Spanish way. That is delicious. I'm loving it. What are you having? I'm actually having the proper Churros. This is a deep-fried dough. And what I've found interesting is that when I've had this in Canada it is more of a dessert but over here in Spain it is a breakfast. And it is very popular breakfast item. So let's dip that right in the chocolate. Show us how it is done. Break off a piece here. And that hot chocolate is as thick as it gets. It must have some kind of special ingredients that make it especially thick and rich. It's like mud. It's like chocolate sludge. Wow! Let me just say I could get very used to having this as my normal breakfast. It's that good. So what I find unique about the Spanish Churros is the shape. When we had these in South America they were usually like long little strips. And also there is no filing in these. I still haven't come across any Spanish Churros that have fillings. Whereas in South America they were stuffed with chocolate, vanilla pudding, dulce de leche. So that is another difference. Now let's dip this. Oh la la. This is so good. Mmmm. It is like a wishbone. Hahahaha. So show us what you do with the leftover hot chocolate. You know what. This is a breakfast that is like a gift that keeps on giving. What is left over is a hot chocolate and it is amazing. It is so thick. Like we were talking earlier. It is almost like a sludge but it is really rich and creamy. I think there is extra condensed milk or something. Wonderful. So this is a super affordable breakfast. I've got the menu right next to me. And basically it is two Euros and fifty cents and you get your peach juice, your hot chocolate and either three Churros or three Porras. And yeah, I'm stuffed after all that food. Surprisingly. So it is time for another breakfast here in Madrid. Today we are having the madrileño, which is the local breakfast that everybody likes in this city. And if you look down here you'll be able to see this is Tortilla. Which is a potato and egg type of dish. So it is kind of like a potato and egg omelette. And it is delicious. It comes with a side of bread. And I can't wait to dig in. Oh la la. Look at that. It's so good. It is so good. This is your favorite breakfast. It really is. I've been eating it daily. And on my birthday I had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. That is how much I like it. Okay, so apparently how this dish is made is that the potatoes are first cooked in olive oil and then the egg is added and then it is just flipped over several times until it is done. It really is just like an omelette in a lot of ways. So the Spanish Tortilla has nothing to do with the Mexican Tortilla. The Mexican one is just like one of those big round wraps that you use for Quesadillas and Burritos. But the Spanish Tortilla is completely different even though it shares the same name, so keep that in mind. And also while we're talking about the Spanish Tortilla it can be prepared a few different ways. Like the most simple one of them all is potato and egg but you can also start adding onions, peppers, ham, so you can get a little bit fancier. Okay, so what is the price for this delicious breakfast. This tasty breakfast comes in at around four Euros and usually it comes with a juice. They didn't have any today but it did come with a coffee and bread. And it is a filling breakfast. It is a great way to start our day. And it is definitely one of the things we have the most while we're here in Madrid.",False,20161119 - Spanish Cuisine∩╝Ü Madrid Food Guide.en.srt

Right now we're in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. We've been traveling around the country for three weeks and we've spent ten of those days here in the capital. Yes, and this happens to be our favorite spot out of the two or three different places we've stayed in the city. So we're going to show you around. Let's go. So getting in here is like going into Fort Knox. So much security but we feel really safe even with all of these keys and special magnets. Hahaha. Let's go. Beep. Beep. Key sounds. But before we give you the apartment tour we need to have breakfast and they make a delicious breakfast over here. Yeah, we've been having basically a feast every morning. Uh-huh. And today they switched it up a little bit which is cool. We've been having omelets previously and kind of rolled up crepes with jam but if you take a look down here you can see we've got fried eggs, it looks like we have some ham, tomatoes, cucumber and then we have a different style of pancake here and it looks like little dollops of jam. We have toast, we have orange juice. Juice. And coffee. Is it coffee or tea? It is coffee. Oh, it is coffee. Again they switched it up. Oooh. But yeah that is a lot of food for two people. Look at the table. And the cool thing about this type of place is that you kind of you get comforts of an apartment but we're getting a little bit of the service of a hotel. Like having breakfast prepared for us in the morning. The best of both worlds. It really is. It really is. Alright, let's dig in. Okay, grabbing some egg and a bit of ham. It is tasty. So now that we've had our breakfast it is time for the grand tour so we're going to show you around our one bedroom apartment. So come in. This is like I guess our little lobby area. Do you have a lobby area in an apartment. It is probably called something else. Hahaha. The cloakroom area. So this is where the shoes are kept. Shoes, umbrellas and you can hang up your coats over here. And then it kind of goes straight into the kitchen and we actually have a pretty nice modern kitchen. I really like it. Yeah. And we've got a washing machine. We do. That is like. When we decide to rent an apartments as opposed to staying in a hotel that is like the number one feature. It is one of the best things aside from having our own fridge of course too. So we have an electric range so we can cook. We have a kettle, no microwave but we haven't really needed that. We've mostly been eating out. Oh, guess what? We do have one. Hahaha. We haven't needed it though in all fairness because we have been eating out a lot and we've been having our breakfast served to us as well. So yeah, this is our little breakfast nook. This is where we have breakfast every morning. Yeah, as you can see the dirty dishes. Okay, next we'll show you the bathroom since it is right across from the kitchen. So here we go. Tada. So we kind of have like this walk in shower. This shower, I have to say is like. Open it up for us. It is almost like a 5 star shower. Like the quality is incredible. The water pressure. Like check out that thing. It is huge. So yeah, that is our bathroom and then I'll take you into the bedroom. This is just a one bedroom apartment so it is pretty small. Come in. So yeah, I guess you could call this like the bedroom slash living area. So we have a double bed but we also have some couches over here where we can work do our thing on the computer. Um, so yeah I mean it is enough space for two people. It is really all you need and we have a bit of storage as well. We haven't really unpacked our stuff since it is a short stay. Yeah. And the weather has been really nice so we haven't had to unpack much of our cold weather gear. We've got storage, a TV and we have a little balcony. I'll show you that. So I'll just move these away. This is actually where I put the laundry out to dry because it is pretty hot out there. And I'll show you the view. You basically look out over the courtyard which is cool. Yeah, there is like a little playground for kids and then way off in the distance here. The zoom will take a little while you can see it is kind of either an unfinished or an abandoned building. And that is kind of a major landmark because we stayed two blocks from there at a hotel before. So totally recognize that building. So that is a wrap for our little Bishkek apartment tour. Yeah, so basically it was really cool staying here because I felt like we got to a little bit of window into the culture. The Soviet Era complex apartment buildings. Like these massive buildings. We're getting to stay in here and even though we're like on the first or second level. First level. We're not near the top it is still really cool and it is just like whenever you can stay in apartments as opposed to a hotel it is always like so much better because you feel a little bit like you're at home, you have more space you have more amenities, you have kitchen where you can wash your clothes. So whenever we have that opportunity we tend to take it. Yes, oh and another important thing it is cheaper than the hotel too. So now if you're thinking of traveling to Bishkek (Бишкек) or perhaps moving here now you have a better idea of what the apartments look like. Yeah, exactly. So I hope you enjoyed this tour and if you've been to Bishkek (Бишкек) before let us know what your apartment experience or hotel experience was like.

Berlin was a city bursting with art and music and we were very excited to spend some time there here is our list of the 25 best things to do in Berlin the East Side Gallery is the longest remaining strip of the former dividing wall between East and West Berlin today the 1.3 km long wall stands as a memorial to freedom and it is covered in art and [Music] graffiti so right now we are visiting Brandenburg gate and this gate dates back to the 18th century and it used to be one of the old Gates leading into the city now after the wall came down in 1989 this became a symbol of unity between East and West Germany so it's an important site to visit and just behind the gate is the hotel Adlon this is where Michael Jackson infamously dangled the [Music] baby so we're here at tear Garden one of the biggest parks in the city and it's a nice quiet green Escape From the City Center we're loving just walking around this park actually used to be the king's hunting grounds because it is full of wild wild deer and other [Music] animals Mau Park is a hipster hangout every Sunday people flock to this park and spend the day barbecuing listening to music enjoying a few beers and simply having a good time there's a popular flea market where you can pick up old vinyls and clothes and if you head over to the Bear Pit you can catch some karaoke and musical [Music] [Music] performances if you want to spot some cool street art then head over to friederick sign this neighborhood is home to a lot of old warehouses turn cafes and art galleries and they exude A Very Cool [Music] vibe you can't come to Berlin and not eat a curry worst this is the city's most popular fast food snack the sausage is served with a ketchup and curry powder concoction it's delicious [Music] so up next we're at the Reich stack building which has a pretty cool glass Dome on Top This Dome is actually open to visitors and it offers 360° views of the city but the only thing is that you need to sign up well in [Music] advance today we're visiting Temple Hoff a repurposed airport here in Berlin and this is the first time I must say I've ever walked on a Runway what's so cool about this park is that it has been repurposed and now people are enjoying all kinds of leisure and recreation activities there's a dog park there's people inline skating riding bicycles jogging walking having picnics this is such an awesome place just to come and hang [Music] out so if you enjoy museums and art G galleries you'll want to visit Berlin's Museum Island they actually have five different museums here and if you get a daily pass for €18 you get access to all [Music] five we are now visiting the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin it's also known as the memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe and the artist's idea when he was creating this was to create a sense of confusion and uneasiness when you walk through the memorial um yet it's very orderly at the same time and that's supposed to mimic the the Nazi regime so we're going to be showing you this [Music] area charlottenberg Palace is largest Palace in Berlin and the only surviving Royal residence in the city it was home to Queen Sophia charlot and the interior is quite Grand once you've browsed through the many halls and ballrooms you should head out to the beautiful gardens in the [Music] back Checkpoint Charlie was one of the crossing points between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War today you can get your passport stamp with the stamps of the former [Music] sectors located near Alexander Platz the TV tower offers a great Lookout over the city M Chocolate Ritter sport is a chocolate brand that is sold all over Germany and while in Berlin we couldn't resist sampling a few of the different [Music] varieties Berlin Cathedral is located on museum Island and it's one of the most beautiful churches in the city you wouldn't be able to tell by looking at it today but the Dome was severely damaged during the second World War [Music] if Curry worst is to your liking you'll want to check out this quirky Museum devoted to Berlin's favorite sausage one of the coolest things about this museum is that they have a giant sofa shaped like a curry worst [Music] renting a bike is a great way to get around the city and most places will rent out bikes for €1 a [Music] day for a leisurely afternoon hop on a boat and enjoy a tour down the river spree [Music] and of course you can't come to Berlin and not eat a wor or a sausage I've just ordered myself one from the street they have lots of local stands and this was only €135 Big Bite I'm so good and I got it with mustard which is even tastier the friedi sign flea market takes place every Sunday and it's a great place for people watching and a little browsing you'll find all sorts of items for sale ranging from old musical instruments to antique dish wear this Market draws big crowds [Music] the Germans sure know how to enjoy a hearty breakfast and we recommend you try it too breakfast usually offers a wide sampling of Loaves and bread rolls accompanied with various delic cuts and [Music] cheese we couldn't resist visi sitting yet another Cat Cafe while we were in Berlin unlike the cafes we had previously visited in Asia this one was quite small and only had two cats but if you're a cat lover you might just enjoy pee pe's cats and [Music] Cafe while in Berlin we enjoyed a hearty meal of schnitzel this thin strip of meat is coated in flour eggs and breadcrumbs before being deep fried you can order it with a side of mashed potatoes or German noodles known as [Music] petla it's quite easy to get around Berlin using the uban and esbon system you can go almost anywhere plus it's really affordable [Music] [Applause] in Berlin there's a big Turkish population and that means there's awesome Turkish street food right here I've got a dona in front of me and it only costs €350 and this thing is a massive Behemoth I can't wait to take the first bite yeah amazing [Music] and that's Berlin for you a city that has risen From the Ashes of the war which is now bursting with art music and life have you been to Berlin we'd love to hear your favorite things about the city in the comments below for more travel and food videos hit subscribe [Music] so right now we are visiting Berlin which is our fourth and final stop of our bus about tour this is actually one of my favorite cities in Europe So today we're going to be running around town and showing you some of the highlights Berlin is a city that we are always happy to go back to and being here in the summertime was a lot of fun we divided our time by visiting some of the main attractions by day and then enjoying some of the Night Life by [Music] night so here is a lesson in travel planning one of the coolest things you can do in Berlin is come and climb the glass Dome on top of the rice tag building now in order to do so you have to make reservations online well in advance and unfortunately we procrastinated a little little too long and all the slots were filled up so now we don't get to go up the dome which is so sad so instead we're admiring it from a [Music] distance outside of turkey I'd say Berlin is one of the best places to sample Turkish food we couldn't resist going back to our favorite donor Kebab stand in Alexander plats for a tasty lunch here outside of Brandon gate a pretty iconic landmark and next we're going to visit teer Garden today the gate is seen as a symbol of Freedom since it's where people gathered to celebrate when the Berlin Wall came down right now we're visiting tear Garden one of our favorite green spaces in the city and it used to be the former Royal hunting grounds we also made time to swing by Museum island with a total of five museums this is the place to be if you're an art lover later on in the day we took the train to frickin cburg which is the epicenter of Berlin's cool Factor this is a burrow known for its street art flea markets booming music scene and overall is a great place for NTI so we are now standing in front of the East side Gallery which used to be the wall that divided West Berlin from East Berlin and we're just going to be walking the length of it and showing you some of the artwork the stretch left standing is 1.3 km in length and it displays over 100 paintings from artists all over the world some pieces are a little abstract but the majority have clear messages of Hope and [Music] peace from there we continued on to the overbound bridge which turned into a bit of a street party when the Sun goes down several bands had set up along the length of the bridge and you could listen to everything from Urban beats to indie rock who needs to pay admission at a club when you can dance on Berlin streets for free and that's the cool thing about Berlin when it comes to nightlife it doesn't matter what night of the week it is there's always something happening after checking out some of the Bands we found a cool gravel lot turned pop-up bar and we enjoyed a few drinks as the sun set over the city [Music] [Music] what up it's really cool I got to see this fand play on the street and I saw them a year ago in Berlin at Ma Park so it's really awesome I just got to pick up their CD they are called roer's kitchen Orchestra oh shots and snacks are you getting the shots or are you getting the snacks I'm getting the shots oh Sam just found a makeshift bar on the side of the road cuz that's how it's done in Berlin having sambuka sambuka for Sam I mean licorice heaven right now sipping it's sh sipping on licorice Heaven I am savoring this okay and that's a wrap for Berlin and a farewell to the BS of boat crew so we have made it to Berlin and that means today we are going to introduce you to a really popular fast food snack that you can get here in the city the Donaire Kebab so Donaire Kebab you're probably thinking isn't that Turkish and yes it is Turkish but Germany has a huge Turkish population and that means they brought their recipes and their food over and they've actually adapted the Donaire Kebab to kind of fit the German taste when it comes to the cuisine so this would be considered a German donor Kebab so I'm going to bite right in because this looks so good and we've been filming it for too long so we sure have it's spite [Music] here messy so so good oh I'm losing toppings and there's a bee trying to steal my food no so the place where we picked it up you could choose from a number of different toppings they had chicken and feel and they had it right on that big rump where you know they're shaving it off SK oh skewer so good and I'll show you some of the toppings in here if we take a look so you have things like tomatoes lettuce and other things like that of course this is a chicken but what makes it kind of uh unique for Germany here is that it has cabbage cabbage and onions Germans really like that yeah all right time for my first bite oh my go he dropped it all over the place all over the place I have an onion on my wrist emergency is it good oh yeah it's really good and the nice thing is this is a really cheap meal and you can share it with someone so another thing I'm noticing while I'm eating this is that the donor Kebab actually has grilled veggies and that's not something I've ever had anywhere else before so I'm kind of wondering if that's also one of the German adaptations or if it is done in Turkey um and in terms of the sauces I can a really hot and spicy sauce they have a few different herb sauces garlic sauce and a yogurt based sauce so lots of variety there yeah I'm just going to get back to eating this cuz it's so good we ended up getting the hot sauce yeah M and price point for that delicious donor Kebab so that was only €350 and what's really cool about this is you can find these kebabs almost everywhere we picked this one up at a metro station you can also find them on the street and we highly recommend you go and GAP one while you're in [Music] Berlin for 28 years the Berlin Wall acted as a dividing line between East and West Berlin after Germany reunified most of the wall was demolished but today some stretches remain as a reminder of the past but also as a memorial for [Music] [Music] Freedom the East Side Gallery was painted in 1990 with more than 100 artists involved in the project today the East Side Gallery is the largest and longest Las open air Gallery in the world if you're in Berlin for a visit be sure to swing [Music] [Music] by we really enjoyed seeing the diverse works of art and we recommend visiting on a weekday to eat the [Music] crowd we visited cat cafes in three different countries one in Korea one in Thailand and one in Malaysia and this is going to be our first in Germany this one is called Peep's katson Cafe as soon as we walked into pee's cats and Cafe two very energetic young cats greeted us as friendly as could be they came over to sniff our bags clothes and shoes before turning their attention to what was going on outside of the window although it was just the two of them they certainly gave us enough attention while providing plenty of entertainment as we sipped on tea and ate cake it wasn't soon before they started to play with one another tearing around the room and leaping from pole to pole soon play turned to fighting they really went at it for a while blue versus red for anyone who has had a young cat as a pet this is certainly normal behavior and it made us laugh [Music] [Music] [Music] not long after they started to settle down a bit for an afternoon nap so this Cafe was quite different from the ones we have visited in Asia for starters it was quite small and they only had two cats to play with us also they didn't have a lot of toys which makes it a little difficult to be interactive with the cats cuz it's difficult to lure them your way but overall it was a nice little place to drink some tea and have cake with some cats for company so the total cost of the Cat Cafe was 8 year- that allowed us to get two teas and a slice of cake which is quite affordable we thought sausage man my new best friend so you can't come to Berlin and not have Cur worst actually yesterday was the very first time I tried it and I instantly loved it today we're going to be trying two different kinds of Curry WS we're going to be trying some from the East side and also some from the west side and they're completely different so the curry verse is considered fast food here in Germany so it's a sausage that is steamed then fried it's sliced up and it's served with ketchup and curry powder over top [Music] delicious first [Music] bite it's amazing I've been eating these since I first got to Berlin and I haven't gotten sick of them they are so tasty sure I get lots of curry sauce online oh wow I can see why these are very popular in Germany and if just eating Curry worst isn't enough for you one of the more quirky attractions in Berlin is visiting the Curry worst Museum where of course apparently you get to have Curry worst at the end of your tour so the sausage can be eaten many different ways today I got it with french fries but you can order it in a bun with a side of sauerkraut or even with a big potato so you're not limited for options so you can typically pick up a career worse for anywhere between €250 to3 just on its own and if you want to get a side like fries usually is about5 good morning so since we're hanging out in Germany these days we thought we would show you what a German breakfast looks like so we've set up the table and as you can see it consists of a lot of different breads like we have a few buns here and also Meats Germans like to have salami ham and just different Deli cuts for breakfast we also have a few different cheeses smoked salmon and of course you can't forget mle um so yeah it's been a very nice change in diet since we've left Asia yeah I'd say quite the feast I must say as well yeah this is a completely different type of meal from what we were having in Asia most of the time in Asia we would have meals and breakfast consisting of rice noodle dishes sometimes dim some so this is a much hardier type of [Music] meal so one of the big changes since leaving Asia is that we're actually eating all of our breakfasts at home in the kitchen table um whereas in Asia we were often going to a little market or like little Street stalls where they prepared the food in front of us so it's in a way it's kind of nice just rolling out of bed in your pajamas and being able to eat at home without having to get dressed with your bed hair and everything anyways enough talking it's time to dig in yes [Music] and that can includes breakfast we certainly took care of things and now we just have empty plates in front of us and a whole lot of dishwashing to [Music] do so you can't come to Germany and not order schnitzel so that is what we're having today for lunch schnitzel is basically uh a breaded cutlet this one that I'm having is supp and you can get it either with mashed potatoes potato wedges or french fries so I'm having it with a potato salad [Music] today so first bite here with the champion sauce M tend really tender and I really like the cre creamy sauce over top that is so tender and tasty there are a few variations of schnitzel around the world in Argentina for example we have something called milanesa which is a breaded cutlet and it's normally made out of V but you can also get beef or chicken and in Korea and Japan you can get something called ton KATU which is once again breaded pork CA it's delicious but I prefer the German snle more the total came to just under €1 and I thought it was a very affordable meal for [Music] lunch for today's video you are in for a sweet treat quite literally because we are in Germany and we've decided to taste test a few of our favorite chocolates chocol brand we are testing is Ritter Sport and we have six different varieties let's show them so you've got three in your hand I've got three in mine and we're going to be trying all of these and letting you know what our favorites are now the first thing to know is that there's a special way to open these and Audrey is going to show us I'm a pro watch this that one malfunctions one more you just crack it open o la Chola okay so the first kind we're going to be trying is this yellow pack and it's a cornflake chocolate it's regular milk chocolate but stuffed with corn flakes I've never had chocolate with corn flakes before but I like both things so I have high expectations here I've had this before and it's one of my favorites wa each oh wow that's a crunchy one how do you like it it's amazing it reminds me of a chocolate we have in North America I think it's called crunch or crunchy it is like a crunchy bar mhm but this this is better [Applause] M the next one we're trying is the red package this is marzipan um and it's basically an almond paste made with honey and sugar so that's the filling inside this chocolate it also looks like it's a darker chocolate I'm not a fan of dark chocolate I prefer milk chocolate so we'll see how this goes here [Music] that's very rich and [Music] decadent you like it I prefer milk chocolate i' I've already said that um it's not my favorite but the marip pan is very sweet so that kind of balances the bitterness of the dark chocolate so it's okay oh I need water okay now this is the one I've been really wanting to have I'm a huge fan fan of peppermint chocolate and Ritter sport is high quality chocolate so I have very high expectations for this okay let's give it a try [Music] right M oh [Music] wow what do you think it's a lot like those after eight really thin chocolate strips most of it reminds me of yeah mhm oh that's really good it's like a it's also like the Junior Mints that we have in North America as well number four so this one is the espresso flavor and do you normally like espresso I do not like coffee so no espresso for me yeah we're not coffee drinkers so not sure how we're going to like these [Music] ones this is torture [Music] okay it has a strong coffee flavor but it smelled chocolate not dark chocolate so it's bearable I think if you put enough sugar in anything you can make it taste good so even though I don't like this flavor normally I actually quite like it in chocolate form okay next up we have a new flavor that I haven't seen before it's called Olympia and it has yogurt honey nuts and grape sugar if my translation is correct so sounds interesting let's see take a square [Music] e oh that's an interesting one you like it it doesn't have a very distinct flavor considering it has form unique ingredients in the filling yeah I agree with that and I just coughed on the chocolate so that I get the rest of it afterwards not a bad strategy huh last but certainly not least we have coconut and I am a huge coconut fan you think you're going to like this one I've actually been having this chocolate when Sam's known around i r into the supermarket and get a square for myself go before he has I'm just finding this out now it's evil here you go this is the best one in my opinion this looks so good I'm taking two squares oh wow it's like big chunks of coconut that's it's creamy it's sweet I feel like I'm back in the tropics enjoying a coconut Shake that's by far the best one as far as I'm concerned so I'm going to choose my top two and if I had to rank them I'd say coconut number one and maybe the cornflakes number two I really enjoyed those what about you well for me I would go coconut also number one but then I would go peppermint number two so I think we figured out something quite important here if we were to buy the coconut flavored Ritter sport we're going to be fighting over it quite literally give it to me if any of you chocolate lovers find yourselves in Germany there is actually a Ritter sport chocolate factory located outside of studart I went there a couple of years ago and their chocolate store is amazing they have so much variety and all the packaging is so colorful so you can certainly spend a few hours there picking up souvenirs to take back home or to eat before you go back home so so if you're in Germany traveling and you want to try the Ritter sport they're 9 cents of a Euro so a little history into this chocolate bar as you can see it's a square shape because it was actually meant to fit inside of a gentleman's Blazer inside the the front pocket so that if they were ever at the theater or at the cinema and they needed something to munch on they could discreetly pull it out and have their Ritter sport yum that's clever yeah [Music] I'm us need to spit out you didn't like that oh gosh PR so dramatic the longer I keep it in my mouth and worth it get jeez it's been weird this one coconut me I only talked the way are you you want to do this one sure,False,"20160620 - Visit BERLIN City Guide ∩╜£ What to SEE, DO & EAT in Berlin, Germany.en.srt"

Time for a new destination. This is a city that I haven't visited in almost 4 years and it is actually Sam's very first time here. So we're both very excited to be in London. And we're going to be making a little video guide. Actually a really big video guide because we plan on showing you 50 different things to do around London. So let's get started. London is one of the most visited cities in the whole world, and it's easy to see why. It is vibrant, it is exciting, and there's something to do every single night of the week. You could spend a full year in London and never run out of new places to visit, but since we were a bit more limited with our time, we decided to film a city guide highlighting 50 things to do in London. We hope this will help showcase some of the sights and attractions this city has to offer, and that it'll come in handy for anyone out there planning a trip. Let's begin! Our first stop was Trafalgar Square. This square leads to a lot of central attractions, so it's a nice place to people watch, get your bearings, and plan out where you want to go in the city. St Martin-in-the-Fields is an Anglican church at the north-east corner of Trafalgar Square. They hold classical concerts and they also have a cafe located in the crypt if you want to grab a bite of food in an unusual setting. The London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel on the South Bank of the Thames. It offers a bird's eye view of the city - just make sure you don't go on a foggy day. It is lunchtime. In my hands I have a box of delicious take-out. This is fish and chips an authentic British staple and we're going to sample it here at this local park. So I'm really excited to finally try the fish and chips. The aroma coming out of this box is just wonderful. And I think this is a dish that most people are familiar with in North America. You can also get fish and chips there. But in case you're not it is usually just breaded cod or haddock and you get it with chips are french fries. So enough talking about food. This is the real deal. Let's actually dig in. Oh, I'm going to dunk that into the tartar sauce. Wow. That's amazing. I think that is pretty much my favorite British food. Absolutely love fish and chips. It is something I've been eating all of my life but they just do it extra special over here. It is authentic and it is really really amazing. And you have a few pigeons trying to steal your food. They are slowly inching their way over. Oooh. Oooh. Right now we're visiting Borough Market, one of London's most famous markets. And there is a lot of wonderful smells right now so we're going to check it out. Dating back to the thirteenth century, Borough Market is the oldest market in London. It's a foodie's paradise with plenty of fresh produce, baked goods, and specialty foods. One fun way to get around London is aboard the iconic double-decker buses. You can opt for public transport, or take the double-decker sightseeing tours around the city. We are now about to travel to a magical place. We are here at Platform 9 3/4 in King's Cross and we are going to take a train to Hogwarts. This is a must for Harry Potter fans! Alright, so next up we're off to Buckingham Palace to see if we can visit the Queen. Oh my! Buckingham Palace has served as the official London residence for Britain's sovereigns since 1837. The State Rooms at Buckingham Palace are open to visitors every year, however, that's something that you need to plan months in advance. We're here now to watch the Changing of the Guard. Clearly, we didn't come early enough. We came about 30 minutes prior to it starting but it was already packed. St. James' Park connects Buckingham Palace to the Horse Guards. It's a nice leisurely walk with plenty of wildlife and nature. The Palace of Westminster, also known as the Houses of Parliament, is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The Palace along with Big Ben are two of the top London attractions that dot the city-scape. We are now at Regent's Park here in London and it's a beautiful day outside so we're just going to go take a stroll. Regent's Park is in northwest London. It is home to an Open Air Theatre, the London Zoo, as well as a variety of cafes and restaurants. Westminster Abbey is right around the corner from the Houses of Parliament, and despite the long lines, it's worth a visit. The Abbey has been the coronation church since 1066 and is the final resting place of seventeen monarchs. You can also visit the Horse Guards and the Household Cavalry Museum, which are right next to each other. The HMS Belfast is a museum ship moored on the River Thames. It is operated by the Imperial War Museum, and once you're on-board you can freely roam around the ship. So we are going to have tea aboard the HMS Belfast. I've got my scone with butter and jam. No Cornish cream unfortunately. And yeah, I don't think I've ever had tea on a boat before. On a ship. Another way to see London is to take a river cruise of the Thames. There are a variety of cruises available including dinner cruises, afternoon tea cruises, or your regular sightseeing cruises. So it is getting quite chilly over here but we're going to cross this bridge right behind me and I'd like to point out this is Tower Bridge not London Bridge. London Bridge is very plain, very simple. A little bit ugly. The Tower of London sits on the north bank of the River Thames. Though this castle served many purposes, it's mainly remembered for its use as a prison in the 16th and 17th centuries. Traitors! God Save the King! From the outside this place actually looks really small but once you get inside it is almost like a mini city. So next up we're heading into one of my favorite museums in all of London. This is the Tate Modern. The Tate Modern is housed in the former Bankside Power Station and it focuses on modern and contemporary art from the 1900 to the present. Alright, so good morning from London. We are up bright and early to do some sightseeing around town. But first up we need our energy so we've stopped at a pub for a full English breakfast. Ooh, look at that. So what exactly is in a full English breakfast? Alright, so before we tuck into this breakfast let's take a look at what we've got. So we have toast over here. We've got sausage. We've got baked beans, egg, tomato, hash browns and bacon. So that is going to be a lot of calories. That seems quite complete. Yes. Alright, I'm loading up a little bit of everything on here. So I've got my beans, my hash browns and the sausage. You know what? It's very greasy, very hearty, it is almost like having lunch for breakfast but it tastes really good. I'm really hungry right now so I'm just going to keep working at it. Right now I'm visiting Arsenal Football Club, one of the most popular teams in London. And I just picked up a hat. I've been collecting a series of hats of different football clubs from all of the cities I've been visiting in Europe. And what you can do here of course is watch a game during the season and if it is the off-season you can check out the team store or take a stadium tour. Camden Market is made up of a series of markets and stalls. It is the place to shop for vintage clothes, get a new piercing, people watch, or sample international food in an outdoor setting. On a sunny day, you'll also find people hanging out along Camden Lock. Okay, so this afternoon we're at a place called Cereal Killer Cafe where you can have breakfast anytime of day in the form of cereal. So I've got myself some Fruit Loops and Lucky Charms and some coconut milk. Oh ho ho. A little bit of sugar in there. Ah, yeah. It's going to be good. Mmmmm. My two favorite cereals. It's like being a kid all over again. And what are you having this afternoon? I'm having Reese's Peanut Butter Puffs because chocolate and peanut butter is a winning combo. Take a look. I'm going with coconut milk as well. Almost as good as a chocolate bar. Okay, so it is tea time and this afternoon we're doing something a little bit different. We are in Camden town at the basement tea rooms. And it is kind of like an alternative experience. Instead of going out for afternoon tea at the Ritz, at a fancy hotel that might cost you around 50 pounds. Here it is only 13 and it is a very casual laid back experience. So, waiting for my tea. Feeling pretty relaxed over there? Nothing like having tea in bed. So my absolute favorite thing about afternoon tea is getting scones with cream and jam. And we've got six whole scones. My goodness! Not just any cream. Cornish clotted cream. My happy place. Alright, we tried the sweets. Time for me to have the savory sandwich. Little finger sandwiches. What kind of sandwich is it? It's delicious. It has cream cheese and salmon. Wow! That is why you haven't been sharing because it has salmon. That's right. You've been keeping it a secret. Is someone going to take a little afternoon nap after all that food. Another fun thing to do in London is to check out the street art. One of the best places to do so is in Shoreditch. Of course, the London experience wouldn't be complete without riding the tube around the city. Just remember, pass on the left, stand on the right, and have your pass ready to scan on the way in and out. If you can remember all of these things, you'll make Londoners very happy! So as a money saving tip when you're in London definitely consider purchasing an Oyster Card. We've been using it a lot on the Tube. It helps us save a lot of money. You can load it, reload it and you can use it just basically anywhere you go. Another alternative for getting around the city is to use the city's bike hire system. Though this is best if you're exploring outside central London where traffic isn't so heavy. So now we are having lunch at Convent Garden and I have a beautiful balloon art instillation happening behind my head. It looks like I'm floating through the clouds. We also have some opera drifting through, so it feels pretty fancy but we're actually having Shake Shack for lunch because we really like our North American burgers. We're going shopping inside Harrods. How fancy! Harrods is an upscale department store. If you make it all the way out here, we suggest visiting their food court which is truly impressive (and expensive!) Pub's are an important part of the culture, so make time to drop by for a pint of beer or two. St. Paul's is one of the most easily recognized landmarks in the city. If you don't have a problem with heights, climbing to the top of the dome is a pretty cool experience. Shakespeare's Globe is a modern construction of the original theatre associated with William Shakespeare. The theater sits around 230 meters away from the site of the original theatre. The Natural History Museum focuses on life and earth sciences, and it's a popular one with families. The Victoria & Albert museum is focused on the decorative arts and design. It spans 5000 years of art ranging from ceramics to textiles, and jewellery to furniture. If you want to catch a theatre performance, London's West End is the place to be. Next up, If you haven't had your fill of palaces, you can always swing by Kensington Palace which is set in Kensington Garden. They also have an exhibit of beautiful gowns worn by the royals. The Sherlock Holmes Museum is a privately run museum in London. It is dedicated to the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and it sits on Baker Street. The Shard is a 95-storey skyscraper in London. It is currently home to the city's highest viewing platform. You can alternatively go up to the Walkie Talkie building, soak in the views, and visit the Sky Garden. The British Museum focuses on the art, history, and culture of the world. The collection spans over 8 million objects. Portobello Road is a street in Notting Hill. While you can visit any day of the week, it is most popular for its Saturday market. So one spot you should definitely make time for when you come to the Regent's Park is Queen Mary's Gardens. And there are lots roses here. And the ones right over here on my left are called the Pride of England. Very beautiful. Very impressive. Regent's Canal is over 13 kilometres long and you'll find many house boats moored here. It's also a popular spot with joggers and bikers. For a little bit of art in your life, you can check out the National Gallery which sits right behind Trafalgar Square. Then just up the street, you'll find the National Portrait Gallery, which houses a collection of portraits of historical and famous British people. So today we are having something called a Steak and Ale pie. And this is something that Sam has been very excited about so time for the unveil. Tell us about this dish. I first tried this in Edinburgh, Scotland about a year and a half ago and fell in love with it. So it is basically like a pastry. You can see right here. And inside of it you've got stewed meat, you've got veggies and of course ale. Let's check it out. And there is also gravy as well. Crispy. Sounds real crispy. Maybe you should just use your hands and forget about the spoon. Alright. Here we go. Mmmmm. Wow. That pastry filing or sorry not filing outer layer is delicious. And the next bite should be the middle layer. Okay, so they also gave us a little bit of gravy. I'm not even sure if we're supposed to be doing this but we're just going to pour it all over the meat pie. Yeah, why not. Make it a little soggy. That's how Canadians eat British food. And I'm just going to go ahead and throw some peas on there while I'm at it. Why not? Why not. Time for your first bite. See if you can get it into the middle inner layer there. Inner layer? The filing? Yeah. Exactly. Okay, this probably would have been a lot messier if we just ate it at the pub. Mmmm. Wow. That is good stuff. What do we have in here? Okay, so this is steak. I don't think this one has veggies actually. So I think we maybe just got a standard meat pie because there are no veggies in the filling that I've come across so far. Well, the peas we threw in. Well, yeah, that makes it kind of healthy right? Um, it is really nice with the gravy because our, I guess the pastry was a little crispy, so that makes it a little soggier and easier to get at. Um, so yeah, I'm really enjoying this. It's pretty good. The Churchill War Rooms are home to an underground complex that was the British command centre throughout the Second World War. The museum also explores the life of Winston Churchill. And lastly, there's Madame Tussaud's wax museum, which will give you a glimpse of UK celebrities. And that's a wrap for London! Like with any mega-city, it's impossible to cover all the sights and attractions you can enjoy here, but hopefully this video will give you an idea of what London has to offer. As always, if you have any other suggestions of things to do in London that you'd like to share with other travellers, feel free to include those in the comments below. Okay, so it is tea time and this afternoon we're doing something a little bit different. We are in Camden town at the basement tea rooms. And it is kind of like an alternative experience. Instead of going out for afternoon tea at the Ritz, at a fancy hotel that might cost you around 50 pounds. Here it is only 13 and it is a very casual laid back experience. So, waiting for my tea. Feeling pretty relaxed over there? Nothing like having tea in bed. So my absolute favorite thing about afternoon tea is getting scones with cream and jam. And we've got six whole scones. My goodness! Not just any cream. Cornish clotted cream. My happy place. Alright, we tried the sweets. Time for me to have the savory sandwich. Little finger sandwiches. What kind of sandwich is it? It's delicious. It has cream cheese and salmon. Wow! That is why you haven't been sharing because it has salmon. That's right. You've been keeping it a secret. Alright, and we have one more to try here. This one is on whole wheat bread. It appears to be egg salad with spinach. Tasty. I like the salmon one better though. It's all over your mouth. Is someone going to take a little afternoon nap after all that food. Snoring. And after tea you can do a little bit of shopping. That was really good afternoon tea. Total bargain. Normally you'd be looking at spending anywhere say between 20 to 50 pounds per person. And we got that for thirteen something. Total. Wow! It is lunchtime. In my hands I have a box of delicious take-out. This is fish and chips an authentic British staple and we're going to sample it here at this local park. Time for the big unveil. Do do do do. Woah! Okay, the last one too. Oh, it looks like they gave us guacamole. Are you serious? I've never had guacamole with fish and chips. So I'm really excited to finally try the fish and chips. The aroma coming out of this box is just wonderful. And I think this is a dish that most people are familiar with in North America. You can also get fish and chips there. But in case you're not it is usually just breaded cod or haddock and you get it with chips are french fries. So enough talking about food. This is the real deal. Let's actually dig in. Mmmmm. I'm going to start with a chip. And that is not guacamole. Mmmm. I have no idea what that is. Mushy peas? I think I'm having mushy peas. It is not guacamole. Oh my gosh. Hahahaha. Why would there be guacamole? I don't know. Mexican influence. Oh, I'm going to dunk that into the tartar sauce. Wow. That's amazing. I think that is pretty much my favorite British food. Absolutely love fish and chips. It is something I've been eating all of my life but they just do it extra special over here. It is authentic and it is really really amazing. And you have a few pigeons trying to steal your food. They are slowly inching their way over. Oooh. Oooh. So what kind of historical or background information can you can give us on fish and chips. Well, I can tell you today, this day in history that we spent about two minutes to finish that off. All that is left is a little bit of sauce and grease. Now some history about the dish. The first shop opened up in 1860 and so I guess it has only been around for a hundred and fifty years. That is hard to believe. So fish and chips are kind of new. Yeah, and I've been eating them for about 30 of those years. And price point. So in terms of price we paid 12 pounds which I guess if you're earning a local salary isn't so bad but if you're bringing over your Canadian dollars you're getting pounded by the exchange currently. Anyways, yeah, that was really good. It was enough food for the two of us. I mean, I probably could have ate my own but that is only because I'm a pig. Well hello, we are in London where the weather doesn't appear to be cooperating. It was beautiful and sunny about two minutes ago so we came here to the park thinking 'hey' we'll have a picnic and it has since started pouring rain. So we are doing a little taste test under a tree. So today we are having something called a Steak and Ale pie. And this is something that Sam has been very excited about so time for the unveil. Tell us about this dish. I first tried this in Edinburgh, Scotland about a year and a half ago and fell in love with it. So it is basically like a pastry. You can see right here. And inside of it you've got stewed meat, you've got veggies and of course ale. Let's check it out. And there is also gravy as well. Crispy. Sounds real crispy. Maybe you should just use your hands and forget about the spoon. Alright. Here we go. Mmmmm. Wow. That pastry filing or sorry not filing outer layer is delicious. Okay, so they also gave us a little bit of gravy. I'm not even sure if we're supposed to be doing this but we're just going to pour it all over the meat pie. Yeah, why not. Make it a little soggy. That's how Canadians eat British food. And I'm just going to go ahead and throw some peas on there while I'm at it. Why not? Why not. Alright, time for your first bite. See if you can get it into the middle inner layer there. Inner layer? The filing? Yeah. Exactly. Okay, this probably would have been a lot messier if we just ate it at the pub. Mmmm. Wow. That is good stuff. What do we have in here? Okay, so this is steak. I don't think this one has veggies actually. So I think we maybe just got a standard meat pie because there are no veggies in the filling that I've come across so far. Well, the peas we threw in. Well, yeah, that makes it kind of healthy right? Um, it is really nice with the gravy because our, I guess the pastry was a little crispy, so that makes it a little soggier and easier to get at. Um, so yeah, I'm really enjoying this. It's pretty good. Enjoying it? Okay, so do you think that you can taste the ale in your meat and ale pie? Yeah, a little bit but it is not overwhelming that is for sure. You mostly taste the gravy and the sauce that comes with it. And it comes with chips. Chips. What pub food would be complete without chips. Just as we finish our meal the sun emerges. Yeah, exactly. So the price point for this, we picked this up at a pub for about seven pounds, we've also visited a few other pubs where we've noticed it is more expensive there. So I'm not sure what a typical price is. This, I think, was a decent deal. And very tasty. Very tasty. Alright, so good morning from London. We are up bright and early to do some sightseeing around town. But first up we need our energy so we've stopped at a pub for a full English breakfast. Ooh, look at that. So what exactly is in a full English breakfast? Alright, so before we tuck into this breakfast let's take a look at what we've got. So we have toast over here. We've got sausage. We've got baked beans, egg, tomato, hash browns and bacon. So that is going to be a lot of calories. That seems quite complete. Yes. So we've got here is fairly complete but it does vary by region and sometimes you can get it with black pudding. I'm kind of glad this one doesn't have it because I'm not a fan. I'd try it. Alright, I'm loading up a little bit of everything on here. So I've got my beans, my hash browns and the sausage. You know what? It's very greasy, very hearty, it is almost like having lunch for breakfast but it tastes really good. I'm really hungry right now so I'm just going to keep working at it. Time for my first bite. Oh man, that sausage is tasty. It actually reminds me of a Canadian breakfast that I'd sometimes order at a restaurant which includes a lot of these items but also sometimes it comes with waffles or pancakes. So this is a huge hearty breakfast. More like a brunch than just a standalone breakfast. And we can't forget Canadian maple syrup. Yeah. So what is the price point for this delicious full English breakfast? So basically you're looking at paying roughly around just under 4 pounds for the breakfast. And we paid one pound for unlimited coffee and tea which was awesome because we're going to take advantage of that for sure. Well, when in England just about anywhere. We're having breakfast right at a pub right now but you can also get a full English breakfast at a hotel or at a restaurant. So you'll have no trouble finding one if you really want to try it. Yeah, and it is really well advertised. Mmm hmmm. Alright, so this morning we are off to a festival. It is called Blogstock. And as you can guess from the name it is a blogging festival. So we're just heading over there. It is taking place in a park just north of London. And yeah, the weather isn't really cooperating but hopefully it'll get sunnier later on in the day. Alright, so we've arrived at Blog Stock. I've had my hot cacao so I'm all warmed up. And now we're going to give you a little tour of the place. What are your sort of like top tips for a startup Youtuber? Okay, my top tip would probably have to do with SEO. I see a lot of people who don't write a proper title for their video. They don't include any tags. They don't have a description. And you have don't have the audience on your channel yet and you want people to start finding you your video needs to rank when they're searching for the best beaches in Thailand. Or you know, the best restaurants in New York City. So do really good SEO on your videos so that you'll show up in the searches, people will find your channel and maybe if they like what they see they'll end up subscribing. So good SEO can help grow your audience. Even though SEO is kind of boring and some don't want to learn about it. Your favorite thing about Blogstock? If I had to narrow it down to just one favorite thing it was networking with other bloggers and brands in the same industry as us. There is so many creative people doing amazing things. It is great to get to know them as individuals and to see what they're doing in terms of projects. And what was your most memorable experience from blogstock? I think getting to talk about YouTube and video just because it is something I really enjoy and I wish more people would try making YouTube videos. So that was a lot of fun. So tell us your name, your blog and what was your favorite thing about blog stock? My name is Elizebeth. My blog is Rosalilium and Awesomewave. There is two blogs. And my favorite thing about blogstock was meeting so many people in real life that I speak to on twitter everyday. I'm Raj. I'm from Awesome Wave. My favorite thing about Blogstock this year has been finally meeting people that I've only known through my computer screen, getting to see them. Everyone else has probably said the same thing but it is true. Getting to the festival, getting to events and seeing people face to face. Meeting them, getting their humor and what they're about is definitely what something like this is for. My name is Macca Sherifi. I am the Brit from a Brit and a Broad. I think one of the most important things I've learned from blogstock is the importance of accounting. I think most of us are in this industry that we kind of like make a bit of money on the side and we just think we can brush it under the carpet and not worry about it. When at the end of the day we're trying to be professionals. And being professional means that we have to earn an income and doing that you have to pay the taxman. Unfortunately, but we do. So I think it is very important that we have to think about you know getting a good accountant on board and making sure we you know do the right thing. So my name is Brenna Holeman and I'm from This Battered Suitcase dot com and I have to say I've had the pleasure of hearing Audrey and Samuel speak twice today. And I have to say that I learned the most from them about vlogging and it really inspired me to get into vlogging and get on YouTube because I don't use that. And it was so great to hear about their experiences doing it. So that is what I learned the most from Blogstock today. Paul, so tell us why should people come to blogstock? If you're a blogger you should come to blogstock because there is lots of different sessions from different niches where you can learn all about blogging obviously. Instagram, photography. You can learn about how to make money from your blog. How to be more professional. How to pitch. All sorts of different sessions. We also have lots of varied sessions so some stuff is more inspirational as well. Like how to conquer your fears and live life to the full. That kind of stuff. And we have some great food.

This week we are exploring the Polish capital. We've already been here a few days and it has been amazing. It has been such a pleasant surprise and unlike any part of Europe we've traveled in so far. So yeah, this week we're going to be highlighting 25 things to do around the city and we're excited to show you what it is all about. This was our first trip to Poland and we dove into the capital headfirst. While our travels may have started in the charming Old Town, it wasn't long before we discovered that Warsaw has a cool artsy side. We visited bright neon museums in the art district, shopped in boutiques selling soviet-chic apparel, and got to experience the capital's legendary nightlife. It many ways it was a whirlwind visit, but it was also a fun introduction that made us curious to discover more of Poland in our future travels. The following video will highlight 25 things to do in Warsaw and give you a glimpse into this up and coming capital. Right now we're visiting Castle Square - a very popular area for both tourists and locals alike. Last night we visited and it was absolutely packed. And this morning there is not as many people so it is really cool to get the two different contrasts. Walking around the Old Town is a fascinating experience because almost all of what you see is new even if it looks authentic. Most of the city was razed to the ground after the Second World War, and that makes for a rather surreal visit. So up next we're about to enter Warszawa's Royal Castle which used to be home to the Polish Monarchy. Of course Poland hasn't had a monarchy for a really long time but this still remains a historical building. So we're going to go in and take a look. So it is our first full day here in Poland. This week we are visiting Warsaw and that means we have to try some traditional Polish food. Today we are going for the National Dish. We're going to be eating Pierogies for lunch. So we've placed our order and now we're waiting for it to arrive. So if you've never tried Perogies before, they're a stuffed dumpling, typically they are steamed and then they're fried. And they come in a variety of different flavors. We've ordered meat and cheese ones but you can also get dessert pierogi as well. When we first ordered our pierogi we were surprised that restaurants only served 5 or 6 a plate - it seemed like a small meal at first glance, but we soon learned that looks can be deceiving and that pierogi are incredibly filling! The Neon Museum is located in Soho Factory Praga and it is the place to learn about Cold War Neon. It's definitely one of the most interesting museums we've ever set foot in. During our trip we joined Adventure Warsaw for a historical tour of the city. Our ride was a bubblegum pink Nysa van from the Soviet days and together with our guide we cruised the city in style while uncovering a bit of the past and learning how it has shaped the present day city. Milk bars are a bit of misnomer because you donâ€™t go there to drink milk, nor do you go there to drink alcohol. You can however try dairy based Polish dishes in a cafeteria-like setting, including pink beetroot soup. So today seems like a great day to be out on the water. The sun is out, the weather is great so we're going to take a little boat cruise down the Vistula River. The water levels were particularly low when we visited during the summer months, so our leisurely boat ride required a little bit of punting. The boat trip was a fun way to see Warsaw's riverside beaches and gaze at the Old Town off in the distance. Alright, so the sun is going down and that means we are going to go out and experience Warsaw's nightlife. We've actually signed up to do a pub crawl. So we'll see how that goes. We've had our nap. We have energy. Let's go check it out. I'm the new guy. We fired you. Woo! Pub crawl! So if there is one building that dominates the skyline here in Warszawa it is the Palace of Culture and Science. Which you can see right here behind me. This was built in the 1950's and it was a gift from the Soviet Union. And we're going to go inside because apparently on the 30th floor there is an observation deck and you get some great views of the city. The sentiment towards the Palace of Culture and Science is very mixed. There are those who see beauty in this historical landmark and others who despise the Soviet regime that it once stood for. If you are interested in visiting this structure, there are tours that take you behind closed doors, before going up to observation deck for views of the city below. The Chopin Museum is another museum to consider visiting. It holds an extensive collection of manuscripts, letters and paintings that document the composer's life. When we weren't sampling Polish food in restaurants, we were learning to make Pierogi by hand. We ended up taking a cooking class with 'Polish Your Cooking' where we learned to make pierogi with various fillings including: ground beef and onions, cheese and potatoes, and strawberries for dessert. It took us about 3 hours to prepare all the food and then we devoured it in a matter of minutes. Å�azienki Park is the largest park in Warsaw and the name means â€˜Bathsâ€™ thanks to the bathing pavilion that was located on these very grounds. The park is also part of the Royal Route, which was a communication route that ran southward from the Old Town back in the days when snail mail was the only way to get urgent messages across. The museum sits on the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto and it documents the history of Polish Jews in a chronological timeline. The exhibit starts out with the traveling merchants that came to Poland during the medieval period and it spans several hundred years through to the Holocaust and the Post War Years. So it is lunchtime over here and we are in Warsaw's Old Town. Today we are going to be sampling something called Bigos. Which is a traditional Polish dish. And it consists of different meats and cabbage. So we've just ordered our food and now we're waiting for it to get here. Alright, so my lunch has arrived. Low and behold here is my bigos. And this may look like a small portion but that is just because I ordered it as an appetizer. And you can normally get it in a bread bowl or you can get it with a side of potatoes. I got some sliced bread here in the basket so I'm going to be trying that. And also I've learned that no two Bigos recipes are the same. It is basically just a mix of different cuts of meat. And you can have beef, veal, pork, venison, rabbit. Whatever you want to throw in there it works. This is the type of dish you'd eat during the winter months, but if you look hard enough you'll be able to find it on some restaurant menus year round. Another cool museum to visit is the Life Under Communism Museum. It may be small, but the way it's been set up will make you feel like you've travelled back through time. Not only will you visit rooms styled the way the average home would have looked during Soviet period, but they also have posters, board games, music, and fashion from the same era. For a look at a very unique garden, you can swing by the rooftop gardens at the Warsawâ€™s University Library. It's a beautiful place and we noticed more than one student napping there. So right now we are standing in front of St. Anne's Church which is located here in the historic centre of Warsaw. And it looks like a pretty happening place. We were here earlier in the morning when they were having mass. Now we're seeing a whole bunch of people in really fancy outfits so it looks like there maybe a wedding taking place. And they also hold concerts during the noon hour. The Barbican is a red-brick fortification that once encircled Warsaw. These days the city has expanded well beyond the fortification's limits, but it still remains one of the city's top attractions. You'll find lots of artists and buskers along the main gates, and you can also enjoy some scenic views of the city by walking along the length of the wall. Just a short walk from Castle Square you'll find the Presidential Palace, which we couldn't go into but looked pretty nice from the outside. Alright, so it is time for dessert. And next up we've ordered some Rurki which apparently is a Torpedo dessert. And now when I was reading about these online it said that it is supposed to be a buttery flaky pastry that is filled with cream. But as you can see this is more like a wafer. It looks a bit harder to me. So yeah, we're going to try it. I'm going to try it. It's crumbling. Oh yeah. It's almost like an ice cream cone that has been filled with cream. And also the cream isn't sweet. Um, they either forgot to add sugar or they just like their cream very natural. So it is a whipped cream but not sweet at all. It must be healthy for you. Healthy dessert. Woah! The Warsaw Uprising Museum is dedicated to the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 led by the Polish resistance army. The museum chronicles the 63 days of the uprising as Poles fought against Germans. The Copernicus Science Centre is an interactive learning centre where you can discover science through experiments. While we were probably a little too old for the exhibits, we can see how this would be a fun place for children. If you're in town during the summer months and over the weekend, I would also suggest checking out the Old Town at night. There is live music, people are out enjoying a cool evening stroll, and the restaurants are packed. It's a really fun atmosphere. For the football lovers, there's the option of catching a match at the National Stadium. Or perhaps a concert if it's not football season. Well, well what do you have there? So we're at the airport but we couldn't leave without having this one last Polish sweet treat. This is PÄ…czki and it is basically like a donut but it apparently has some kind of jam inside. This is my first time to try it so I'm quite excited. Oh yeah, that is sweet. It is actually seeping out onto my finger here. What kind of filing do you think that is? Kind of like a maybe a strawberry type of jam sort of. It tastes like that. That looks good and it is covered in icing with little almonds on top. That looks delicious. We came to Warsaw with little to no expectations and the city completely surprised us. Our week in the capital was spent sampling Polish cuisine, learning about the city's past through museums and historical tours, and also dabbling in a bit of the nightlife. Warsaw is quickly rising through the ranks and we think it won't be long before travellers are flocking en masse. So if you're planning a trip to Poland, don't skip over the capital because there is more to Warsaw than meets the eye. So it is our first full day here in Poland and this week we're visiting Warsaw and that means we have to try some traditional Polish foods. Today we are going for the National dish. We're going to be eating Pierogi for lunch. So we've placed our order and now we're waiting for it to arrive. So if you've never tried Perogies before they're a stuffed dumpling. Typically they're steamed and then they're fried. And they come in a variety of different flavors. We've ordered meat and cheese ones but you can also get dessert pierogi as well. Oh la la. Look what has arrived! I know, my lunch is finally here so I'm going to be having the cheese pierogi and they also come with bacon so this looks pretty good to me. Let's get a shot of that bacon. I'm pretty hungry and here is the bacon. Oh la la. Let's take a bite. Mmm. That is delicious. Wow. I'm trying to figure out what kind of cheese it is. Ricotta maybe? I was just going to say ricotta. It is a softer cheese and there is a car making noise behind us. Whatevs! That is how it goes. Yeah, so it is really good. Actually we tried Pierogies last night for dinner but we didn't film it and it was slightly different. Those had been boiled and pan-fried but the perogies we're having today are simply boiled. So a little bit different and also last night's pierogies were served with sour cream and pickles. And these just came with bacon. So I guess there is a few different variations around the city. Okay, so tell us about your perogies. Which are you having? I'm having the meat ones. And take a look at this. They are absolutely stuffed with meat. When I've had pierogie in Canada, which you can also pickup they're mostly heavy on the outer layer and there is not a lot of filing inside. But this is the exact opposite. These are absolutely stuffed. I can't wait to try them. Let's take the first bite here. Like this is just the perfect comfort food. Like it is really hot and it is the summer right now but this is the kind of food that would be amazing to have in the winter. So like Sam was saying this is quite a hearty and heavy meal. And that is because originally this was meant to be peasant food. So you wanted something that was going to fill you up and hold you throughout the day as you toiled away on the fields. So yeah, I mean it looks like a small portion when the plate first came. We only saw five dumplings and it is like 'well' maybe I'll be hungry after this. But once you start eating it fills you up right away. We were so full last night from our first pierogi meal. Okay, so you seem quite impressed by these Polish perogies. So tell us what sets them apart from the Canadian ones? You better believe it. What sets them apart is that they are handmade and that they are so stuffed with filing inside. I'm used to having kind of the crappy frozen ones that you buy in Canada and these are like 100 times better. So if you're looking to order pierogi you can usually get these at a pub or a restaurant. It is the type of item that shows up on almost every single menu. And in terms of price point we paid about ten Euros and that included two plates of perogies and Sam's beer. And I had two of them and you also had a water as well. Yep, so pretty good deal if you ask me. So it is lunchtime over here and we are in Warsaw's old town. Today we are going to be sampling something called Bigos which is a traditional Polish dish. And it consists of different meats and cabbage. So we've just ordered our food and now we're waiting for it to get here. So tell us the tail of how we learned about Bigos. While we were traveling on the train from Berlin to Warszawa were met this Polish guy who spent a lot of time in the US. And basically he was raving about this Bigos. This Hunter's stew. So this is the reason why we're trying. A recommendation from a local basically. Alright, so my lunch has arrived. Low and behold here is my Bigos. And this may look like a small portion but that is just because I ordered it as an appetizer. And you can normally get it in a bread bowl or you can get it with a side of potatoes. I got some sliced bread here in the basket so I'm going to be trying that. And also, I've learned that no two Bigos recipes are the same. It is basically just a mix of different cuts of meat. You can have beef, veal, pork, venison, rabbit. Whatever you want to throw in there it works. So I've got a nice fork full of cabbage and some kind of meat. Let's see if I can decipher what it is. Okay. That is really good. The cabbage it almost tastes a little bit fermented but it is not as strong as sauerkraut. And the meat, I think it might be beef. It's a familiar flavor. So time for your first fork full. Yeah! Yeah, you're right. That is really good. I like that is has a bit of sour taste. That is really appealing for me. And what is cool about Bigos is that it literally means big mess, big confusion and so if you look down here that is exactly what it looks like. It just looks like a hodgepodge of all different kinds of things. Vegetables, meats, cabbage. And that is exactly what Bigos is. Okay, so apparently Bigos is the kind of dish that you can refrigerate. And then reheat and that is meant to make the flavors a lot stronger. And it is also the kind of dish that keeps on giving. So that means if you start running low you can just add some cabbage, add some meat and make it last for a week. Alrighty, so that was delicious. What is the price point for the Hunter's Stew? So if you want to pickup the Hunter's Stew while you're in Poland you can expect to pay the equivalent of five to seven Euros. And definitely we recommend it. It's delicious and it is very hearty and just an awesome meal. Alright, so it is time for dessert and next up we've ordered some Rurki. Which apparently is a torpedo dessert. And now when I was reading about these online it said that it is supposed to be a buttery flaky pastry that is filled with cream but as you can see this is more like a wafer. It looks a bit harder to me. So yeah, we're going to try it. I'm going to try it. It is crumbly. Oh yeah. It is almost like an ice cream cone that has been filled with cream. And also the cream isn't sweet. They either forgot to add sugar or they just like there cream very natural. So it is a whipped cream but not sweet at all. It must be healthy for you. Healthy dessert. Woah! So apparently the Rurki originated from Turkey and Bulgaria but this is obviously the Polish kind. And I think what makes it different is that the outer layer is more like a crispy wafer. It is kind of like a wafer cookie. So my turn to try it. Yeah, it is pretty good. You're right, the cream isn't overly sweet but it is very thick. And you can tell that it is a good quality. So not our most super informative video but that is all I know about the Rurki. It is a really nice treat, fun street food snack that you can just pickup in the center of town and in terms of price point we paid the equivalent of a Euro for these two little rolls. So pretty affordable and pretty tasty.",False,"20160415 - Visit WARSAW City Guide ∩╜£ What to SEE, DO & EAT in Warsaw, Poland.en.srt"

This week we are in the Spanish capital and we are going to show you twenty five of the best things to do in the city. We were beyond excited to come and visit Madrid, after all this is a city renowned for its arts, cuisine, and nightlife. With 10 days to spare, we decided to hit up some of the best sights and attractions and film a guide highlighting ""25 things to do in Madrid"". In this video you can expect everything from lively markets and world renowned museums, to beautiful gardens and Spanish dishes. Now let's find out what the Spanish capital is all about! So this morning we are visiting Real JardÃ­n BotÃ¡nico which are the Royal Botanical Gardens here in Madrid. And it is a beautiful space, shaded, lots of different plants from around the world. And the place is actually massive so I'm going to show you the map so you can get an idea of how many little gardens you can visit. And we've only covered a fraction of it so far. Yep. Palacio Real de Madrid is one of the largest palaces in all of Europe. Technically, this is the official residence of the Spanish Royal Family, however, they choose to live in a smaller and more modest palace in the outskirts of town. The Royal Palace is open to visitors year round. So another thing you can do at the palace here is check out the changing of the guard. We were here at eleven o'clock and that is when it started. So one thing that we keep noticing about our stay here in Madrid is that they love their gardens and their parks. Right now we are visiting a place called Jardines de Sabatini and again it is just a garden that is located behind the Royal Palace. And it is a beautiful place to visit and there is hardly any tourists here. So I recommend you come check it out. So right now we're riding the cable car over Madrid. It is an eleven minute journey. Two and a half kilometers. And I think we're going to get some great views of the city. La Rosaleda is a massive rose garden located in the west end of the city. Every year during the month of May a contest is held to select the most beautiful rose of them all. We missed the contest by a couple of months, but we still enjoyed wandering through the grounds. Meals were a big highlight during our visit to Madrid, especially gazpacho! Okay, so time for the first spoonful of Gazpacho. Oh ho ho baby. Mmmm. That is so good. It is tangy because of the tomato. It is served cold so it is really refreshing. And this one has a lot more ingredients than salmorejo. So I just put in some chopped bell peppers, green and red peppers. It has also got a bit of onions in there. And it was drizzled with olive oil on top. So it is a great combination on a hot summer day. I'm just going to keep enjoying this over here. It is so good. The Prado museum holds one of the best collections of Spanish art. They have works by artists like Francisco de Goya, Diego VelÃ¡zquez, and El Greco. Admission to the museum is free in the evenings 2 hours before closing, but you'll need few days to cover everything this museum has to offer. So at the moment we're visiting Parque del Buen Retiro which is one of the biggest parks in the city. And we're just taking a little break in the shade because summer in Madrid feels like someone has turned on the blow-dryer and they're just blowing it all over your body. It is like a wall of hot air hitting you in the face. So, we rest and cool down people. Parque del Buen Retiro is a massive park in Madrid. It has beautiful boulevards for strolling, a large pond where you can rent row boats, and plazas with trees that will make you feel like you've stumbled into Alice in Wonderland. One attraction you shouldn't miss when visiting Parque del Retiro is the Crystal Palace. It's a beautiful building that streams in natural sunlight, and on occasion they host contemporary art exhibitions. Palacio de VelÃ¡zquez is also located in the same park. It has red-brick-and-tile architecture, and inside you'll fine temporary exhibitions organized through the Reina SofÃ­a museum. So if you're in Madrid during the summer months you can check out this book fair which is located just behind the Botanical Gardens. Cuesta de Moyano is a little hill lined with book stands and you can pick up literature ranging from philosophy to fantasy, all for a couple of Euros. We couldn't come to the capital and not try Spain's national dish: paella. Okay so your mixed Paella has arrived. Tell us about it. Yeah, the paella is finally here. So the mixed paella has a whole bunch of different things. Let's take a look down at it. So you can see that there is chicken, we've got shrimp, we've got other kinds of seafood, we've got peas. Let's take the first bite here. This is my favorite Spanish food. The thing I like about it so much is that you have all of these different ingredients and it just has such a flavorful sauce on top of the rice. It is just so good. Well, we certainly polished that off. So now let's talk about the price. Yeah, that was nice and filling. So in terms of price it can vary widely. In more expensive, kind of like gourmet restaurants that really specialize in it, we've seen it go up to thirty or thirty five Euros. We've never actually ate somewhere like that. The place we went to was eleven Euros and we thought it was a really good value. We're both really full now. And I've also seen it as an appetizer in some smaller types of restaurants. And you can expect to maybe pay seven or eight Euros for that. So next up we've going to visit the Temple of Debod. Which is an ancient Egyptian Temple that is here in Madrid. And now it wasn't stolen by the Spaniards. It was actually given as a gift because they were building a dam in Egypt in the same area where the temple used to be located. And it was at risk of flooding. So it was given as a gift in order to preserve it. And it is actually a really popular place to watch the sunset and there is lots of people hanging out here so we're going to show you a bit of that. Here we are visiting the home of Real Madrid football club. Easily one of the most famous teams in the world, not just in Spain. And we're going to take a little walk around outside. And you have a new hat to represent. I just did buy one of these. Santiago BernabÃ©u Stadium is home to the Real Madrid Futbol Club. This is one of the most popular football teams in the world with a huge fan base. So another thing to do in Madrid is actually go out and experience the nightlife. So tonight we're out having a nice little drink. I've got Tinto de Verano. Sam's got Sangria and I do have to warn you the nightlife in Madrid does get started pretty late. We're out right now at like nine thirty and that is super early. Normally people get together past midnight and things keeps going until like four or five in the morning. So, you've been warned. So what have been your first impressions of Madrid's night life? Pulsating, in a word. Hahaha. Recently, we were out with friends and we didn't get back home until about four thirty or five in the morning. Definitely a night to remember. The San Miguel Market is the place to come if you want to sample a wide array of Spanish dishes all under one roof. You'll find everything ranging from seafood to meats and sausages, as well as glasses of sangria and tinto de verano. Plaza Mayor is Madrid's central square and it is lined with little cafes and restaurants. It's a nice place to enjoy a cup of coffee and do a bit of people watching, but you will pay a lot more than you would elsewhere in the city. So it is breakfast time here in Madrid. We've just rolled out of bed at 10 am which is a bit unusual. But we're here at a local cafe and we're going to have a traditional Spanish breakfast. So we have ordered a hot chocolate with churros and porras. So we're going to show you what those are like in just a few minutes. And what are you having? I'm actually having the proper churros. Which is a deep-fried dough. And what I've found interesting is when I've had this in Canada it is more of a dessert but over here in Spain it is a breakfast. And it is a very popular breakfast item. So let's dip that right into the chocolate. Show us how it is done. Break off a piece here. And that hot chocolate is as thick as it gets. It must have some kind of special ingredients that make it especially thick and rich. It is like mud. It is like chocolate sludge. Wow. Let me just say, I could get very used to having this as my normal breakfast. It is that good. So what I find unique about the Spanish churro is the shape. When we had these in South America they were usually like long little strips. And also there is no filling in these. I still haven't come across any Spanish churros that have filings. Whereas in South America they were stuffed with chocolate, vanilla pudding, dulce de leche. So that is another difference. Now let's dip this. Oh la la. This is so good. It is like a wishbone. Puerta del Sol means Gate of the Sun and it is one of the busiest spots in Madrid. It's a great spot to do a bit of shopping, catch a street performance, and then grab a quick bite. La Almudena is a catholic church which sits directly across from the Royal Palace. The church is open to visitors free of charge, but a small donation is suggested to upkeep the building. Right now we're visiting the Oriental Plaza, which is right by the palace. It is a nice kind of scenic area to walk. And you can see all kinds of plants from Asia. So it is time for another breakfast here in Madrid. Today we are having the madrileÃ±o which is the local breakfast that everybody likes to eat in the city. And if you look down here you'll be able to see this is Tortilla. Which is a potato and egg type of dish. So it is kind of like a potato and egg omelette. And it is delicious. It comes with a side of bread. And I can't wait to dig in. Oh la la. It is so good. So good. This is your favorite breakfast. It really is. I've been eating it daily. And on my birthday I had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. That is how much I like it. The Queen Sofia museum focuses on 20th-century art. It forms part of the Golden Triangle of Art, which also includes the Prado and the Thyssen. You can also visit Thyssen-Bornemisza, an art museum in the city that was once the second largest private collection in the world. Final thoughts on your time in Madrid. Well, I really enjoyed the city. And I really found that it is super walk-able. We were here for 10 days and we hardly had to take the metro at all. We just took the bus once when we were visiting the stadium but the rest of the time we were able to walk wherever we needed to go. And also I think it is a great city for art lovers. There are so many galleries and museums to check out. And a lot of them are free in the evening. So keep that in mind. And now it is your turn. What did you think of Madrid? You know what? I absolutely loved Madrid. It is a city that just really clicked with me. We have a lot of friends that are living here long term and prior to coming here I had no idea like why would someone want to come to Madrid? Now I totally get it. I love the culture, I love the food, I love the nightlife. Everything is really cheap. I go to the grocery store and I can get a one liter thing of wine for just over a Euro. It is just a really affordable fun city to be in. And it is somewhere I hope I have a chance to come back to again soon. And that is a wrap of our time in Madrid! We had a splendid time and were truly sad to say goodbye to the city, but that just means we'll have to come back again. If you have any travel tips for Madrid, feel free to share those in the comments below. And once again, for more city guides and travel videos, be sure to subscribe to our channel! Welcome to the extended portion of this video where you'll find a series of travel and food vlogs focused in and around Madrid. First we'll take you on a day-trip tour of Toledo before we sample some delicious Spanish cuisine including Gazpacho, Paella, Churros and Tortilla. Well Hello, So today is July 23rd. Which means it is my birthday! So Sam and I are going to take a little day trip. We've been staying in Madrid but Toledo is only thirty minutes away by train. So we're going to head out and have some birthday adventures in a new city. We've arrived and it is a beautiful train station. Time to get the birthday girl some lunch. Yes. So we decided to walk into the city which was maybe a mistake considering it is almost forty degrees out. We should have just grabbed a taxi but at least they have these escalators that help you reach the summit of the center of the old town I guess. So yeah, it is nice being in the shade and not having to climb stairs. It is kind of funny because just outside of the escalators are these old ruins. So you have something very modern and then you have the ruins right beside it. Yeah, quite the contrast. So we made it to the top. And this is our reward. Check out these views. Birthday girl, what is your starter? Alright, so we found a nice little restaurant and I've ordered Gazpacho which is a cold tomato soup with onions, peppers and cucumbers. But you can't see any of that because it looks like they've just liquefied it and turned it into a bit of a cream. But let's try it. Mmmmm. Refreshing? That is so refreshing on a day like today. And it is a little bit tart and tangy which I really like. I could drink this out of a glass it is so good. And what is your entree? I'm trying something I've never tried before. It is called Migas de Pastor. And if you look down here it has got meat, it has got some kind of breadcrumbs here and it also has veggies. I think these maybe peppers. Let's take a bite with the meat and the breadcrumbs. How is it? It's really good. I think that is a piece of like chorizo meat. Nice! Spicy! And what does the birthday gal have? So I'm having a type of Tortilla which is basically potatoes and egg. Kind of like an omelette style meal. This also has ham in it. And I've got some pork right underneath. They've soaked it in ketchup which I'm not a huge fan of. But it is alright. I actually had this for breakfast today and that was a little bit better. So I see your main dish has arrived. You know what, this is actually my favorite Spanish dish that I've tried since I've been to Spain. It is called Paella. Take a look down here. We're going to be doing a bit more of a dedicated video to this soon but for now you can basically know that it is a mixed type of rice with seafood and vegetables. Alright, let's take a bite of that. So good. It's got a really rich and kind of creamy sauce. I just absolutely love this. And over here in Spain wine is like water. I had a choice between water and wine so I got my own bottle. I think I made the right decision. Aren't you glad we got about a thirty minute break in between our main course and dessert? What do you have? I am having flan. And I don't really know how to describe this dessert except to say that it is popular in South America and in Spain. And your Mom makes a really good flan. Yes, and the brown stuff you see it is kind of like caramelized sugar but I really can't explain the dessert itself because I have no idea what it is made with even though I've eaten it my whole life. That's good. Alright, and I have one of my all-time favorites. Arroz con leche. This is a rice pudding and unlike you I can explain what is in it. There is milk, there is rice and there is cinnamon. And you know who makes a good rice pudding - my Mom too. Let's take a bite. I'll stir that cinnamon around a bit. It's really good. It is really creamy. I can tell they've used like maybe even a cream instead of a milk. Nice. And lots of sugar and cinnamon. So is it served hot or cold here? Ah, cold. Nice. So we are now visiting the AlcÃ¡zar, which is the one building that dominates the city skyline. And they also have a really cool military museum. And normally I wouldn't be into that but because it is so hot outside it has actually been really nice being indoors with AC. Just learning a bit of the history by force. I'm beginning to realize that Spain is more of a winter destination. All we've been doing since we've come here is sweating like pigs. So we are hiding indoors again. We found a little corner store with lots of fans and Popsicles. So trying to cool down here people. So I think that is about all we can handle for today. So cooling off yet again with ice cream cones this time. And now we're going to head back to the train station and try to get back to Madrid a little bit earlier than planned. So it is three thirty PM in Madrid, which means it is lunch time. So we're outside at a little patio right across from our hotel. And we're going to be doing a battle of the soups. We plan on trying two different soups that are from the region of CÃ³rdoba, Andalusia in southern Spain. And they are called Gazpacho and Salmorejo. And there is some similarities and some differences between these two cold soups, so we're going to be showing you what those are. So our two soups have arrived. I'm having Gazpacho, Sam is having Salmorejo. And at first glance they do look quite similar. The same color because it is a tomato base but the topping is a little bit different. Now we're going to be actually tasting them and telling you about the ingedients and what sets these two apart. Okay, so time for the first spoonful of Gazpacho. Oh ho ho, baby! Mmmm. That is so good. It is tangy because of the tomato. It is served cold so it is really refreshing. And this one has a lot more ingredients than Salmorejo. So I just put in some chopped bell peppers, green and red peppers. It has also got a bit of onions in there. And it was drizzled with olive oil on top. So a great combination on a hot summer day. I'm just going to keep enjoying this over here. It is so good. So two more things I'll mention about Gazpacho. If you don't want like a full bowl of soup you can actually get it as a drink in a glass and that is cheaper because it is a smaller portion. And also Spanish Gazpacho is really different from Moroccan Gazpacho, which is what I was used to. The Moroccan recipe has chickpeas and beans so don't be surprised if you come to Spain and there are no chickpeas in your Gazpacho. And Gazpacho also comes with a basket of bread on the side. So if you don't want to drink it like a soup you can just dip some bread in there. And almost treat it like a dip. Great either way. And you are having Salmorejo. Tell us what that is like? And that is a little bit different than the Gazpacho. If you look down here you can see that it is a thicker tomato puree. So basically it is thicker. And you'll also notice that there is some egg here. So I'm going to have the first bite to see what it tastes like. You have some egg, ham and olive oil as your toppings. Yeah, it is almost a bit more like a cold stew than a soup. It is definitely thicker. I really like the taste. I like the olive oil drizzled on top too. It just. It is a really awesome dish to have in the summer to cool down. And apparently there is a mystery ingredient here. What is it? Yeah, there is something cool that we discovered upon research. And that is that stale bread is in both of these. In both of these soups. So they soak it in water and then just mix it in with the Gazpacho and the Salmorejo. But you wouldn't be able to tell at first glance. No, you wouldn't. And price point for this meal. So as an appetizer here in Madrid you can pick one up for about five Euros. Or if you want the smaller portion you can get it in a glass for about two to three Euros. Two fifty usually. So it is dinner time in Madrid and today we are here at a local restaurant where we're going to be trying two different dishes. We are planning to eat Paella and something called FideuÃ. They are two dishes from the region of Valencia. And there are some similarities and some differences between the two so we'll be showing you those as soon as the plates arrive. The food has arrived. Yes, some I'm going introduce mine first. I am having the Fideua, which is kind of like a noodle Paella, and it is made with Vermicelli noodles which are super thin and mine has mussels, prawns and squid as well as artichoke hearts so let's take a big bite of this. It's hot. That is really nice. Wow. You can really taste the seafood. It is super flavorful. And I also like that the noodles are a little bit overcooked. Like they are nice and soggy, which is how I like them. So I'm quite happy with my meal so far. Okay, so your mixed Paella has arrived. Tell us about it. Yeah, the Paella is finally here. So the mixed Paella has a whole bunch of different things. Let's take a look down at it. So you can see that there is chicken, we've got shrimp, we've got other kinds of seafood, we've got peas and it has got kind of a looks like to be a yellow type of curry sauce. Nice. So let's take the first bite here. This is my favorite Spanish food. The thing I like about it so much is that you have all of these different ingredients and it just has such a flavorful sauce on top of the rice. It is just so good. So if Sam were to try the traditional Paella from Valencia that one would actually have chicken and rabbit because that is what the original recipe calls for. But we're not really used to eating rabbit so that is why we went with the mixed one that has chicken, some seafood and chorizo. So quite a few restaurants in Madrid, and all throughout Spain have Paella on the menu, but the ones that really specialize in it have a special kind of pan. Some come take a look here. And you can see that it is made right in it and brought to your table. And they have the wooden guards on the end that basically probably protect you from getting burnt. Exactly. Well, we certainly polished that off. So now let's talk about the price. Yeah, that was nice and filling. So in terms of price it can vary widely. In more expensive kind of like gourmet restaurants that really specialize in it we've seen it go up to thirty or thirty five Euros. We've never actually ate somewhere like that. The place we went to was eleven Euros. And we thought it was a really good value. We're both really full now. And I've also seen it as an appetizer in some smaller types of restaurants and you can expect maybe to pay seven or eight Euros for that. So it is breakfast time here in Madrid. We've just rolled out of bed at 10 am. Which is a bit unusual. But we're here at a local cafe and we're going to have a traditional Spanish breakfast. So we have ordered a hot chocolate with Churros and Porras. So we're going to show you what those are like in just a few minutes. So this is something that is completely new for me. This is called Porras. And it is basically like a giant sized Churro. Like I've never seen anything like this before. I know, look at that, it's like. It's wider than your shoulders. Hahaha! Alright, so we're going to dip it in the hot chocolate because that is how things are done here. Oh ho ho baby. Mmmmm. That is delicious. It is nice and greasy. And sweet. It is probably not the healthiest way to start the day but 'hey' when in Spain. Hey we're doing it the Spanish way. That is delicious. I'm loving it. What are you having? I'm actually having the proper Churros. This is a deep-fried dough. And what I've found interesting is that when I've had this in Canada it is more of a dessert but over here in Spain it is a breakfast. And it is very popular breakfast item. So let's dip that right in the chocolate. Show us how it is done. Break off a piece here. And that hot chocolate is as thick as it gets. It must have some kind of special ingredients that make it especially thick and rich. It's like mud. It's like chocolate sludge. Wow! Let me just say I could get very used to having this as my normal breakfast. It's that good. So what I find unique about the Spanish Churros is the shape. When we had these in South America they were usually like long little strips. And also there is no filing in these. I still haven't come across any Spanish Churros that have fillings. Whereas in South America they were stuffed with chocolate, vanilla pudding, dulce de leche. So that is another difference. Now let's dip this. Oh la la. This is so good. Mmmm. It is like a wishbone. Hahahaha. So show us what you do with the leftover hot chocolate. You know what. This is a breakfast that is like a gift that keeps on giving. What is left over is a hot chocolate and it is amazing. It is so thick. Like we were talking earlier. It is almost like a sludge but it is really rich and creamy. I think there is extra condensed milk or something. Wonderful. So this is a super affordable breakfast. I've got the menu right next to me. And basically it is two Euros and fifty cents and you get your peach juice, your hot chocolate and either three Churros or three Porras. And yeah, I'm stuffed after all that food. Surprisingly. So it is time for another breakfast here in Madrid. Today we are having the madrileÃ±o, which is the local breakfast that everybody likes in this city. And if you look down here you'll be able to see this is Tortilla. Which is a potato and egg type of dish. So it is kind of like a potato and egg omelette. And it is delicious. It comes with a side of bread. And I can't wait to dig in. Oh la la. Look at that. It's so good. It is so good. This is your favorite breakfast. It really is. I've been eating it daily. And on my birthday I had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. That is how much I like it. Okay, so apparently how this dish is made is that the potatoes are first cooked in olive oil and then the egg is added and then it is just flipped over several times until it is done. It really is just like an omelette in a lot of ways. So the Spanish Tortilla has nothing to do with the Mexican Tortilla. The Mexican one is just like one of those big round wraps that you use for Quesadillas and Burritos. But the Spanish Tortilla is completely different even though it shares the same name, so keep that in mind. And also while we're talking about the Spanish Tortilla it can be prepared a few different ways. Like the most simple one of them all is potato and egg but you can also start adding onions, peppers, ham, so you can get a little bit fancier. Okay, so what is the price for this delicious breakfast. This tasty breakfast comes in at around four Euros and usually it comes with a juice. They didn't have any today but it did come with a coffee and bread. And it is a filling breakfast. It is a great way to start our day. And it is definitely one of the things we have the most while we're here in Madrid.",False,"20160215 - Visit MADRID City Guide ∩╜£ What to SEE, DO & EAT in Madrid, Spain.en.srt"

This week we are exploring the city of love, city of lights and city of art. This video will be showing you the top 50 things to do here. Earlier this summer we spent a whole 10 days in Paris and we decided we wanted to highlight some of the best attractions and activities around the city. Over the course of our visit we came up with 50 things to do in Paris, but of course, there are plenty more things you could experience here. We hope this guide will you plan your trip to Paris, and let us know if there's anything else you would add to this list. Now let's get started! So we are now standing in front of a landmark that needs no introduction. This is one of the most recognized sites in all of Paris and all of France really. So I present to you the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Tower was designed for the the 1889 World Fair, and while people hated it at the time, we couldn't imagine Paris without it today. Champ des Mars is a large public green space right in front of the Eiffel Tower and it's where people go to get those postcard perfect shots. So today is our first day exploring Paris and we thought we'd sample a bit of the local cuisine. We came across a little stand that was selling crepes, so I ordered one with jambon au fromage. This one is ham and cheese. It looks delicious. We've been walking around for hours and I'm starving so I'm so excited to just bite in to this. Another thing you absolutely have to do while in Paris is try crÃªpes with Nutella. Notre-Dame is the most visited church in all of Paris and it's a great example of French Gothic architecture. Don't forget to set foot inside for a glimpse at the spectacular rose window. The Arc de Triomphe honours those who fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic Wars. Underneath the vault you'll find the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with an eternal flame, that commemorates the dead who were never identified during the world wars. So we are now going for a stroll down the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es, an avenue that is known for its luxury and opulence. You can buy all sorts of things here. We've seen luxury cars, luxury handbags, jewelry. And yeah, it is also a great place to people watch with lots of little cafes. So today we are having a nice little picnic in the outskirts of Paris. We just felt like we needed to get out of the city for a bit. So we went to a grocery store, we picked up a few snacks and now we're in the Bois de Boulogne and we're going to be having a nice little picnic outside and it is a great day for it. So I'm excited to dig in to all of this food. Oh la la. Oui! Bois de Boulogne is the the second-largest park in Paris. It was once part of the hunting grounds for the French monarchy, but these day's you're more likely to find people jogging, rowing, and enjoying picnics. We're on a boat, on a lake in the Bois de Boulogne and Sam is going to row me around for a whole hour. Yeah! Hmmmm. So this one is for those of you who have a major sweet tooth. When you come to Paris you have to try the Macaron. And we've picked up a cute little box from a little Patisserie. And they look so nice I almost don't even want to eat them. But we're going to be sampling them. I did read up on these and they are made with egg whites, icing sugar, regular sugar and then some almond powder. And they also use a little bit of food coloring to give them different colors. So as you can see here we've got four different variations with four different flavors. Though technically not in Paris, Versailles is a short train ride away. We ended up joining a biking tour and our first stop was the Versailles Market to pick up some picnic items. Once in Versailles, we dove into the Marie Antoinette's world with a visit to the Queen's Hamlet. So just now we are visiting the Petit Trianon and this would have been kind of like a make belief village where Marie Antoinette could escape the palace and just leave everything behind. No one actually lived in these homes but she would hire peasants to just come around and pretend like they were going about their daily routine just so she could have some company but not have people stare at her. So it is kind of like an artificial village and it is really weird but really pretty at the same time. After biking down the boulevards and picnicking along the shores of the Grand Canal, our day concluded with a visit inside the Versailles Palace. So another fun thing to do in Paris, if you're here during the summer months, is to head down to the banks of the Seine where there is lots of different dance parties taking place. As you can see behind me there is a few different circles, lots of Latin music playing and everyone is having a great time. I think it is like eleven PM and the party is still going. It is just getting started. So I'm not sure how much longer the railings can hold on but if you do happen to visit Paris with a loved one you can always lock your love. This reminds me of our time in Korea when we locked our love on top of Seoul Tower. Aw. So today we are visiting the neighborhood of Montemarche and one of the main attractions here is the church SacrÃ©-CÅ“ur. And there is the option of climbing up to the dome where you get some really great views of the city. So that is what we're doing right now. 300 steps to the top. I'm already a little out of breath and we've only just begun. Lead the way. Let's keep going. Aside from climbing the dome of Sacre Coeur, you can also visit the interior. The basilica has the unique distinction of sitting atop the highest point in the city. We're going to be having something called Croque-monsieur so I'm going to show you what that looks like in a second. So as you can see over here the Croque-monsieur looks a lot like a grilled cheese sandwich. So it is just two slices of bread, ham and cheese in the middle. You can also have BÃ©chamel sauce and then there is more cheese over top and that has been grilled and melted and it looks ooey and gooey so I'm going to let Sam take the first bite because I'm always eating the food first. You sure are. Here you go. Wow! Is that ever good. Basically my best way of explaining this is if you've ever had a grilled cheese before this is like a premier grilled cheese. It has an extra layer of cheese on top, plus you get the ham in the middle and I just love how I think they put a lot of maybe butter on the bread or on the toast. And it just gives it that greasiness that makes it so tasty. Well, well it is time for another French dessert. So today we are introducing you to the Eclair. And I have two Ã‰clairs in here that I just picked up from a little bakery shop. And it is time for the unveiling. Alright, so I went for the classic chocolate topped Eclair. So basically it is just a long doughy pastry. And the inside is supposed to be filled with cream. And it has chocolate icing on top. But let's bite in to make sure. Quality control over here. How is that? Actually, mine is not cream. It has like a creamy chocolate pudding in the middle. And chocolate icing on top. That is almost like a filled churro. And the taste? Yeah, it is delicious. It is amazing. And I mean the pastry, it is almost like a puffed pastry, it is very light. And it is hollow inside so then they just fill it. Is it overly sweet? It is not overly sweet. It is more creamy than anything. It is like pudding. That is really good. Surprisingly good. Originally built as a church, the PanthÃ©on was eventually turned into a mausoleum for Frenchmen who sacrificed their lives for their country. Right now we're visiting PÃ¨re Lachaise which is Paris's largest grave site. And it is the final resting place of some pretty famous people including Oscar Wilde and Jim Morrison. So does this place remind you of anywhere? It actually does. When I was in Buenos Aires it reminds me a lot of a place called Recoleta. And I have to say along with that this is the most impressive cemetery I've ever visited. We have now arrived at the Tuileries Garden and it is starting to get a little bit dark so it might be a little hard to appreciate but I assure you it is really pretty in the daytime. So now let's continue on towards the Louvre. The Tuileries Garden is a public garden located between the Louvre Museum and Place de la Concorde. Grab one of the free chairs around the water fountains and enjoy the views. Behind me is the Louvre, one of the most famous attractions in all of Paris. The Louvre is the most visited museum in the world. They say that if you were to admire every piece of artwork, you'd be there for months. One great way to experience Paris is by taking a boat tour. The Bateaux Mouches are open excursion boats that allow you to soak in the sights while you float down the river Seine. Alternatively, you could rent a bicycle and pedal your way across the city. Paris has the VÃ©libâ€™ which is a large-scale public bicycle sharing system. Or you can see Paris by segway. The Plant Garden is a large botanical garden in the city and within its grounds you'll also find the National Museum of Natural History. The Pompidou Centre is a multicultural complex for the arts and culture. The unique architecture is worth a visit even if you only admire it from the outside. Le Marais was once the French nobility's favorite place of residence, but we went there in search of street art - and there was lots to see! There are lots of celebrations throughout the year and we just happened to be in town for Bastille Day. Check your calendar before you visit and see if there are any special holidays coming up. So we are now visiting the Luxembourg Gardens which are probably some of my favorite gardens in the whole city. It is a great place to relax, come have a picnic, visit the palace or just enjoy the gardens. Luxembourg Palace was once a royal residence, but today it is home to the French Senate. So up next we've visiting a place that is called Les Invalides and this used to be an old hospital and retirement home for war veterans. These days it is more of a military museum that you can visit. And it also holds the remains of Napoleon Bonaparte. The Petit and Grand Palais are right across from each other. The Petit Palais houses a fine arts museum and the Grand Palais hosts numerous changing exhibitions. An alternative way to experience Paris is in a romantic car ride in a deux chevaux. Sainte-Chapelle is a medieval Gothic chapel. The lines were too long for us to go in, but it has one of the most impressive collections of stained glass in the world. If you want to see the Eiffel Tower from a different vantage point than Champ de Mars, TrocadÃ©ro is an alternative. Right now I'm visiting Parc des Princes stadium home of Paris Saint-Germain football club. And if you're a football fan this is where you want to come. The Moulin Rouge is one of the most famed cabarets in Paris and the birth place of the can can dance. You'll want to secure a ticket well in advance because this place is popular. Next up we visited the Montmartre Cemetery which is the final resting place of many famous artists who lived and worked in this area. Moulin de la Galette is a former windmill turned restaurant and it earns a spot on this list because it was painted by many artists including Renoir. Le Consulat is a little restaurant in Montmartre. It has been featured in many films and its a great place to people watch. There's also a museum in the area, the Montmartre Museum, which contains paintings, photographs, and posters that depict the history of the neighborhood. So you can't come to Paris and not try all the delicious pastries they have in store. So today I have picked myself one of these. This is called Mille-feuille. Which means thousand leaves. And that is just because you can see all the different layers of dough. They are super thin. And it looks like has some kind of custard filing and icing on top. So let's dig in. Oh, crunchy. That was a horrible bite. One of my favorite desserts I've been picking up from the PÃ¢tisseries here in Paris have been these awesome tarts. This one here is a lemon tart and it is my favorite. Let's have a look. Oh la la. Galeries Lafayette is a huge department carrying high end brands. The interior is beautiful, but unfortunately we made the mistake of visiting on a Sunday when it were closed. This unusual building is La Madeleine. It was meant to be a temple to glorify Napoleon's army, but halfway through construction plans changed and it became a church. So our preferred method of getting around in Paris is definitely by Metro. There is a really intricate network of different lines. And to save money you can get a pack of ten tickets and it'll save you several Euros. It is definitely the way to go. The metro encompasses 5 zones, but we found that we stayed within zone 1 the whole time we were in Paris. Keep this in mind when you purchase your metro tickets! So we're wrapping things up here. What would be your one tip for visiting Paris? Well, I have recently spent a whole ten days here in summer. I would say that if you really want to visit the art galleries, the museums and all of the main attractions you should probably avoid summer and like either come in the spring or the fall or even winter. Because the lines are insane and sometimes you have to wait like an hour and a half or two hours just to go inside a museum or go inside a church. And you just kill a lot of time. So that is my one tip. Try and avoid summer when the crowds are just everywhere and it is also a bit too hot in my opinion. But that is just me. So how about you? What are your final thoughts on Paris? So my finals thoughts is obviously Paris is one of the top cities in the world in terms of attractions. But it is like any other big gritty city. And you have to come with realistic expectations. There is going to be garbage, there is going to be lines, there is going to be some areas that are a bit of an eyesore. But there is also a lot of beauty and there is also a lot to do here. So I highly you recommend coming but just don't have Paris on such a high pedestal that you're going to be disappointed. And that concludes our guide of the top 50 things to do and see in Paris. We hope you enjoyed watching, and let us know if there are other places you would add to this list.

Welcome to the extended vlog footage portion of this video where we have travel vlogs that cover our day-trip bicycle tour around Versailles, celebrating Bastille Day in Paris as well as food vlogs that cover eating macaroon, crepes and éclairs. Well, Bonjour! Today we have left Paris behind and traded it for Versailles. And what better way to see the gardens and the palace than on a bike. Our first stop of the day was the Versailles Market where we bought a few supplies for lunch - baguettes, cheese, wine, and everything you might need for a French picnic. So we picked up our supplies for our very French picnic. I have my baguette. We have some cheese, some salami, lots of pastries and a salad because we're trying to keep it a little bit healthy and balance all of the sweets we're eating. And now it is time to go and get started with the tour. I've kind of always wanted to ride around in a bike with a baguette sticking out the basket. Yeah, let's hope we don't lose it along the way. From there we biked to Versailles where we got an introductory lesson on the royals who called this place home, including the one and only Marie Antoinette. So just now we are visiting the Petit Trianon and this would have been kind of like a make believe village where Marie Antoinette could escape the palace and just leave everything behind. No one actually lived in these homes but she would hire peasants to just come around and pretend like they were going about their daily routine just so she could have some company but not have people stare at her. So it is kind of like an artificial village and it is really weird. But really pretty at the same time. And now for the view we've all been waiting for. I present to you Versailles. So now for the part of the tour I've been looking forward to - the food. We're going to enjoy our picnic and eat all of the little treats we bought at the market earlier today. The rest of the afternoon was quite leisurely. We continued our tour of Versailles and then finished off in front of the palace, which is truly impressive. At that point we were free to roam on our own, so we visited the Kings and Queens Chambers, as well as the Hall of Mirrors. No filming was allowed inside but if I had to describe it in one word I would say opulent. And just like that, it was time to go back to Paris. Well good morning from Paris. Today is the fourteenth of July which is a major national holiday. Today actually commemorates the storming of the Bastille and the start of the French Revolution. So there is a lot to celebrate. We're going to go watch a military parade and then there is going to be fireworks over the Eiffel Tower. And maybe we may be attending a Fireman's Ball. So let's get started with the day. So they were handing out French flags just outside the metro station. So we're all patriotic and ready to celebrate. We definitely could have come a little bit earlier. Some people came really prepared. Check this out they've got step ladders. Oh, yeah. So the metro is free today and it looks packed. So what are we doing next? Well, we're heading over to the fireman's ball. We just finished watching the fireworks from the comfort of our apartment. It was awesome. We're on the eighth floor of our hotel and we just had such a nice view right out of our window. We didn't even have to go to the Eiffel Tower. We could sit here, relax and just watch it outside of our window. Okay, so let's go find that party now. Yes. So we are going in search of the fireman's ball. Apparently there is one taking place in our neighborhood just two streets away. So we're going to try to find it and see what it is like. So the whole idea of these fireman's balls in these different fire stations is to raise a lot of money for the fire station throughout the year. There is a lot of dancing, there is drinking, there is games, there is food. So we're pretty excited about it. So this is actually quite disappointing. Google has failed me. We looked at the address of fire stations that are supposedly having parties and here we are with a fire station right behind us. And there is no party tonight. There is just a fire truck pulling back into the station because they are working. Well 2 out of 3 isn't bad? Yeah, so no party tonight guys. I guess we're heading back to the hotel. And that is the end of Bastille Day. So today we are having a nice little picnic in the outskirts of Paris. We just felt like we needed to get out of the city for a bit. So we went to a grocery store we picked up a few snacks and now we're in the bois de boulogne and we're going to be having a nice little picnic outside and it is a great day for it. So I'm excited to dig in to all of this food. Oh lÃ lÃ. Oui! So we've been eating a lot in our hotel and also at cafes. So we thought let's go out to the park and have a little feast. So I'm going to show you exactly what we got. We've got two bottles of little wine. They're both really cheap. We've got Couscous. We've got humus. Baguette. Croissant. Ah! Of course. Croissant. Chocolate. Enough Macarons to last us for a week. Plenty of Swiss cheese. Prosciutto. And smoked trout. So what might you be drinking today? I've got Cabernet Sauvignon. And I've really been enjoying this since coming to Paris. This particular bottle of wine. And it is just for personal consumption. It is only 250 mL. I've been picking it up for like a Euro forty, a Euro fifty at grocery stores, so I've been having one per day. It is my guilty little indulgence. And a picnic would not be complete without a little sweet treat. Show us that chocolate. I went to get some chocolat. Ooh la la. Delicious milk chocolate. Chocolat Au Lait. Now that was quite the feast. Now it is time for us to burn off the calories by walking around the park. We're on a boat. On a lake. In the bois de boulogne. And Sam is going to row me around for a whole hour. Yeah! Hmmmmm. Hmmmm. Hmmmm. So another day in Paris calls for another little Parisian treat. Today we have a box full of Macaron. And if you spend any time on Instagram you've probably noticed that when your friends travel to France they are posting pictures of these sweet little treats because they just look so cute really. So we got ourselves a box from a little pÃ¢tisserie and we're going to be sampling them. And it looks like we've got four different flavors of this one. Let's zoom in. And I can't wait to dig in. So what exactly are in these bad boy macaroon? Okay, so I'm not much of a baker but I did read up on these. And they are made with egg whites, icing sugar, regular sugar and then some almond powder. And they also use a little bit of food coloring to give them different colours. So as you can see here we've got four different variations with four different flavors. Well, let's not waste any time. Time for the taste test. So the problem I have is deciding which one to try first. I think maybe I'll try the green one. You know what, it is probably civilized to like nibble on these but I'm going one bite. One shot. Can you guess the flavor? Just wait. Is that pistachio? Who knows? Maybe. I'm pretty sure it is. And wow are those ever sweet. So tasty and really fluffy and as you're biting in to it surprisingly I wouldn't say crunchy but it has a bit of a crispy exterior. Alright, so I'm going with the pink one. Look at you just taking nibbles. All civilized over there. Have a look. So that is like a strawberry jam inside. And we have a little visitor. Hey, puppy. Hi, puppy. Oh, what do you see? Hahahahaha. No! Now that has to be the funniest. That is not even. Is that a photo or video bomb? Dog bomb! That dog was trying to steal my food. Dog bomb. Alright, so where were we? Well, I ate the strawberry before the dog took it away. So let's try another one. Let's go with this one. What is this? It must be vanilla, no? Coconut? Almond. Almond? Seriously? That is almond, yeah. Show a close-up of that. It has a nice little jam in the middle. As you can see the biscuit part is really fluffy. It does have a crispy exterior but it is super moist inside. Alright, last but not least I think we have maybe a brown chocolate one here. That's not chocolate. Can you guess what it is? Coffee? Ah, bingo, coffee. That has a really strong coffee flavor. I think that is actually my favorite one. So macarons are not exactly the cheapest dessert you can have. We've seen them over 20 Euro before. The pack we picked up which was 16 cost 13 Euros. And we've already ate half the box so we've had a bit of an expensive dessert but that is okay. We'll take the rest home and have it later. So today is our first day exploring Paris and we thought we'd sample a bit of the local cuisine. We came across a little stand that was selling CrÃªpes so I ordered one with jambon fromage. So this one is ham and cheese. It looks delicious. We've been walking around for hours and I'm starving so I'm so excited to just bite into this. Oh, yeah. I'm so hungry. We had the tiniest breakfast this morning. This is so good. The cheese is nice and crispy. You can see it has also melted inside. One more bite just to make sure it is edible before I pass it on to Sam. Ha. Oh yeah. That is amazing. And it is a whole wheat crepe so I don't feel so bad about indulging in this delicious treat. Alright, so what do you have there? So finally I get a turn after Audrey's two gigantic bites. Yes. I've been waiting a long time to have an authentic crepe from France. And it is living up to its reputation. So so tasty. The cheese is really salty as well too which I like. Excellent. So now it is time for dessert. So I ordered a crepe with Nutella. Oh show that Nutella. Look at that. The chocolate is all nice and melted. Wow! I'm so excited to bite into this. Mmmmm. Oh yeah. That is the perfect dessert. The crepe is super thin so it feels super light when you're eating it. It's not too filling. And just Nutella. That is my favorite thing to spread on toast, on muffins, on anything. So, it is magic. Mmmm. Well, well it is your turn. That is just like beyond amazing. The only other thing that I'd like to put in here would be bananas. That would be the ultimate. But apparently you can also get these dessert crepes with strawberries, with whipped cream, with other types of flavors. So sample them all! So because we are in a really touristy part of town. Like right across from the Eiffel Tower these crepes are a bit overpriced. We paid 4.50 for the one with Nutella and 5.50 for the one with ham and cheese. I know you can get them a lot cheaper elsewhere in the city but we were starving and it was worth it. This is delicious. Well good morning from Paris. It is about eleven in the morning which means it is time for either a second breakfast or a first lunch. So we've stopped off at a little Patisserie and we picked up a little treat that we're going to be sampling. So here is my little bag. First let me show you, they gave us cute cutlery, wrapped in pink string. Aw. And today we're going to have be having something called Croque-monsieur. I'm going to show you what that looks like in a second. As you can see over here the croque monsieur looks a lot like a grilled cheese sandwich. So it is just two slices of bread, ham and cheese in the middle. You can also have Bechamel sauce and then there is more cheese over top and that has been grilled and melted and it looks ooey an gooey. So I'm going to let Sam take the first bite because I'm always eating the food first. You sure are. Here you go. Alright, time to dig in. Wow, is that ever good. Basically my best way of explaining this is if you've ever had a grilled cheese before this is like a premier grilled cheese. It has an extra layer of cheese on top. Plus you get the ham in the middle and I just love how I think they put a lot of maybe butter on the bread or on the toast. And it just gives it that greasiness that makes it so tasty. And you're up next. I sure am. Mmm. Oh yeah. That is really good. It makes such a nice snack. I mean you could have it as a meal but it is also light enough to have as a snack in between meals too. I don't really know what kind of cheese this is but it is really really tasty. If you know what kind of cheese they use in these sandwiches let us know so I can pick some up in the grocery store. That is a lot of cheese. Check it out. An alternative sandwich to try, instead of the croque-monsieur is the Croque-Madame. And that one is also a grilled cheese sandwich but what they do is they put a fried egg right on top of your sandwich. So it is a little more filling. Um, but yeah I think that is the kind of sandwich that you probably want to order at a restaurant when you're sitting down. Otherwise it could get a little messy. So these are about 3 to 4 Euros. You can pick them up in any French bakery, a Patisserie, and the one tip that I want to give you is ask them to warm it up. It tastes so much better that way. Well, well it is time for another French dessert. So today we are introducing you to the Eclair. And I have two Ã‰clairs in here that I just picked up from the little bakery shop. And it is time for the unveiling. Alright, so I went for the classic chocolate-topped Ã‰clair. So basically it is just a long doughy pastry and the inside is supposedly filled with cream. And it has chocolate icing on top but let's bite in to be sure. Quality control over here. How is that? Actually, mine is not cream. It has like a creamy chocolate pudding in the middle and chocolate icing on top. That is almost liked a filled churro. And the taste? Yeah, it is delicious. It is amazing. I mean the pastry, it is almost like puffed pastry, it is very light and it is hollow inside so then they just fill it. Is it overly sweet? It is not overly sweet. It is more creamy than anything. It is like pudding. That is really good. Surprisingly good. Okay, so you've got a slightly different one. Yeah, mine is the coffee flavored one. You can also get all kinds of different flavors. There are different fruit flavours, there is rum toppings, there is all kinds of toppings. So if you enjoy the classic chocolate one definitely consider trying the other ones as well. Yeah, I think we saw strawberry and pistachio. Yeah, they have pistachio too. Yep. Alright, let's try this coffee one. Again, it is the inside - the cream, the pudding - and this one is of course coffee flavored cream inside. A really generous amount. It is almost like there is more pudding than pastry. Which is delicious. That is surprising. I was expecting the interior to have like a white whipped cream. Like a white pudding. Nope. It has got the flavor to match the icing. Yeah. Okay, so once again the price point for the Eclair. So to pick up an eclair you're looking at 2 to 2.50 Euro and again it is at a French bakery or Patisserie. And what I would recommend having it with is with a coffee or even have it as a dessert. It is delicious and highly recommended.",False,"20160201 - Visit PARIS City Guide ∩╜£ What to SEE, DO & EAT in Paris, France.en.srt"

We are currently exploring the Greek capital. We recently actually spent a few days traveling around Meteora and now we're finishing up our trip here in Athens. We've got two full days to explore the city which isn't a lot of time but we're going to try to do our best. So let's get ready and start exploring. Though our visit was brief, Audrey and I still made it our mission to see as many sights and attractions as possible around Athens. We set out to visit temples and ruins steeped in history, but along the way we also discovered that the Greek capital is a city with a pretty cool vibe, lots of art, and great food. This video guide will showcase 20 things to do in Athens, Greece: Our first stop was one of the most recognized sights in Athens - the Parthenon, which was dedicated to the goddess Athena who was seen as the patron of Athens. From there we visited the Erechtheion, which is an ancient Greek temple on the north side of the Acropolis that was dedicated to both Athena and Poseidon. A nice quiet alternative after or before visiting the Acropolis is coming here to this park. Wandering around there is all of these really cool ruins and there is hardly anybody here. But aside from the ruins, one of the best things about climbing Philopappos Hill was enjoying the views of the Acropolis in the distance...even if there was a whole lot of scaffolding on a few of the structures. Â Beer o'clock! Woah! It's lunchtime here in Athens and we are starving because we've been walking around all morning. So we found a little restaurant, we're going to be eating Greek food obviously, and we are starting out with some homemade bread and black olives. Mmmhmmm. Those are really good olives. So we've now been in Greece long enough to know what some of our favorite foods are and we're having three of them here. We're having Greek salad, which doesn't need too much of an introduction, Moussaka and also Saganaki which is a fried Greek cheese. Yum, now we're just waiting for our order. So first up we're having something called Saganaki which is a fried cheese. And it gets its name from the pan that it is fried in. Apparently, it has two handles. And just have a look over here. It's a nice chunk of cheese, now it is nice and golden from being fried. And it also comes with a little bite of lemon which we can drizzle over top. Oh yeah, drizzle drizzle. And this can be made with three different types of cheese. You can have GruyÃ¨re, Halloumi or Sheep's milk and it is very very salty and very greasy because it has been fried. And it is probably not very healthy but it is so good that we just keep ordering it with every meal here in Athens. Let's have another bite. Mmmm. That is really good guys. And what are you having? Now this next dish is one of my personal favorites. It's called Moussaka. And let's take a look down at it. So you can see that there is a layer of BÃ©chamel sauce, you also have minced meat, you have potatoes and you have eggplant. So we've been told that if we want to catch the best sunset we have to climb Mount Lycabettus here in Athens. So that is why I'm a little out of breathe. We're climbing right now and the sun is about to set so we kind of need to hurry. Let's go. We took a taxi to the base of the hill and then hiked up from there. By the time we reached the top, golden hour had set in casting a beautiful light over the city below. Since it was kind of a windy day, we found shelter at a little cafe at the top where we enjoyed a nice meal while the sun set.Â After sunset we lingered atop Mount Lycabettus for some night views of the city before taking the funicular down to the bottom. Seeing the Acropolis all lit up at night was a pretty cool sight! Next up we visited the Temple of Zeus which once housed the statue of Zeus, and was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. From there we continued on towards Hadrian's Arch. It is believed this monumental gateway was built to celebrate the arrival of the Roman Emperor Hadrian in the city.Â When it comes to shopping, there are a few different options. We made our way to Monastiraki, which is one of the principal shopping districts in Athens. Here we visited both the Flea Market and the antique shops in the area.Â So the sun is starting to set and dinnertime is quickly approaching. We've been walking around the Athen's flea market and we've worked up an appetite so right now we're stopping for some Greek food. We've found a little joint that is serving up Pita souvlaki and Pita Gyro so we've ordered up one of each. Tada! Doesn't that look good? So yeah, ready for another taste test in Greece. What is fascinating is that Gyro means to turn. It's basically rotisserie meat that is cooked on a skewer and you can have all kinds of different things. There is chicken, pork, lamb. So pick whatever you want and it is stuffed inside of a pita. Mmmmm. That is one of my favorite sandwiches I've had in a while. It's so good. The meat is really tender. I really like the sauce. Tzatziki! Yeah, the Tzatziki sauce and you've also got a lot of onions and tomatoes too. So it's really good stuff. So for mine I got the pita souvlaki and souvlaki is basically meat on a skewer so it is not shaved meat like Sam's. So I've got nice chunks in there. And also it comes with French fries, onions and tomatoes. And we can't forget the Tzatziki sauce which is made with yogurt, garlic and cucumber. Delicious! So I'm going to have another bite here. Yeah, we've got a quality control bite going on. Mmmmm. So so good guys. Mmmmm. Psirri is known for its lively nightlife, but what caught our attention when visiting by day was the street art! Some of the pieces were quite elaborate, while others were bordering vandalism, but regardless it was a really interesting neighborhood to wander around.Â So next u we're checking out the Kerameikos Cemetery here in Athens. And this place gets its name because it used to be the potter's quarter and that is where the word ceramics comes from. And this is actually the largest and most ancient cemetery in the city. So we're just going to have a walk around and see what we find. We also made time to go watch the changing of the guard in front of theÂ Parliament building on Syntagma Square. The guards were dressed in their white kilts, red caps, and clogs with pompoms. It was fascinating watching the ceremonial steps be carried out in slow motion. The National Garden is located in the heart of Athens directly behind the Greek Parliament building. It is open to the public from sunrise to sunset and it's a nice spot to decompress if the crowds are starting to get to you. Right now we're visiting Agora Athen's Central Market which has a large fish and meat section. And it is busiest between seven and one PM. And we're seeing lots of locals shopping around. That's right. This is mostly a fish and meat market, so we tried to spare you the gore. It takes a strong stomach to set foot inside, but as you can see there are plenty of other items for sale. The Agora was the central spot in ancient Greek city-states, and it is where people gathered. It was the heart of political, commercial, administrative, religious and cultural activity in the city. Like the name suggests, the Acropolis Museum is located at the foot of the Acropolis and it's mainly focused on the findings of the archaeological site of the Acropolis. It's a cool spot to visit if you want to delve deeper into history. Plaka is an old historical neighborhood located on the eastern slopes of the Acropolis. The place is a bit of a maze with zigzagging streets and a network of staircases that lead up down and around. The neighbourhood has plenty of charms, and there are also lots of restaurants and cafes if you do start feeling a little peckish.Â So we were hoping to visit Hadrian's Library this afternoon but unfortunately we got here a little bit too late and it is already closed for the day. However, I did do a little bit of research, so I can give you a bit of background information on the place. So apparently this was built by the Roman Emperor Hadrian and it used to be his library. So they used to store Papyrus scrolls here and they also had reading rooms and lecture halls. Lastly, if you want to take some Greek recipes back home to your kitchen, consider taking a cooking class.Â So we are wrapping up our time here in Athens. Any surprises or final thoughts to share? Yeah, something that really surprised me were just the amount of stray animals that I saw on the streets. Lots of cats and dogs. But like Istanbul in Turkey they are well taken care of and it was cool just interacting with them. Going up to them and petting them and giving them food and things like that. That was awesome. I also thought there was really good dining options as well. We had a number of really good Greek meals and also some really good International food too. Final thoughts, I think this is a really underrated capital in Europe. A lot like Warsaw in Poland so if you have an opportunity to visit Athens in Greece definitely do so. So what did you think of Athens? Well, I thought it was a really cool city and I actually had a great time here. It kind of reminded me a little bit of Tel Aviv with the Mediterranean feel but also Berlin because it is very artsy and gritty. So it's a really cool place to check out. Great food, lots of attractions. You have a mix of antiquity with urban. So it's really fun and it is unlike any place I've been before, so I would highly recommend it. And that's a wrap for Athens! We hope you enjoyed this city guide and that it'll come in handy when you plan your own trip. If you have any more suggestions of activities that travelers shouldn't miss, feel free to share those in the comments below. Come join us for extended vlog footage as we eat our favorite Greek cuisine and some classic Greek street food. So the sun is starting to set and dinner time is quickly approaching. We've been walking around the Athens flea market and we've worked up an appetite so right now we are stopping for some Greek food. We've found a little joint that is serving up Pita Souvlaki and Pita Gyro. So we've ordered up one of each. Ta da! Doesn't that look good? So yeah, ready for another taste test in Greece. What do we call this in Greece vs back at home? Alright, so here's the deal. Over here it is called Gyros but where I grew up in Canada and also visiting in the US it was called gyro. So it is kind of hard for me to say it as gyros but I'm starting to get used to it. So when you're in Greece call it the gyros. So what is fascinating is that gyros means to turn. It is basically rotisserie meat that is cooked on a skewer and you can have all kinds of different things. There is chicken, pork, lamb. So pick whatever you want and it is stuffed inside of a pita. So enough of me rambling on. Let's actually try it here. Mmmm. That's one of my favorite sandwiches I've had in a while. It's so good. The meat is really tender. I really like the sauce. Tzatziki. Yeah, the tzatziki sauce and you've also got a lot of onions and tomatoes too, so really good stuff. So for mine I got the pita souvlaki. And souvlaki is basically meat on a skewer so it is not shaved meat like Sam's. So I've got nice chunks in there. And also it comes with French fries, onions and tomatoes. And we can't forget the tzatziki sauce which is made with yogurt, garlic and cucumber. Delicious! So I'm going to have another bite here. We've got a quality control bite right now. Mmmmm. So so good guys. So you polished that off quickly. Yeah, I devoured that. Seriously, that was really fast. In terms of price this is basically the cheapest and most affordable meal that you can get in Greece. And it is so delicious. Where we picked it up here, which is a super touristy area, it was 2 Euros each. The giant ones were 3.50 and if you're walking down say more of a residential area, somewhere that is not in a touristy zone, you can pick one up in the one to two Euros range. It's lunchtime here in Athens and we are starving because we've been walking around all morning. So we found a little restaurant. We're going to be eating Greek food obviously. And we are starting out with some homemade bread and black olives. Those are really good olives. The pit. Hahaha. Bread with olive oil. Can't go wrong. So we've now been in Greece long enough to know what some of our favorite foods are. And we're having three of them here. We're having Greek salad which doesn't need too much of an introduction, Moussaka and also Saganaki which is a fried Greek cheese. Yum, now we are just waiting for our order. So first up we're having something called Saganaki which is a fried cheese. And it gets its name from the pan that it is fried in. Apparently it has two handles and just have a look over here. It's a nice chunk of cheese. Now it is nice and golden from being fried. And it also comes with a little bit of lemon which we can drizzle over top. Oh yeah, drizzle, drizzle, drizzle. And this can be made with three different types of cheese. You can have GruyÃ¨re, Halloumi or Sheep's milk. And it is very very salty and very greasy since it has been fried. And it is probably not very healthy but it is so good that we just keep ordering it with every meal here in Athens. Let's have another bite. Mmmmm. That is really good guys. Good stuff. And what are you having? Now this next dish is one of personal favorites. It's called Moussaka. And let's take a look down at it. So you can see that there is a layer of BÃ©chamel sauce, you also have minced meat, you have potatoes and you have eggplant. So apparently this is a pretty old recipe, right? Yeah, this dish dates back to the former Ottoman Empire. And you can also find it in countries such as Albania and Turkey presently. So time for me to finally have a bit of this. Wow, it is so thick! It's like a Lasagna almost. It almost looks like a Sheppard's Pie to me. Yeah, that's actually a better comparison. Mmmm. That's fantastic. And because we're trying to keep this a balanced meal we did order a salad. A Greek salad because this is Greece. So as you can see we've got tomatoes, feta, cucumbers, black olives. We've got some peppers and olive oil drizzled all over top with a little bit of oregano sprinkled as well. So it looks really really good. Let's take a bit of that. Oh yeah. Don't forget the feta cheese. Yeah, that's right. Let's get a bit of everything. Onions. Cheese. Tomato. Hahaha. Mmmm. That's really nice. The olive oil has a really special flavor here. You can almost taste the olives. It's just really good and a nice and refreshing salad. Really nice. And price point for that delicious Greek meal? So for all of that food we paid about thirty Euros. Keep in mind we did eat in a touristy zone and if you're in a more residential area you can maybe expect to pay 20, 25 Euros for that.",False,"20160107 - Visit ATHENS City Guide ∩╜£ What to SEE, DO & EAT in Athens, Greece.en.srt"

Distinct influences come from its three main geographical zones – the coast, the jungle and the Andean Highlands and various immigrant cultures. What you find is a melting pot of flavors receiving International recognition. Peruvians are proud of their cuisine and for good reason. In this video we try to explore as many different kinds of Peruvian foods as possible. With only three weeks in Lima we had our work cut-out for us given the diversity of things to try. What exactly did we sample? Well, we ate Churros, Picarones, Turron, Ceviche, Tejas, Cremoladas, Tamales, Pan Con Chicharron, Alfajores, Cuy, King Kong, Mazamorra Marada, Pisco Sour, Inca Kola, Doña Pepa, Kamote, Sublime, Chicha Morada and Besos de Moza just to name a few. The following is a compilation of individual taste tests making up this Peruvian Food Guide. So today we are on a food mission. We are looking for a place called Manolo and we're going to be eating some Churros. Let's go eat. So getting there is half the journey. Now the other half is going to be eating it. And here we are - Manolo's! So we went all out here and got one of each. So this is the one with chocolate, vanilla and dulce de leche. Talk about a trio. I know. Just for me. So in case you've never tried Churro before it is just a deep-fried dough with like a hole in the middle so I guess you can fill it up with something really sweet and tasty. So the one I'm having right now has dulce de leche. Mmmm. Oh my gosh, that's warm and gooey and sweet. So do you think it is fresh out of the oven? Oh, it definitely is. Wow! Decisions, decisions, decisions. The decisions I have to make in life. Okay, I'll go with chocolate. Mmmmm. His eyes are closed. That's a good sign. You're totally right about it being freshly made. I can taste the warm gooeyness of that chocolate inside. You're not getting a bite of that. Last but not least, Vanilla! Mmmm. It is like a vanilla pudding or like the filling you get inside the Boston cream donuts. Mmmm. I still think I like this one better though - Dulce De Leche. It's my number one. So that was a very delicious snack and it wasn't very expensive at all. I lost my receipt but I think I paid somewhere near twelve Soles which would be around four dollars for those three very tasty, very sweet churros. Highly recommended. So seriously, it is probably a good idea that we're walking home right now. I honestly could have had about five more of those dulce de leche churros. And we've got more food videos coming soon. So it is lunchtime here in Lima and today we are at a local restaurant in Miraflores. It is called El Punto Azul and we are going to be trying the Peruvian national dish Ceviche. And judging by how packed this place is I have really high expectations. We had to come and sit up on the second floor. Our food has arrived. I couldn't be more excited. What do we have? Yeah. That was certainly worth the wait. So right now we have Ceviche over here and it comes with onions, sweet potatoes and also giant yellow corn. And look over to this side and we have something called Causa. Which is made with yellow sweet potato and there is some kind of seafood in the middle. You know what - that almost looks too cute to eat. It is shaped just like a fish. So the big question. What is Ceviche? It is actually a seafood dish. It is raw fish and it is cured with lemon juice and it is also served with a few spices and some onions. So I'm taking my first bite. Mmmm. That is so good. I think it is better than sushi honestly. That is amazing. Second bite. Nice and lemony citrusy. So good. And now I usually have to tell you this but please leave some for me too. So for my first bite I'm going to try mine with some aji. Oh, go easy on that. How is it? It's just so amazing. For me it is like enhanced Sashimi. Just all of the preparation they put into that sour sauce is just so good. One thing I've absolutely been loving since we've come to Lima is this giant sized corn. These kernels are massive. Check it out. Those are big. Okay, so our next dish is Causa. Let's dig in. I almost feel guilty eating this it is so beautifully presented. Look at that. Sorry, little fish. Sorry. That is seriously good. I can taste a lot of different ingredients there. So the big mystery over here is we're trying to decide what is actually in this dish. Okay. And what do you think? So Causa, it is made with yellow mashed potatoes. I asked for the one that comes with seafood and it also looks like it has some avocado and mayonnaise. So it is really tasty. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And for our drink we're having something that is called Chicha Morada. And it is a juice made from purple corn. Very tasty. Highly recommended. This is the best I've ever had. Like they've put some extra spices and ingredients. It has got a real kick to it. I don't know what is in it but. It is really sweet and really refreshing. Especially on a hot day like today. Well now that we've finished all of the fish we're left with nothing but lemon juice. But the good news it tastes delicious. It's amazing. You know what it kind of tastes a bit like Tom Yum. Tom Yum soup from Thailand. This sauce down here. I have no idea what we were thinking ordering a third plate of food. Like this is just ridiculous. We're already full. What have we got? I think we went a little overboard. This is basically breaded and deep-fried seafood, so there is a little mix of everything. We have some pieces of fish. Some shrimp. And other things that I just don't recognize so we'll have to go for it. Take a bite and taste it I guess. And what are those? They look like giant potato wedges? Well, this is called Yucca. And it is kind of like a root or a potato. It is very fiberous and you eat it like French Fries basically. This is a fried Yucca. It looks starchy. Yeah. I really like these. So someone still had room for dessert. Honestly, I don't know what the heck I was thinking. This is one of the biggest meals I've had in a long time. But when they brought that dessert tray over with all of those different postres I just could not contain myself. This looks amazing. We don't even know technically what it is called but it has got dulce de leche. It has got nuts and it has got chocolate, so it is going to be really good I'm sure. And a slight correction over here. That was coconut not nuts. Oh my gosh that is so good. So so decadent. I'm sure it has got a zillion calories. So total cost. That meal came to 118 Soles which would be roughly around forty dollars and that included drinks. We got three dishes and one dessert to share so it was a lot of food. We are beyond stuffed and everything was delicious. Well, Hello! Today we are doing a Peruvian taste test. And we're going to be trying a few different chocolates, snacks, chips and just things we've found in a supermarket. We basically raided the aisles at Wong's which is the biggest supermarket here in Peru and picked up random stuff that looked Peruvian, look authentic. So we're going to be sampling that and giving you our thoughts. So first up I'm trying something called Chifles and it looks like it is going to be sliced bananas or sliced plantain and chip form. So let's open that. Use those big muscles of yours. Oh, yeah. That was relatively easy. That is what it looks like. A salty banana chip. It makes a nice snack. I think if you're at a bar waiting for your beer to get there you can be snacking on these and some peanuts. Pretty good. Thumbs up for Chifles. Alright, I'm trying Chin Chin. Chiny freakin' chin. So I have no idea what these are. I'm guessing cookies. And it looks like they may have some sparkles on them, so let's open it up. Let's open it up. Yep, I was right and they are shaped liked. I mean it is round shaped. It looks like a cookie. Time to try it. Mmmm. Would you like a cup of tea with that? I could use some. You know what, since coming to Peru I've been quite dehydrated. It is really humid here, so I could use any source of water. But yeah, these are good. Definitely sweet and you taste the chocolate and you really taste the sprinkles. It is not an overpowering taste though so a nice little cookie to have maybe as an afternoon snack. Approved. So next up I'm trying Andean Native Potato Chips. So according to the back these are going to be multi-colored potato chips. So I'm expecting purple potato chips here. I bet they are going to be dark purple. That would be my guess- dark purple almost black. Okay, there is two different kinds in the bag. I'm going to show you. Look at this? So there is like red and white potato chips. It looks kind of like sweet potato and then purple and white potato chips. I was totally wrong I was thinking a really dark kind of black potato chip. They almost look like they've been dyed with a few droplets of color but this is all natural people. These are real potatoes. Okay, the purple one tastes like a regular potato chip. The flavour doesn't. Or the colour doesn't change the flavor rather. Next up, Inca Kola. And I must say you're not going to find too many colas around the world that are yellow in color. So let's crack this open here. So this is what the Incas used to drink right Sam? Oh yeah, of course. You know when they were bottling their beverages back in the day mass producing them. Of course that is what they had. Alright. You know what, this is not my first time to try this and I have to say that most colas around the world, like I mean by specialty colas that are unique to certain countries, I tend not to like. But I really like this Inca Kola. The reason being is that it is not too fizzy or carbonated and when you drink it, it is really really refreshing on a hot day. And most days in Lima are hot this time of year. So does it taste like fanta, ginger ale or any other kind of drink you've had before. No, honestly it doesn't. It really has its own unique flavour and so I can't even really compare it to something. Maybe sort of like a light cream soda but that is about all I can compare it to. So next up I found a candy that is called Perita, which means little pear. And even the shape of the candy like it looks like a little pear and it is coloured like yellow and red. It is cute like a little pear. Little multi-coloured pear. There must be like a hundred candies in here. Show me. I don't think we can finish all of this. Oh, gosh. We're going to have to share with our relatives. Okay, I'm going to try my little pear. I think it looks like hard candy. I thought it might be a little gummy at first but. Let's see that. Very cute. Red on one side. Yellow on the other. The perfect time to model my manicure. You did just get a manicure. Why don't you tell us about that while you're eating it. Mmmm. This tastes like banana. The yellow side is banana for sure. Interesting. What does it say? It says it is flavored like pears guys. This tastes like banana in my mouth. Maybe our taste buds are little off. Now how about that manicure you just had? Pink. Cua Cua! Quack, quack, quack! So I think this wafer or chocolate bar here is named after the sound of the duck. And you can see a pretty cool duck. I think it is like you know skateboarding here. It's acting all hipster. So let's see how this tastes. Let's see how this tastes. Yeah, it is definitely a wafer. So let's try it. Mmmm. Yeah, that is your standard chocolate covered wafer. And compared to a lot of other wafers I've tried this has a pretty decent layer of chocolate. So if you're looking for your chocolate fix this is the wafer for you. Okay, so this is my next treat. It is called DoÃ±a Pepa. And I'm guessing it is a cookie. I don't know. I just bought it. Let's unveil the product. Ooh la lah. Or maybe it is chocolate? Woah. I'm dropping all of the sprinkles on the floor. What are those? Are those sprinkles? Yeah. Okay, let's take a bite. I think it is a cookie. Mmmm, okay. There we go. So it is a cookie. It has chocolate in the middle. The whole cookie is then bathed in chocolate and it has got sprinkles all over the extrerior. And it tastes. And it is really sugary. But I like the crunch of the sprinkles. It's a fun treat. And here I've got my Camote chips which are sweet potato chips. That's what you've told me. Yes. I wouldn't lie. And this is the Wong brand. So you said these. This is one of the biggest supermarkets in Peru? In Lima? So, oh yeah, I can totally tell these are sweet potato chips. Check these out. You can totally tell they are sweet potatoes. Wow, those are very very crunchy chips. Um, I think typically when you eat sweet potatoes you sort of associate them with being rather sweet. These are not sweet. They're salty. So it is kind of an alternative to a potato chip. I think it is a little bit of an acquired taste. I wouldn't say it is my favourite right now but. Have another bite, maybe it will be. Yeah, not bad. There he has acquired the taste. Hahaha. Oh, my! Alright, so next up is something called Inka Corn and it is ginormous corn all the way from Cusco. And this bag is cheese flavored. So let's dig in. So is that Queso? Yeah, Sam has been working on his Spanish eh. Yeah, I've expanded my vocabulary from like five to ten words. Okay. Look at that. Look at the size of the kernels. Gosh, those are huge. Let's put it up by your finger nail so we can get a. Oh, it is bigger than your finger nail. Bigger than your thumbnail. That's crazy. I have to sneeze. Go ahead. I'm okay, I'm okay. It is just the cheese powder on the corn. It's that strong? Woah. Clogged up your nostrils for a second. Just for a second. Okay. Have you ever had Corn Nuts in Canada? Have you ever tried that snack? I've had that. It smells like from the distance I'm at. It smells a lot like Corn Nuts. Oh, yeah. So I think I might like those. I think you need to chew these rather carefully. Like they're quite hard. I almost feel like you could break a tooth. You can hear the crunch? Can you hear the crunch? Oh yeah. Yeah, they are a nice little snack. I've actually seen that being served at the bar or like at a restaurant before you get your main meal they bring you a little bowl and it is called Canchita. It is just the giant corn kernels. So, yeah. So next up this is our assorted potato chip bag and we've got all kinds. We've got regular, we've got sweet potato. We've got something called Yucca and we have - what is the other one? I think beetroot. Maybe beetroot. Let's open this up. It should be an assortment of colors. If you can look into here. Have a look. Yeah, you can see all of the different colours. Look at that. So I'm going to try to find. I already did a sweet potato. I'm going to try to find one of the purple ones. Oh, I've got one. So here is the purple one. Would this be the beetroot one? Maybe. Maybe. Let's try it. Really salty. Okay, yeah. That definitely has a bit of kick to it. It's just different from regular potato chips. It's like really hard to explain. It tastes so much similar to sort of a regular potato chip but it just got like that little tangy taste. I don't really know what it is to be perfectly honest. Next one. Alright, let's try one more. Okay, I'm not sure what this is. I would guess regular potato. You know what I think that might be the Yucca one. Yeah. Yeah. It has a more of a fibrous taste. It's pretty good though. I like that one more. Time for the chocolate bar. This one is called Sublime. And it is white chocolate. I've only ever had the regular milk chocolate so this should be interesting. And I know the regular milk chocolate comes with nuts. Like peanuts. So I imagine this one will too. You can see the logo. Dadadah. You can see the chunks of peanut. Mmmm. That's good. It's not like high quality chocolate but for a regular milk chocolate bar Ido enjoy Sublime. So next up we have Chicha which is purple corn. And this is one of our favourite refreshing drinks to have here in Lima. And so now we're going to try it in candy form. Crack that open. And do you know something I've been noticing about Peruvian snacks and candy that I really like. And that is that the bags are easy to open. It doesn't. Like some bags from since we've been back in Canada. It's like a. You have to get scissors just to get them open. These just boom open in one shot which is awesome. Alright, so these are the candies. They are called Chica Morada. Yep. Okay, let's try the Chicha Morada. Yeah, they are quite small. Alright, so it is kind of shaped like a Halls or something. Like one of those cough candies and a yeah, it is purple. Just like the purple corn it is made out of. That's really good. It tastes very similar to the drink so I really like the drink, so I really like this. It is sweet. It has a little bit of a. It has a corn taste. It also has a bit of a spiciness taste. I'm not sure what kind of ingredients they put in to give that kind of kick but I really like it. Mmmmm. So next we've got Sublime or sublime. And I'm going to try to read these ingredients. Chocolate con leche con mani which means milk chocolate with peanuts. Alright, let's open this up. So yeah, it's a kind of a thick chocolate. You can see it. Chunky chocolate bar. Chunky chocolate bar. Let's try that. Mmmm. That is pretty decent chocolate. I mean, I can't compare it to and say it is as good as European chocolate but it surprisingly better than I thought. And I haven't had chocolate in quite a while, so yeah I'm enjoying this. Another bite. Mmm. I love those peanuts. So next up we've got Besos de Moza which apparently according to translation is kisses from a girl or kisses from a mistress. And you know what, these look so similar to something we've had before in Israel called Krembo. So a shoutout to our friends in Isreal. All our Isreali friends who like Krembos. We're going to see if this is like a Krembo or not. It looks exactly like one. Alright, now it is time to try this bad boy. So should I attack it from the top or from the bottom? I think it is supposed to be from the top if I remember correctly. Mmmmm. Yeah, look at that marshmallow. Mmmm. I think this is the treat I've enjoyed the most so far. This is really sweet. And yeah it is a right up there with a Krembo. I wouldn't say it is better but it is right up there. Now find the cookie. Alright, so that means I need to attack from the bottom. There isn't much of a cookie. It's a real real tiny layer. Look at that. It's not crunchy at all. Wow, that is pretty good. Yum. Probably my favourite snack of all the ones I've tried today. We can tell by the crumbs on your lips. Audrey. Yes. Which one was your favourite? Alright, so this was my favourite. Dona Pepa. And that was the cookie with the sprinkles all over. I just thought it was a really fun snack. Really colorful. Really tasty. I like sweet stuff. Look at you going in for another bite. Hahaha. I actually am. I'm like eying it. Let's just have another small bite. It's really good. That was my favorite. And I actually didn't have a least favorite. Like I thought all of the treats were pretty tasty. Yeah, I think that is a wrap. So what were your favorites and least favorite? So alright, I had two favorites. One of them being Inca Kola. That is just a cola I really like. It is super refreshing. It is delicious. And on a hot day you can't beat it. And the other one I really like was the Besos de Moza because I love Krembos and I love those too. That marshmallow and chocolate combo is a winning winning winning combo. Now, in terms of what I didn't like the sweet potato chips were a little bit dissapointing. I was kind of hoping for something a little sweeter. They were salty and to be perfectly honest I prefer regular potato chips, so that is something I could probably you know not necessarily have again. And look who we have - a third person to taste test. It's Maki. Maki the pooch. Maki the pooch. Yes, you get back to scratching. You get back to scratching. Alright, and that's a wrap. That's our Peruvian snack food taste test. And please let us know in the comments if you've tried any of these foods. What was your opinion? Was there anything we left out. Was there something we could have added into the mix. Please let us know in the comments section below. Toodles. Well, Hello there! So this afternoon we are at Parque Kennedy and we are here for some dessert. We've been eating like pigs all day long but there is still a bit of room left for a little something sweet, so we're going to try Picarones. Look at this - I already have a bee following me because of the honey. Isn't that amazing? Woah. And we thought about getting two orders. Haha. This will be plenty. Alright, so here we have our dessert. These are Picarones and they are like fried rings. Fried dough made with sweet potato and pumpkin and they have a sweet honey drizzled all over. And they're uniquely Peruvian cuisine. Oh, yes. So I'm just going to go for it and take a bite. Dig right in. Mmmmm. These are so fresh. Wow. Really fluffy and airy. Can you taste that honey? Oh, yeah. I sure can. And like they are so light I've already finished half of one. I understand why they give you five. You can just devour them in a few minutes. And we've got a guest who is interested as well. Hi, Kitty. Hello, Mr. Meowzers. So as I mentioned previously, this is a uniquely Peruvian dish. And as such there isn't an English equivalent. I suppose we could call it a Peruvian doughnut with honey. And so that is what we're going with. And this is my first bite. My first time to ever try this so I am really excited. I am sopping it up in honey. Woo Hoo!. Honey syrup. Let's try this. Oh my gosh. That is so good. You know what it reminds me of? It kind of reminds me of a oversaturated waffle with maple syrup or honey. It's like where you pour like three times as much as you actually need on the waffle and then you eat it. This is what it tastes like right here. Mmmm. I don't mess around when I eat food. What can I say. So this tasty dessert only cost us five Soles. That would be one sole for each donut that we've already eaten. That is pretty affordable actually with the exchange rate it would be about a dollar seventy-five and you do get a lot of food for that. So if you're looking to pair this sweet treat with a little beverage you can get something called Chicha which is a purple corn juice that goes perfectly with it. So there are five of these but only two of us. So who gets that third one? We split it down the middle Sam. Oh, I don't agree with that. Sleepy kitty. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. There are hundreds of cats in this park. Look here is another one. Meow. Meow. That was a delicious sweet treat and we're going to be back at this park again very soon to film some more street food. So we are back at our favourite park once again. This is Parque Kennedy and we are here for dessert. What else. So today we are going to be sampling something that is called TurrÃ³n. So part of reason we like coming here are all of the cats. There must be hundreds of them and they are so friendly. They just want to be scratched and petted. Look there is another one coming up right behind you. Oh, Hello. Hello, cat. Look at you. You're a sweet one. You're still a kitten. Oh, it is sitting on me. I've made a new friend. Hi, Cat. Hello, cat. So what have you got over here? Okay, so we ended up getting two different things. This is called Turrone. And over here, oh my goodness, it already got stuck to my leg. This giant thing over here is called Torreja. So they look kind of different but they are both actually made with the same ingredients. So all this is is deep-fried flower and then they drizzle honey over top. Sounds good enough to me? Yeah. Let's try it. The first bite. The first bite. Big moment here. Here we go. It looks sticky. I think you bit off a little more than you can chew there. This is interesting. It's getting stuck to my teeth. A little difficult to talk right now but the honey kind of has an orange flavor to it. And also it is a lot stickier than honey. I wonder if it is more of a marmalade. Kind of an orange marmalade. Do you think, maybe? Maybe. They told me honey but I don't know. No honey for the bunny. Mmmm. It is nice. Really crsipy. The dough itself is really not really very flavorful because I mean it is just flour but the honey that is what you can taste. The orange flavoured honey. Want to have some? Alright, it is my turn. Oh, you can take a bigger bite than that. I don't want to get all of that sticky stuff all over my face. We don't have any napkins out here. This probably looks more like French Fries with like ketchup drizzled all over them but in fact this is the second dessert we're going to be trying. And I've noticed since we've come to Lima that cakes and other things tend to have these little doughy bits. Crunchy doughy bits and so let's try it here. Like I don't see myself breaking it off with my hand. I'm just going to take a bite. Mmmm. That is good. You know what, I think I actually prefer this one to the big pizza shaped one I had. Similar flavour to the previous one. More or less the same thing. Just kind of slightly different. You know what? It kind of tastes like Fruit Loops. When you really chew on it for a while it is like really sugary Fruit Loops. Maybe that is why we like it so much. We grew up eating Fruit Loops. Fruit Loops guys. Fruit Loops. Peruvian Fruit Loops. So how much did today's dessert cost? Well, this was probably our cheapest street food / dessert that we've had since we've come to Peru. This one came to three Soles each. So that is a dollar for each of those delicious little snacks we had. So you know, if you're on a budget you can really load up on those. So we're just going to go for a little walk around the park and then we're going to head home for more food. Whal else. All we do is eat. Meow, meow, meow. Oh, look at that. Meow, meow, meow little kitty. You're a cute one aren't you. Oh, it is purring. I can feel it purring. Hi Kitty. Hi Kitty. So today we're going to be trying something called Alfajores. And this is something you can find throughout South America but it varies from country to country. So today we're having Peruvian Alfajores, so I'm going to open the box for a big reveal. And we've ordered a few different varieties. Wow, that looks awesome. We're very used to the Argentinian ones. Yeah. So what I've found particularly fascinating upon researching Alfajores is that it has Arabic origins. Then it made its way to Spain and now it has become immensely popular all over South America. Right, so this is the original which I'm going to be trying first. So it is basically two layers of a crumbly cookie. Let's zoom in on that. It has. You can zoom in. It has Manjar Blanco in the middle which is kind of like Dulce De Leche. It is a milk caramel. It is very sweet. And then it has like a white powdery sugar like icing sugar on top. It looks like a very generous amount of the dulce de leche. So this is a miniature version of the original Alfajor And it is what I'm trying first. Bite sized. Mmmm. Those are really nice. Up to standard? Mmmm. Nice and sugary. I think it would be nice for breakfast or for a little snack. Heck, maybe even dinner. I could see you eating that for dinner. You like your sweets. It is really nice. Alright, I'm also going to have the original one. And Alfajores kind of have a special place in my heart because during our wedding one of the things we made together as a family with Audrey's family is a huge batch of Alfajores which we ate of course and shared to our guests. So high expectations here and it does have some positive memories for me as well. Mmmm. One big bite. That's pretty good. Okay, so I'm interested in having this one next because it looks like chocolate. Let's hold that up. I'll zoom in. Oh yeah, it's got a chocolate layer. Okay. I'm trying to figure out what the filling is. Do you think it might be a dark fruit of some sort kind? Maybe like a plum. Not a plum but a date. A date filling? I think. No, it's chocolate-y. I think maybe they took the Manjar Blanco that we had for the other one and just added some chocolate and mixed it together. That would be my guess. And the cookie is chocolate. How does it compare to the original? I think I prefer the original personally. But this is nice as well, it is very tasty. And mysterious. So you got a little excited about the next one. Well, we were shooting a photo for our cover photo image of this video and I just got a little carried away. I was just planning on having my teeth on it but my brain. My subconscious brain took over and basically forced me to have a bite. Okay, first 'unofficial bite' over here. Yeah, that is really nice. It kinds of reminds me of the original Alfajor but the big difference here is that it has a crunchier exterior and if you see over on this side it is covered in what appears to be walnuts. How about the cookie dough? Does it also have nuts? Is it crunchy? Yeah, it is definitely crunchier than the original one which is more like a thin cookie. Alright, and then we are down to one. The one and only lonely one. So it is my turn. I believe this one has honey. That is what I was told. It looks sticky. It looks big. Oh, my gosh. Look at that. Okay, it is like a triple one. So triple layered Alfahor. Dude, it is spilling all over the place. Let's get a really good zoom in on that. Like that is just...woah. That is some serious, serious topping overflow there. And the taste? Well, that is not your average honey that is for sure. It's really thick and sticky. I've had it in a few other Peruvian desserts but I still don't know what it is made out of. Yeah, it has a stronger flavor than regular honey. Would you care to have a bite and tell me your thoughts? Maybe you can decipher the great mystery. Alright, the things that Audrey makes me do. The things I do in front of the camera. Oh my gosh. I'm just kidding. This is awesome. First bite here. Woah, I probably should have had a smaller bite. Yeah, that kind of reminds me of the Turron sauce honey. I have a feeling that maybe it mixed with some kind of date or possibly a kind of marmalade because yeah it just doesn't have a pure honey taste in my opinion. So we picked up this little goodie box from La Casa Del Alfajor which translates to the house of the Alfajor. And a yeah, it was a great little goodie box but I guess what sort of surprised me was that I ended up liking the original the most. How about you? Same. Loved the original. So I guess the take home message for today is don't mess with that awesome classic good flavor. So this afternoon we're at a place called Cremoladas Curich. Yep, got the name right and we're trying a kind of like icy cold dessert called Cremolada. And basically this is shaved ice, finely shaved ice and then it is topped with like a juice or a syrup that has like a tropical fruit flavor. So I've chosen Chicha Morada which is a purple corn. And Sam over here has chosen Lucuma. So we're going to being try these. Very local flavours. Oh, yeah. Very much so. Just mixing it around. Ice cold. Purple goodness. Ready for my first bite. This is purple corn. Mmmm. It tastes. It doesn't taste like corn. It tastes more like syrup. Purple syrup? I mean, like what would you call this back at home? It that like a kind of a slushie. A slushie! There you go. It's a slushie. So I'm having a purple corn slushie. Do you actually like it? So, so? Yeah, I mean it is ice. Flavored ice. It's okay. What can I say. So I've got something called lÃºcuma. And it is a local fruit which I've kind of fallen in love with since being in Peru. I mean you can't really describe what a fruit tastes like. A mango tastes like a mango, a peach tastes like a peach, and a lucuma tastes like a lucuma. So let's try it here. It is definitely sweet. It has that sweet tropical taste, so I can say that. This one seems really thick. I really like that. I have a feeling that mine is quite a bit thicker than yours. If you just look down at it here you can see that it is really thick. And you can really taste the fruit. It has definitely been sweeten but it is not overpowering. The fruit tastes really comes out so I'm actually really enjoying this right now. So it is nothing out of the ordinary but if you're in Lima on a really hot day this is definitely a very refreshing little slushie drink and in terms of costs. Those buses! In terms of costs it was five Soles and seventy cents which is less than two dollars. So not a bad deal. It is actually kind of getting chilly here so I'm cold eating this. I can't believe you're wearing a sweater. I'm wearing a t-shirt and shorts and I think this is perfect weather. So it is time to get back home before Audrey suffers from hypothermia. You know it is only like twenty-five degrees outside or something. Pish posh. It must be like eighteen and I'm freezing. So this afternoon we are at the Love Park here in Lima and we're going to be doing yet another taste test. We're trying something that is called Tejas and Chocotejas. This is a dessert that comes from Ica and there are two different varieties. So first up we're going to be trying Tejas, which is a sweet. The exterior is covered in white sugar and then the inside has something inside called Manjar Blanco which is similar to Dulce de Leche which is like a milky caramel. It is really sweet. Some of them are filled with nuts, filled with different fruits, so we're going to try one. So I'm first up here with the pecan Tejas. You can see over here. Pecanas. I think according to you this should be white. It should be. Oh, Wow it is. It should be coated in white sugar. Wow! It's almost got that sliminess. Oh my gosh, I'm getting my hands all sticky. I think that is because I put it in the fridge. It really shouldn't be slimey. Okay. Oh my gosh. That is so sweet. Tasty. Show us what it looks like? It is just loaded with sugar. It's almost like eating icing with caramel inside and nuts of course. Pecans. Mmmm. I really like this. So next up I'm trying a Chocotejas, so unlike Sam's which was coated in a white sugar the chocotejas is actually coated in chocolate like the name suggests. And this one is lemon flavoured. And you know what? It is a different shape. Yeah, it is more like. It looks like more of a square. Let's take a bite. Mmmmmm. I was expecting it to be really sour because of the lemon but it is really not. It is still really sweet, so you have the Manjar Blanco, which is the caramel. I'm just going to zoom in on that. And then you can kind of see the lemon. It is like the lemon skin and they've turned it into a kind of marmalade. And yeah, it is not sour at all. This is great. I like it. So next up I'm having Chocolate Tejas con leche con mani. And mani means peanuts, so I'm excited about this one. Just judging by touching it right now this one is even slimier than the one before. Okay, it was in the fridge. Whoops. Just trying to break that off so I don't have any paper on it. And again this shape is different from the two we've tried previously. So I like my peanuts so I have high expectations. Oh man, that is like a Snicker's bar on steroids. That is like so so tasty. Really good quality chocolate and just a massive generous amount of caramel. And then you've got the great big peanuts that I'm biting into too, so I mean this for me is about as close as it gets to being a perfect chocolate bar. And last but not least we have one called chocotejas pasas borrachas. And pasas borachas means drunk raisins so I'm assuming they've been soaked in some kind of alcohol. We like our drunk food. So let's unveil. We sure do like our drunk food. There we have it. Okay, it is chocolate covered. I haven't found any raisins yet. No drunkenness? No, raisins. Oh, okay at the bottom. Show me. I think there is some kind of raisin paste. Oh, no there is a raisin. Show me. Where? Oh, we found it. We discovered the raisin. There we go. So you've got to take a bite with the raisin now. Come on, do it properly. Oh, that's a drunk raisin for sure. That's been soaked in alcohol for a long time. Like drunk drunk? Partying all night long raisin? I would say so, yeah. It's really good. I think this is actually my favorite one so far. Alright, to wrap things up. What I really liked about those was that each and every one was really unique and different. Not only in shape but in taste and texture. Some of them reminded me of fudge whereas others reminded me more of eating like a chocolate turtle. And in terms of pricing each of those costs 3 Soles and 50 cents, so perhaps a little pricy in terms of a small treat but it was gourmet chocolate with the best of ingredients. Now to take footage of the guy on the tightrope. So we thought we were going to be ending that video with the food but we've got some paragliding to show you. So we are back at Manolo, a restaurant that we've already been to a couple of times before. And the reason we are here is because the other day we were walking by and we saw that they have the biggest sandwich in the world. It is literally like this high and we're going to eat it. Oh, yes. Gracais. Whoops. You can keep filming. You are supposed to be talking. Gracias. One of the more embarrassing things to admit about our travels is that when we find a place we really really like we tend to come back again and again. And sometimes we feel a little bit guilty because we think we should be trying more spots but this Manolo place is so awesome we're back here yet again. This is for certain the biggest sandwich we've ever had. I think there might be six layers of bread here. Can you count that for us. Well, some are double layers so we actually have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 slices of bread. So the thing is how do we actually attack this sandwich. Like this thing is a behemoth. I'm starting in the middle where the avocado is located because that is what I like in a sandwich. So I don't think I've ever eaten a sandwich with a fork ana knife before but this is so massive and so messy that it seems like the only way. You're already spilling it. It's good. Oh, yeah. So I'm attempting to pick this sandwich up and maybe take a bite out of it. I don't even know how I'm going to attack it here. Um. Alright. I guess I'll just dig in. I've got it all over my face. But you know what. I went right for the egg and the avocado and that is amazing. Mmmm. So can you tell us what kind of ingredients we had in this monster sandwich? Well, it is a really eclectic blend. Like there is avocado, there is chicken breast, there is hotdog and I think I tasted a little bit of sweet potato. Then you've got all of the other kinds of regular things you'd find in a sandwich like tomatoes, lettuce and what not. But it is just a super loaded sandwich. If there is only one thing I could change I think I would go with whole grain bread instead of white. This piece of pie kind of reminds me of the Emerald City in the Wizard of Oz. I am wondering if Mr. Oz lives right on top here. And this is what I really came for - Lemon Meringue pie. It is the biggest slice I have ever seen in my entire life. And Lemon Meringue pie is my favorite so I'm pretty excited about this dish. Ho ho ho. I'm going to dig in. Oh, this is impossible. This is impossible. Got enough Meringue on your spoon? I think so. Ready. Oh my gosh. Pie-tastic? Fluffy. It's like biting into a sugar cloud. It's amazing. I'm just about to destroy the Wizard of Oz's home. He's way up top in his tower here. And I am very sorry, I just knocked it down. You're right, that is the lightest, fluffiest meringue of all -time which just dissolves as soon as you put it right into your mouth. It is amazing. So that was a rather affordable meal. The sandwich which was called the Pijama sandwich was 18 Soles. That is six dollars. And the lemon meringue pie was 12 Soles which worked out to be four dollars. So we ate a lot, we shared it and it was a really affordable meal. So good morning from Lima. We've been showing you guys a lot of street food, a lot of traditional meals but today we're bringing you into the home to show you what a Peruvian breakfast looks like. And that is what I got right here. Today we are sampling two traditional breakfasts. We're going to be having Tamales (which is what you see over here) and we're also having something called Pan Con ChicharrÃ³n, so let's just dig in because I'm starving. This is my favourite food item Tamale. And it is time for the big unveil. So here we have the dish and I am so excited to dig in. So in case you're not too familiar with Tamales it is actually a starchy corn dough which is wrapped in a plantain leaf and then it is either steamed or boiled. You can get it with different kinds of meats so we ordered chicken and pork today and by the looks of it this is the chicken and it also has got some black olives in there. So I'm going to dig right in. Alright, I'm zooming right in for the food money shot here. This is breaking apart, man. It is still warm from the market. This is amazing. Freshly made. Your Uncle just picked that up didn't he? Hurray, for Coco! And the thing is I love these so much that I can finish a whole one by myself. Sometimes they get even bigger ones that are like a size like a big block or a big square. I can just devour that. I know, I've seen you do it. There is the olive. Let's get a close up shot of that. Okay, or not. Next bite can we get a little close up of your fork. Ooh, la lah. So yeah, this is a really nice savory and starchy dish. It is a really nice way to start the day because it is a very hearty breakfast, it fills you up for the rest of the day and it just tastes so good. Man, I'm going to have one more bite. I'll be lucky if I get one bite of that. Yeah. It's all mine. Mmmm. You going to have one more bite for the fans? I'm good. Hahaha. So Sam what are you having for breakfast today? For my Peruvian breakfast, I am having Pan Con Chicharron. And if that is not a handful enough of a word this looks like a pretty big sandwich. Look at what we've got here. So, I'm going to open it up for you guys here. What it appears to have is onions and a generous portion on the other side of the patty of sweet potatoes which are called Kamote. And I have to say about the sweet potatoes here in Peru, they are especially sweet and good quality. Mmm. And what about the meat? So the meat is pork and it is called ChicharrÃ³n because it is really nice and crispy. Ooh, lah lah. It sounds like the perfect sandwich to me. Alright, my favorite part of every food video - the first bite. Mmmm, yeah. That meat is amazing and when you pair it with the sweet potato that is an all-time winning combo. I love this. I could eat this for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, whatever. Mmmm. And this looked too good so I wanted to try it as well because I'm hungry that way. Is that your way of basically kicking me off as a presenter. More or less, right? Mmmm. That is a winning combination. This may be my new favorite breakfast item actually. Wow! It just knocked off the other item, the Tamales? Give me a second to finish chewing. Alright, so what I like about this one is that you have the savoury pork - the Chicharron - then you've got the sweet potatoes but also the onions in the sandwich have been soaked in lemon so there is a nice sourness to it. So you have all of these flavours mixing together and it is just like a party in my mouth. And the quality of the bun is really good too. So yeah, you put those nice ingredients. That sour, sugary ingredients with a nice quality bun. It is so good. Oh man, I know. And that is supposed to be mine. So um, you're only getting one more bite. It better be a big one then. Make it worthwhile. That's what is left. We've had a very patient third member in this food video. Dog Maki. And I like to refer to this cute little dog as the goose of silly. It has so much energy and when we bring it to the table to give it a little bit - is it Chicharron? -he is going to be over the moon excited. Let's go get him. He's got quite the appetite. Let's go get him. Maki. Maki. Maki. Come on. Oh, you cute little pouch poo. Sam, only one piece. One more. You don't want to make him sick. He's got really good catching abilities. Watch this. Look at that. No, Maki this one is mine. Is he in his frantic poodle mode? No, baby. You can't sorry. No, baby. You can't have any. It is not good for you. It's a tough life isn't it Maki? It's a tough life. It's a tough life. What do we have here? Well, it's time for another taste test. And the dog Maki seems rather interested. So I've got a bit of a raspy voice going on but that is not going to stop me from trying some sweets. So today for our taste test we've having some called King Kong. I've never had this before but just by reading the box it looks like it is cookies filled with Manjar de blanco which is like that brown milk caramel, some kind of pineapple marmalade or pineapple sweet and then peanuts. So, a massive dessert. I think that is how it gets the name King Kong. And we're going to be trying it. And the dog Maki also wants some. You want some too Maki? You want some too? So, I'm sure you can buy this homemade but we've got the packaged variety over here. Someone in the family already dug in. But this is basically what it looks like. And we've got someone else in the family who wants some more. Yes, a big block of cake. That is what it looks like. That is massive. Let's hope we can get some before the dog takes it all. No, Maki. Alright, and this is a slice of the cake. And I have to say it is massive. Let's get a closeup. Absolutely, massive. That is why we couldn't just take it out of the box and start gnawing on it. It was just like a big brick. So here is my slice of the brick. And you can see all of the different layers here. If you take a really good close-up look. So it looks like we have three different layers. So how do I even attempt this? I'm just going to take maybe one big bite. Woah. Or the dog beats you to it. Wow. There is a lot of competing flavors going on all at once. I do taste the pineapple, I taste something that is a little bit like date sugar or cane sugar and also something that is a little bit like dulce de leche too. Oh, you poor baby. You want some. Well, too bad. Just wait. Owe. This is a seriously delicious treat and I think that the dog is going to gnaw my arm off. Alright, now it is my turn. Let's see. Okay, so that was the pineapple side. Yes, Maki. Yes. Yes, it smells good. Doesn't it? Okay, middle part. Okay. I think I like the middle filling a little better - Manjarblanco. Now let's see - the third one. I have no idea what the dark one is. It said something about peanuts but it doesn't look like peanuts to me but let's read the box again. So yeah, according to the box the darker one should be peanut because here we've got the pineapple, then we've got the manjarblanco and all that is left is the mani. So, yes. Mysterious. So for you how does that compare to some of the other Peruvian desserts we've been having? Um, well honestly I think I would probably like this a lot better if it were fresh and homemade. And without a dog trying to devour it. Maki, Maki could probably eat it regardless even if it were stale, wouldn't you baby? You'd eat anything wouldn't you? You'd eat anything. But yeah, the cookie is a little harder so I'm not sure if that is because it is prepackaged or if that is just the way it is made. Whether it is supposed to be a harder crumbly cookie. Um, but yeah I mean it is sweet. If you have a sweet tooth you'll probably enjoy it. It is not my favorite but it is not bad either, so maybe try some King Kong when you're in Peru. Okay baby, we'll give you a little piece. Let's give you a tiny one. Okay, let's just give you a crumb Maki. That is all I can break off. Oh, Maki approves. Yes. Oh, no! He's got lipstick on his face now. Hahaha! Oh, poor dog. Alright, for today's food video this is going to be one of the more exotic things we've tried in Peru - Guinea Pig. Locally it is known as Cuy. And we've been showing you a lot of desserts and other types of things but this is something that is widely eaten in Peru and so when you're in a different country and a different culture my strategy is always just to immerse myself and try everything new that I possibly can. So, with that in mind, I am going to be trying Guinea Pig in the form of a pizza slice if you can believe it or not. So here is the big unveil. I'll hold that up here. And as you can see this is a pretty minimalistic thin sliced pizza except for the massive Guinea pig meatballs. Alright, it is time to dig right in. It is time for the first bite and I'm going for a slice of the meatball. Definitely one of the more interesting pizza's I've ever had before. Usually when I'm even on a meat lover pizza there isn't pieces of meat this big, so it is going to take me a second to chew it. You know what that is pretty good. I can tell that this meat has been seasoned a lot. It tastes a little bit like an Italian sausage. But it also has a very game-y flavor which reminds me a little bit of a wild rabbit. For example. Let's get another piece of the Cuy. Does it have any bones? It doesn't, no. But it is very meaty. And what I mean by that is chewy. So, it's not the kind of thing. It's not the kind of pizza slice you can just devour when you're actually taking a bite out of the Guinea Pig. You've got to chew it really slowly. So yeah, that isn't bad. I would say it is a bit of an acquired taste. I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again. But I've definitely had worse pizza than this. So this isn't too bad at all. So a little bit more information about eating Guinea Pigs in Peru. It is traditional Andean food. Typically, the Guinea Pig, the Cuy, is skewered on a spit. And when it is served on a plate typically it is its entire body. It has its head still intact. Well, hello there! I am back with my raspy voice and it is getting a little bit scary. But we're running out of time here in Peru. It's actually our last day here in Lima. So we've decided to do one more taste test. And we're going to be trying three different desserts that were actually recommended by you our YouTube viewers. So let's get started! Right, so time for the big unveil. So first up we're trying something called Mazamorra Morada. So as you can see it is a deep purple in color. And this is like a pudding or a really thick jello almost. And it is made from purple corn. It is a dessert. You can eat it hot or you can eat it cold. And it is actually a popular dish during the month of October because that is when they celebrate the Lord of Miracles. And everyone dresses in purple and they also eat purple dessert. Okay. So I'm not really sure how much of this I'm actually going to be able to taste because I'm highly medicated right now. But let's see. Okay. It has like a puree consistency. A little clumpy. Not overly sweet and I wouldn't say it tastes like corn because a lot of sugar has been added to this. But it is pleasant. I do like it. That is the verdict. Yeah, I think it is probably a lot nicer when it is warm. Like when they've just finished cooking it on the pot and it is still steaming. But it is nice. I think you can still eat it cold in the summertime. I don't mind it. Alright, my turn. Yeah, that's not bad. It's really unique, isn't it? It's sort of like the Chicha Morada a little bit. It kind of reminds me of that. The purple corn drink we've been having. Um, yeah it is a smooth pudding. So here in Peru they like to mix the Mazamorra Morada, the purple thing we just had with Arroz Con Leche which is a rice pudding. That looks so good. We were going to try that combination right now. My Mom makes an awesome rice pudding. Yeah. Yeah. So I'll add a bit of that. And now let's take some of the purple stuff. Okay, now I'm not sure if you're supposed to mix it together or just combine the two flavours in one spoon full. Oh man, there is like dog hair here. Jeez! Ewww! Everywhere! Maki attack yet again. It is everywhere. Man. Okay, so here we go. Well honestly, I think rice should be savoury. When I eat rice I always like it be salty and full of spices. So I don't love it as a dessert. So I can't say I'm a huge fan of this. I'm going to have another bite. Would you prefer it on its own? Like the first dessert on its own? Probably. It's alright. Why don't you give it a try and you tell us what you think? Alright, I'm going to in for the mix here. I am mixing it up. I have no idea if I'm supposed to be doing that or not. Okay, and this is what it looks like when it is all mixed up. I'm a huge fan of rice pudding. So for me that is a definite enhancement. That is like taking the first one and upgrading it by at least 50%. Okay, and last but not least we picked up a third dessert item at the supermarket. And this is called PurÃ© De Kamote and it is a puree made from sweet potato. That almost looks like a butterscotch pudding. I bet that is going to be good. Alright. Let's see. It looks like baby food. I wonder if parents buy it for their children. Yucky? Oh, that is too much like baby food? How do you even know what baby food tastes like? When was the last time you tried baby food? It is not exclusively sweet or savory. So it is weird. Is it a pudding? Is it supposed to be eaten as a side order with your main dish. But it was in the dessert section. That is the thing. I was expecting it to be sweeter. I can tell by your micro bites you're not exactly loving it. I'm not a huge fan but I'll let you give it a try next. You're right, that is not amazing stuff. To be perfectly honest, I have no idea what you would use that for. Like it is not sweet or tasty enough to be a dessert. I'm not sure how you would pair that with a main meal. I'm wondering if maybe we were supposed to mix it with rice pudding. You know what? Maybe we bought baby food by accident. You never know? You never know? Right. You just never know. Alright, so that wraps up our last taste test in Peru. We're heading back to Canada. It is hard to believe our 3.5 weeks here is already over. And the verdict for this. Well I really liked these two but the Kamote was a thumbs down. So we are in the kitchen today and we are going to be showing you our favorite Peruvian cocktail. This is something we've been drinking every single week since we got here and it is Pisco Sour. That National drink. Audrey's Uncle Coco has been making these for us at night and now we're going to attempt to make them ourselves. So of course, the main ingredient of this is Pisco itself. And Pisco is a hard alcohol that is made from distilled grapes. It has 45% alcohol content which is pretty high. So I've been told that the recipe for Pisco Sour is three, two, one. So that would be three shots of Pisco, two shots of the syrup and one shot of lime juice. And aside from that we're also going to be adding one egg white to create the foam and also topping it off with a little bit of bitter. And I know some people like to serve it without the ice but we're going to be adding some ice because that is the way my family does it. So, that is how we roll. Alright, I think we're done. It is time to pour ourselves a glass. Nice and frothy. Okay, so the final touch is adding a few drops of bitter. Let's do three. Oh my, a little too much in that one. I have to say those turned out pretty well. I am now ready to drink my creation. That turned out really nice. It burns a little as it goes down. But yeah, it is a nice mix of sourness because of the lemon. It is also sweet because of the syrup we've added. A little bit of bitter on top. And it is super frothy with the egg whites. Nice and frothy. Yes. Alright, I've been waiting for this for a while now. You know what, that's actually not that bad. We don't make mixed drinks very often but we did a reasonably decent job on this one. I find this to be a very refreshing drink. This is the kind of thing that I love to have on a hot day. It is also a very social drink which you can share with others. So that is it from our time in Lima, Peru. Salut!",False,20151115 - Peruvian Cuisine∩╝Ü Lima Food Guide.en.srt

From Braai to Biltong we sampled a lot of new things for the first time. Aside from possibly Argentina, I can't think of a country that does better barbecue and wine. However, I learned my lesson that barbecue is merely a sauce and grilled meat to perfection is what you can Braai. Come join us as we eat and drink our way around South Africa. Right now we're at Wild Farm in Wilderness and we're waiting for one of my favorite things. It's called Braai. It's South African barbecue and it is absolutely phenomenal. So in the background we've got our lovely little log cabin. I'm drying out a towel right now. But anyways that is besides the point. The team here at the hostel is now working on the barbecue. They're stoking the fire so we are going to show you the whole process. Let's go cook some Braai. And Audrey has made a new best friend. Who is this? It's Kika. Is it playtime or nap time? It looks like nap time. You want to take this one home in your backpack? Yes. She would fit nicely. Not a bad little view from over here huh? What are you drinking? Um, apple cider. Alright, we've got the grill master here and he's going to tell us what makes Braai much better than barbecue. Well, firstly, barbecue is a sauce. Hahahaha. But the difference with a South African Braai is the fact that we use real wood instead of charcoal. And it gives a different flavor to the meat. And that is a big thing. Excuse me. What have we got here? We've got some good chicken. Look at that. This is sausage as well. That looks so good. But first. So underneath the Braai that is where you have the meat that is already done and the cheesy mushroom bread. Here is the finished product. Look at that. Wow! So that is the bread? Yep. It's the cheesy mushroom bread. Show us that. Woah. It is almost like a sandwich. A hot sandwich. That's for me. Alright, we are checking out your plate. What do we got over here? So it is all dished up. My first traditional Braai. We've got some chicken, some sausage and some meat. So I am ready to dig in. What else do we have aside from that? Well, there is salad and potatoes on the side and some feta cheese. But who is focusing on that. Okay, first bite. Who cares about that stuff. Mmmm. That is wonderful. You did a great job. Cool, man. Yeah, seriously. Alright, stop filming me and enjoy your food man. Hahahaha. Alright, I'm trying the sausage. That is amazing. South African Braai sausage is better than anything else I've ever tried. Well Hello from South Africa. We just finished raiding a supermarket where we picked up as many South African snacks as we could. We grabbed chips, chocolate bars, soda drinks and we're going to try them all for you. So this is our South African taste test. So over here I've got myself Nik Naks. It's a maize snack and I think the packaging looks great. Have a look in the bag. Those kind of look like cheesies. They look like cheese puffs and they taste like cheese puffs. It's very airy and crunchy. It's a nice light snack. Good snack for the road. I'm giving it the thumbs up. Road tripping snack. I'm trying here the Chocolate Log. And I have a feeling, oh yeah, it is a marshmallow on a crispy wafer. I wonder if it is going to taste a bit like a wagon wheel or a krembo. Show us the bar. What does it look like? Yeah, we've got the crunchy part on the bottom and we've got the marshmallow in the middle. That is a really really good bar. Mmm. Yum. So this one looks interesting. It is really similar to the Mars bars that we have in North America. Even the packaging and the color on the packaging is quite similar. But this is called Now. Eat it now! Now! Chocolate now! I wonder if it will be a similar filling. It looks similar too. It's got caramel and how do you call it, nougat? Chocolate. Yeah, you know what, this to me tastes just like a Mars Bar. Just different name, that is all it is. Yeah, good stuff. Being the cat lover that I am when we were divvying up the snacks we kind of had an almost like a draft. Like a lottery. I chose the Black Cat bar. So it is a peanut snack packed with peanut power apparently. Let's try that out. It looks like it has got some kind of like a toffee or a something sticky and sweet keeping it together. Oh gosh, I'm going to break my tooth. It is super crunchy. Yeah, really really sweet. And it is kind of like, I don't know, like a honey or a caramel that is hardened. Really crunchy, packed with peanuts, pretty much delicious. Okay, I'm not sure what this one is called but I think Beacon is the brand and Whippy is the name. And it says mmm Mallows. I think it is supposed to be like marshmallows or something. Mallows. Mallows. Soft strawberry flavored mallow smothered in chocolate and coconut. We call it marshmallow back in Canada but we'll go with mallows. Let's see. Lekker. So it is like a pink and white marshmallow inside. Nice and spongy. It doesn't really have a strong strawberry flavor which is what I was expecting because of the pink packaging. It is just like a sweet fluffy marshmallow inside. It's good. I like it. Wonder Bar. And if I remember correctly we have something by the same name in Canada but I'm not entirely sure. There is definitely a wonder something kind of chocolate bar. But this appears to be totally different. I have a feeling this is mint chocolate. It is mint flavored apparently. And it appears to be really small. Some kind of an ant on me. Okay. So let's try that. Can you see the green. Yeah, kind of. Oh, Wow. That is a really unique mint chocolate bar. It's like nothing I've really had before. It's got a crunchiness to it. Almost like a cookie flavor. Wow. The mint is really hitting me strong. The first time you have a bite you don't really taste it that much. But as you're chewing it, a really strong mint flavor. It is kind of like an after eight? Stronger mint flavor than that. I like it even more. Next up, we have something called Diddle Daddle by Jumping Jack. Diddle Daddles. That sounds like something like a taddle. Tiddle taddle. Don't diddle daddle. Okay, so it looks like caramelized popcorn. So it is sweet popcorn. I think you would call this kettle corn in Canada, right? Yeah, I think. Sweet kettle corn. Sweet popcorn. Caramelized. It doesn't have a buttery flavor. It is just strictly caramel. Perfect for watching a movie, huh? Diddle Daddle. Don't diddle daddle. Or do diddle daddle. So I've got a TV bar. Shall I assume you're supposed to eat this while watching TV. Who knows? So, as it says here, tropical coconut, crunchy rice puffs and smooth white chocolate. Sounds pretty good to me. Let's see the white chocolate coating here. Okay, you know what? That's kind of like something in between a granola bar and a chocolate bar. Would you say it is healthy? No, it's got a lot of sugar for sure. It's good though. You can definitely taste that coconut. Now I'm moving on to the Niki cluster coconut clustered coated in smooth milk chocolate. Okay. Let's see what this is all about. I wonder if it is going to taste like a Bounty Bar. The one we have back home. Okay, so it is coated in chocolate. Oh, it is quite chocolate-y inside. I'm going to zoom in on that. It does taste a bit like coconut but I was expecting like white shredded coconut in the middle. And it is more like coconut that has been coated in chocolate. It's nice. Mmmm. I've been saving this one for near the end. I love coconut chocolate bars. They're some of my favorite. And I really like Bounty Bars and I really like Ritter Sport coconut flavor from Germany, so lets see if this Niki bar lives up to that. Oh yeah, it's amazing. Wow! Look at all of that coconut goodness in the middle here. That is amazing. That deserves another big bite even though I'm already full. Mmmm. Delicious! Okay, so next we have mini Eet Sum Mor biscuits. Eat some more of that! Come on, eat some more. I'm expecting something like short bread cookies. Oh, they're quite small. Show us one. I'll just pop one in my mouth. These are what they look like. They're tiny. Little squares. Woah! We have birds. Sam, it's like a miniature short bread cookie not overly sweet. It would go nice with a cup of tea. Are you going to eat some more? No, I'm going to move on to my next snack. Are you sure? Okay, I'm having a Lion King moment over here. These are Simba chips. Simba! What flavor? Smoked beef flavored potato chips that roars with flavour. Simba. Okay. Yeah, it is like a beef flavored chip. I don't think I've ever had anything like this before. It tastes like meat. In chip form. Okay, now the funny story about this one here. It's called Iron Brew is that they have something in Scotland that is called the same thing. But it is spelled in Scotland Irn. So we called it Urn Bru. We totally messed up. It is supposed to be called Iron Bru. Here it is spelled with a vowel, with an O so no mistakes this time. Iron Brew. This is the first time to try this. I have no idea what it tastes like. I don't think it is going to taste like the one from Scotland because that is an orange color. It is definitely different. Wow! I don't even really know how to describe it. It has a different cola flavor than anything I've ever tried before. What does it say on the bottle? What is the description? Well, it says South Africa's favorite. Um, I'll have to look to the ingredients here. Carbonated water, sugar, caramel flavor, citric acid. Yeah, it's got, it does have a bit of a caramel flavor. It's um, it's unique. That's all I can say. Another chocolate bar up ahead. This one is Beacon. Forest fruit and nut chocolate. Forest fruit, wow. It kind of reminds me of the Cadbury bars you'd get back home. The fruit and nut bars, yeah. I wonder if it is going to be similar. I think so. Dun, dah, dah, dun. It's hard chocolate. Yeah, nutty. Fruity? Yeah, it's milk chocolate with fruits, nuts. A very familiar flavor. Nothing out of the ordinary. It's good. Alright, we've done a whole other video dedicated to Biltong but this here is a kind we didn't try. Hello, Kika. She wants some snacks. You came just at the right time. You wanted the meat snacks. So this is Kudu. It is a kind of game flavor. Game meat. So let's open that up. A bite for me. That's really good meat. A bite for Kika. She's eating it off of my leg. Here, one more bite for Kika. Come on Kika. Yum, yum. That's really good. It does have that game-y kind of flavor. And it is really rich. Really high quality and you can tell there is not a lot of fat in this. So, I know we can get Cadbury all around the world but this flavor I have never seen before. What is it? Show us. We have marvelous creations and this is cookie gummy crunch. Very colorful packaging. We've got a party going on over there. Oh, yeah. Let's open this monster chocolate bar. It's huge, it must be like well over 100 grams. Maybe 200. Here, so I'm going to break a piece in half. Oh, you can see some of the cookie pieces. Okay, hold it still. Oh, you can, wow. Let's see. Yeah, so it's got cookie chunks and some blue crumbly stuff. Crunchy stuff. I couldn't tell you what candy the blue stuff is. It is just crunchy, hard candy. But the chocolate is good. The milk chocolate is good quality. Okay, I'm really excited about this product. I think it is like Ginger Beer flavored mints. And that seems like a very niche king of unique product. I can't wait to try it. Yep, those are mints. I don't think you're going to like these. I'm still finishing my jerky. Alright, ready to try these. Wow! These are strong. I'm loving this. I love strong ginger beer flavor but I have a feeling that unless you've grown up drinking ginger beer 95% of people who haven't probably wouldn't like this. This is delicious to me but this is not something that I would bring home for as a gift for friends and family. Let's say that. Next up, we have the nut basket. Tasty South African snacks and this one is roasted giant peanuts Peri Peri. And apparently peri peri is just a spice. Like a mix of different spices. I think it is supposed to be quite spicy. Hot. Let's see abot that. So this is what they look like. It's not overly spicy yet. I'm waiting for the burn to kick in. Feel the burn? I mean, it's spicy. It's got some flavor but it is not overly spicy that you're like having to chug a glass of milk. Yeah, Peri Peri peanuts. So, another thing we picked up in the supermarket: Romany Creams. Classic choc. And it says are you South Africa's biggest bakers fan? Let's find out if I am. Oh, I like that easy tear away. Nice. Use those big muscles of yours. Muscles. Okay, they are just loose. They're biscuits. So, chocolate biscuit with chocolate filing. It's a nice crunchy cookie. It would be really nice for dunking in your coffee or your tea. Yeah, chocolate. Okay, so next I'm trying something called Sparberry soft drink. Spar letta, I'm not sure if that is the brand. I'm going to assume so since the supermarket was called Spar. So Sparberry drink here we go. Oh, it is pink. Splashed it on my finger. I just poured it all over myself. I'm going to say cherry. I think it is cherry flavoured. I think it is strawberry flavored. Yeah, look. It says. Oh, no it doesn't. It could be either cherry or strawberry. I'm not sure. My puppy friend is here. Kika. Kika is here. Come Kika. Let her say hello now that I'm filming. Come. This is Kika. Kika lives here in Wilderness. And she is a cute puppy and she has been sleeping on my lap and being very very sweet these past few days. Haven't you? Are you cute Kika? Are you cute? Kika. Maybe she wants some snacks. Maybe. You arrived just at the right time. Didn't you? Alright, I've been saving this for the end because I'm thirsty after trying all that chocolate and savory snacks. This is Stoney Ginger Beer. I love ginger beer. The best ginger beer I have ever had has been in Australia. It's a lot stronger than the stuff you can get in Canada. So let's so how this Stoney stuff compares. Wow, that is pretty strong. Yeah, that is some of the best ginger beer I've ever had. I can't wait to finish that off. So, ciao from South Africa. This is Sam, Audrey and Kika signing off from Wilderness. Hi, pup. Say, bye. So we're closing off with Biltong in my hand and Kika. Come on Kika. Come, on, come get some. Come on. Come here. Here you go. So we have a fun day planned today. We're actually doing a wine tour around Stellenbosch so we're just going to be driving through the countryside sipping on wine. Let's get started. And eating cheese. So we're pairing some white wines with cheese. I don't know which one I'm more excited about. I think maybe the cheese. And this is my favorite cheese so far. It is called White Rock with cranberry. It tastes a little bit like cheesecake. The last sweet red wine we tried tasted a little bit like Christmas cake. It was delicious. Good to the last drop. So we just finished our first wine tasting here at Fairview. We each tried six different wines with cheese. I think we're feeling pretty happy right now aren't we? It is eleven fourteen in the morning right now and I'm already well greased. So we've now arrived at our second vineyard of the day. This one is called Moroti and it has more of a rustic family feel. So let's go check that one out. So this particular vineyard has a lot of character. It has a specially rustic feel. And it has just been cool touring around here. Given some of the areas what appear to be permanent cobwebs. It is pretty amazing. So this is our third vineyard and this particular red wine is straight from the barrel. Oh, take a sip. It's good. And for dessert we are what? Roasting marshmallows. Over an open fire. We're just missing the chocolate and graham crackers. Roasted to perfection. It's hot. Is it good? Delicious? Alright, I get the next one. And here is how I like mine. Nice and crispy all over. That's a mouth full. Alright, so we just finished a delicious braai lunch and we're feeling quite stuffed. But the tour isn't over. We still have two more vineyards to visit and apparently there is Biltong and chocolate on the menu. So I am looking forward to that. They're going to be carrying us away on wheel barrels by the time we're finished. So we are now at our forth vineyard. Everyone is wearing hats. I'm not sure why but we're going to go drink some wine in our fancy hats. We've moved on from cheese to lunch. And now we've got chocolate. And over here I've got a chili chocolate so apparently you don't taste it too much when you're chewing it but when it goes down. When you're swallowing it that is when you really feel the burn. So let's see if that is true. I don't taste it so much now. Maybe take a sip of wine and see what happens. Yeah, as soon as you swallow it you feel the burn. It is not too overpowering but it is. It's got some kick to it for sure. Time for some wine. Do you want neck scratches? You're sweet aren't you? Why are you behind a gate? Huh? You're not dangerous. Are you a guard dog? Are you a guard dog? Those are nice aren't they? Oh, you're getting a puppy massage. Puppy massage. So we have now arrived at our fifth and final winery of the day. To be honest they're all starting to blend together because we've been drinking way too much wine but there is still a little room for a few more glasses so let's go in and sample some more. Alright, so we've had cheese and we've had chocolate with our wine and now it is time for Biltong. Which is a type of South African jerky. This is awesome, high quality, fresh Biltong. Final impressions is that was a fantastic tour. It is actually our very last day in South Africa and I couldn't think of a more relaxing way to finish things off. The wine was fantastic. All of the food was really good. We had some excellent cheeses, chocolate and Biltong and we had a huge feast for lunch, so what a great way to wrap things up and that is it for us in South Africa. Okay, so a new country, a new taste test. We are in South Africa right now and you can't come to this country and not try Biltong. So that is what I have right here in this brown paper bag. So Biltong is a dried cured meat similar to beef jerky and this is what it looks like. So we got ourselves some beef biltong but apparently you can get different kinds of meats. Like game meat or ostrich. This is cow. And it is quite hard and chewy but it makes a really nice snack, so let's say you're riding the bus or going on a really long trip it is kind of nice to just have a bag full and be munching away. That's what we have been doing for the past few days. So for me Biltong is kind of like premium jerky. And there is three key differences. First off, it is sliced a lot thicker. Secondly, they use vinegar in the curing process along with salt and pepper. Which is a little bit different from regular jerky which doesn't have any vinegar whatsoever. And the third key difference is Biltong is not smoked whereas jerky is. Okay, so the purchasing process? What was awesome is that we went into a kind of like what would be considered a deli that specialized in Biltong. And when we went in there was all of these different kinds of dried meat hanging up in different sections. There was one that was game meat, there was one that was regular, there was a premium kind. I can't remember but there was a forth kind as well. And anyways, what you would do is pick this meat off of a hook and bring it over to these ladies who would then put it through a grinder and it would go into this bag like that. So it was a really cool to be right there involved in the process. And it just made it a lot more special. And the other thing that I really noticed that was a big difference is that the quality of the actual meat itself is a lot better than what comes from say packaged pre-packed stuff you would find in a store. So the word Biltong. What does it mean? I actually had to look this up but now I can tell you. So 'Bil' apparently comes from the Dutch word for rump and 'Tong' means strip or tongue. But contrary to popular belief Biltong is not made from bull's tongue, so don't be afraid to try it because of that. What have you got in your hand over there? Okay, and last but not least we have something called Cabanossi which kind of looks like a dried pepperoni stick. We also picked this up at the same store we got the Biltong. So I'm going to try that. Yeah, so it is kind of like a greasy salami stick. Again, chewy, salty, flavorful. I think it makes a great snack. Which one do you like better? Or do you like them both? I do like them both but this reminds me of salami or like a pepperoni stick so it is something I am familiar with. So I quite enjoy the flavor. One more bite. So when you're visiting South Africa, unless of course you're a vegetarian, be sure to try Biltong. I swear it is pretty much addicting. I can't seem to stop myself over here.",False,20151031 - South African Cuisine∩╝Ü An Introduction to South African Food Guide.en.srt

Peruvian cuisine, a mix of coastal, jungle and Andean delights, pleased my ever discerning taste-buds as a gallivanted around the city trying all kinds of different Peruvian foods. Being based in Miraflores meant that I had access to some of the best restaurants in all of Lima along with coastal views of the Pacific ocean and many green spaces to explore. The old colonial heart of Lima Central offered many fascinating architectural wonders to check out including Plaza de Armas, Plaza San Martín and the Monastery of San Francisco. The following is a compete Lima city guide featuring the top attractions worth visiting and Peruvian foods worth trying. So first full day in Lima. We got in last night at like 2am and we got some rest, so this morning we are out exploring. We're actually staying in the neighborhood of Miraflores so we're just going for a walk and we're going to show you some of the parks, the beach and it is so nice to be getting some sunshine guys. After that brutal Canadian winter this is bliss. Now talk about a change. I'm actually wearing shorts and t-shirts for the first time in 2015. Oooh, show us the outfit. Woo Hoo! So we're noticing some amazing paragliding. These paragliders are just going right out over these tall buildings and then going right out over the ocean. It looks fantastic. Neither of us have done paragliding so far in our lives but we may just be tempted to give it a shot. So right now we are visiting Larcomar which is like a shopping center that sits right over the cliff overlooking the sea. It's a pretty good location. And then our camera battery died because we forgot to charge it, so that is all we can show you today. But we will be exploring more of the neighborhood in the days to come, so stay posted for that. Coming in live from Parque Kennedy this is Gaucho Gringo Samuel. And before we start our tour of showing you all around Lima we're going to explore this park which is nearby our house. Meow. Meow. Meow. So this afternoon we're taking a tour with Mirabus and it is basically a bus tour around the city. It is not hop on, hop off style which means we won't get to you know get off and explore the places we're interested in. But we do get an overview of the city and right now we are visiting a beautiful Convent and Monastery. Considering how many food videos we've been making since we've been in Lima it is kind of crazy we haven't gone out to explore and check out the city. Part of that is because of course we've been doing our teaching practicum and also we've been visiting family. But the other part is we've been eating so much and taking too many Siestas. So we've finally outside and we're excited to show you around Lima. It is ridiculously hot and humid out here, so I'm trying my best to cool off with a local frozen popsicle here MaracuyÃ¡. And it is sweet and a little bit sour and tangy. Eating ice cream in church, I'm pretty sure that is not allowed. What can I say, I'm a bad boy. So it is lunchtime here in Lima and today we are at a local restaurant in Miraflores. It is called El Punto Azul and we are going to be trying the Peruvian national dish Ceviche. And judging by how packed this place is I have really high expectations. We had to come and sit up on the second floor. Our food has arrived. I couldn't be more excited. What do we have? Yeah. That was certainly worth the wait. So right now we have Ceviche over here and it comes with onions, sweet potatoes and also giant yellow corn. And look over to this side and we have something called Causa. Which is made with yellow sweet potato and there is some kind of seafood in the middle. You know what - that almost looks too cute to eat. It is shaped just like a fish. So the big question. What is Ceviche? It is actually a seafood dish. It is raw fish and it is cured with lemon juice and it is also served with a few spices and some onions. So I'm taking my first bite. Mmmm. That is so good. I think it is better than sushi honestly. That is amazing. Second bite. Nice and lemony citrusy. So good. And now I usually have to tell you this but please leave some for me too. So for my first bite I'm going to try mine with some aji. Oh, go easy on that. How is it? It's just so amazing. For me it is like enhanced Sashimi. Just all of the preparation they put into that sour sauce is just so good. One thing I've absolutely been loving since we've come to Lima is this giant sized corn. These kernels are massive. Check it out. Those are big. Okay, so our next dish is Causa. Let's dig in. I almost feel guilty eating this it is so beautifully presented. Look at that. Sorry, little fish. Sorry. That is seriously good. I can taste a lot of different ingredients there. So the big mystery over here is we're trying to decide what is actually in this dish. Okay. And what do you think? So Causa, it is made with yellow mashed potatoes. I asked for the one that comes with seafood and it also looks like it has some avocado and mayonnaise. So it is really tasty. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And for our drink we're having something that is called Chicha Morada. And it is a juice made from purple corn. Very tasty. Highly recommended. This is the best I've ever had. Like they've put some extra spices and ingredients. It has got a real kick to it. I don't know what is in it but. It is really sweet and really refreshing. Especially on a hot day like today. Well now that we've finished all of the fish we're left with nothing but lemon juice. But the good news it tastes delicious. It's amazing. You know what it kind of tastes a bit like Tom Yum. Tom Yum soup from Thailand. This sauce down here. I have no idea what we were thinking ordering a third plate of food. Like this is just ridiculous. We're already full. What have we got? I think we went a little overboard. This is basically breaded and deep-fried seafood, so there is a little mix of everything. We have some pieces of fish. Some shrimp. And other things that I just don't recognize so we'll have to go for it. Take a bite and taste it I guess. And what are those? They look like giant potato wedges? Well, this is called Yucca. And it is kind of like a root or a potato. It is very fiberous and you eat it like French Fries basically. This is a fried Yucca. It looks starchy. Yeah. I really like these. So someone still had room for dessert. Honestly, I don't know what the heck I was thinking. This is one of the biggest meals I've had in a long time. But when they brought that dessert tray over with all of those different postres I just could not contain myself. This looks amazing. We don't even know technically what it is called but it has got dulce de leche. It has got nuts and it has got chocolate, so it is going to be really good I'm sure. And a slight correction over here. That was coconut not nuts. Oh my gosh that is so good. So so decadent. I'm sure it has got a zillion calories. So total cost. That meal came to 118 Soles which would be roughly around forty dollars and that included drinks. We got three dishes and one dessert to share so it was a lot of food. We are beyond stuffed and everything was delicious. So today we are on a food mission. We are looking for a place called Manolo and we're going to be eating some Churros. Let's go eat. So getting there is half the journey. Now the other half is going to be eating it. And here we are - Manolo's! So we went all out here and got one of each. So this is the one with chocolate, vanilla and dulce de leche. Talk about a trio. I know. Just for me. So in case you've never tried Churro before it is just a deep-fried dough with like a hole in the middle so I guess you can fill it up with something really sweet and tasty. So the one I'm having right now has dulce de leche. Mmmm. Oh my gosh, that's warm and gooey and sweet. So do you think it is fresh out of the oven? Oh, it definitely is. Wow! Decisions, decisions, decisions. The decisions I have to make in life. Okay, I'll go with chocolate. Mmmmm. His eyes are closed. That's a good sign. You're totally right about it being freshly made. I can taste the warm gooeyness of that chocolate inside. You're not getting a bite of that. Last but not least, Vanilla! Mmmm. It is like a vanilla pudding or like the filling you get inside the Boston cream donuts. Mmmm. I still think I like this one better though - Dulce De Leche. It's my number one. So that was a very delicious snack and it wasn't very expensive at all. I lost my receipt but I think I paid somewhere near twelve Soles which would be around four dollars for those three very tasty, very sweet churros. Highly recommended. So seriously, it is probably a good idea that we're walking home right now. I honestly could have had about five more of those dulce de leche churros. And we've got more food videos coming soon. So we are taking part in Sam's favourite activity today. We are actually going shopping. So we are visiting a place called Mercado Indio which is like a local craft and artisans market, so we're just going to pick up souvenirs and see what we can find. So you can buy all sorts of things here. There is Alpaca sweaters, mittens, leg warmers. You can get little chess games of the Incas versus the Spaniards. You can get Coca candy, coca tea, jewelry. The possibilities are endless. You can seriously spend a few hours just browsing around. I think the cutest thing I've seen so far are the stuffed llamas. I might just bring one to cuddle back home on the plane. So someone has been a busy little shopper over here. What do we have to show? I guess I'll show you my purchases. So I bought a collection of cute little mirrors. Actually they've been triple and quadruple wrapped in paper. The big unveil. Okay, so I got a collection of three different mirrors. I think they're really cute. You can put them up on a wall. So yeah, I got some of those. I also got some Coca candy and some Coca tea. And we're going to shop a little bit more and see what we can find. Right? So I got Coca candy and Coca tea over here. And when I was visiting Machu Picchu five years ago this tea right here helped me to acclimatize to the altitude. So that concludes our afternoon of shopping. If you feel like checking out the market while you're in Lima it is located on Avenida Petit Thoars. You've got yourself a little friend over there? Hello. So we are back at Parque Kennedy yet again. You're probably wondering why we are here. We keep coming back. And the answer is because my husband Sam is a cat lover. And there are hundreds of cats here and he decided 'hey' it might be good idea to go pick up some cat food and come feed the cats. So today we're here to feed the kittens. I'm the embodiment of a cat lady. So we are back at our favourite park once again. This is Parque Kennedy and we are here for dessert. What else. So today we are going to be sampling something that is called TurrÃ³n. So part of reason we like coming here are all of the cats. There must be hundreds of them and they are so friendly. They just want to be scratched and petted. Look there is another one coming up right behind you. Oh, Hello. Hello, cat. Look at you. You're a sweet one. You're still a kitten. Oh, it is sitting on me. I've made a new friend. Hi, Cat. Hello, cat. So what have you got over here? Okay, so we ended up getting two different things. This is called Turrone. And over here, oh my goodness, it already got stuck to my leg. This giant thing over here is called Torreja. So they look kind of different but they are both actually made with the same ingredients. So all this is is deep-fried flower and then they drizzle honey over top. Sounds good enough to me? Yeah. Let's try it. The first bite. The first bite. Big moment here. Here we go. It looks sticky. I think you bit off a little more than you can chew there. This is interesting. It's getting stuck to my teeth. A little difficult to talk right now but the honey kind of has an orange flavor to it. And also it is a lot stickier than honey. I wonder if it is more of a marmalade. Kind of an orange marmalade. Do you think, maybe? Maybe. They told me honey but I don't know. No honey for the bunny. Mmmm. It is nice. Really crsipy. The dough itself is really not really very flavorful because I mean it is just flour but the honey that is what you can taste. The orange flavoured honey. Want to have some? Alright, it is my turn. Oh, you can take a bigger bite than that. I don't want to get all of that sticky stuff all over my face. We don't have any napkins out here. This probably looks more like French Fries with like ketchup drizzled all over them but in fact this is the second dessert we're going to be trying. And I've noticed since we've come to Lima that cakes and other things tend to have these little doughy bits. Crunchy doughy bits and so let's try it here. Like I don't see myself breaking it off with my hand. I'm just going to take a bite. Mmmm. That is good. You know what, I think I actually prefer this one to the big pizza shaped one I had. Similar flavour to the previous one. More or less the same thing. Just kind of slightly different. You know what? It kind of tastes like Fruit Loops. When you really chew on it for a while it is like really sugary Fruit Loops. Maybe that is why we like it so much. We grew up eating Fruit Loops. Fruit Loops guys. Fruit Loops. Peruvian Fruit Loops. So how much did today's dessert cost? Well, this was probably our cheapest street food / dessert that we've had since we've come to Peru. This one came to three Soles each. So that is a dollar for each of those delicious little snacks we had. So you know, if you're on a budget you can really load up on those. So we're just going to go for a little walk around the park and then we're going to head home for more food. Whal else. All we do is eat. Meow, meow, meow. Oh, look at that. Meow, meow, meow little kitty. You're a cute one aren't you. Oh, it is purring. I can feel it purring. Hi Kitty. Hi Kitty. So this afternoon we're at a place called Cremoladas Curich. Yep, got the name right and we're trying a kind of like icy cold dessert called Cremolada. And basically this is shaved ice, finely shaved ice and then it is topped with like a juice or a syrup that has like a tropical fruit flavor. So I've chosen Chicha Morada which is a purple corn. And Sam over here has chosen Lucuma. So we're going to being try these. Very local flavours. Oh, yeah. Very much so. Just mixing it around. Ice cold. Purple goodness. Ready for my first bite. This is purple corn. Mmmm. It tastes. It doesn't taste like corn. It tastes more like syrup. Purple syrup? I mean, like what would you call this back at home? It that like a kind of a slushie. A slushie! There you go. It's a slushie. So I'm having a purple corn slushie. Do you actually like it? So, so? Yeah, I mean it is ice. Flavored ice. It's okay. What can I say. So I've got something called lÃºcuma. And it is a local fruit which I've kind of fallen in love with since being in Peru. I mean you can't really describe what a fruit tastes like. A mango tastes like a mango, a peach tastes like a peach, and a lucuma tastes like a lucuma. So let's try it here. It is definitely sweet. It has that sweet tropical taste, so I can say that. This one seems really thick. I really like that. I have a feeling that mine is quite a bit thicker than yours. If you just look down at it here you can see that it is really thick. And you can really taste the fruit. It has definitely been sweeten but it is not overpowering. The fruit tastes really comes out so I'm actually really enjoying this right now. So it is nothing out of the ordinary but if you're in Lima on a really hot day this is definitely a very refreshing little slushie drink and in terms of costs. Those buses! In terms of costs it was five Soles and seventy cents which is less than two dollars. So not a bad deal. It is actually kind of getting chilly here so I'm cold eating this. I can't believe you're wearing a sweater. I'm wearing a t-shirt and shorts and I think this is perfect weather. So it is time to get back home before Audrey suffers from hypothermia. You know it is only like twenty-five degrees outside or something. Pish posh. It must be like eighteen and I'm freezing. So today we're going to be trying something called Alfajores. And this is something you can find throughout South America but it varies from country to country. So today we're having Peruvian Alfajores, so I'm going to open the box for a big reveal. And we've ordered a few different varieties. Wow, that looks awesome. We're very used to the Argentinian ones. Yeah. So what I've found particularly fascinating upon researching Alfajores is that it has Arabic origins. Then it made its way to Spain and now it has become immensely popular all over South America. Right, so this is the original which I'm going to be trying first. So it is basically two layers of a crumbly cookie. Let's zoom in on that. It has. You can zoom in. It has Manjar Blanco in the middle which is kind of like Dulce De Leche. It is a milk caramel. It is very sweet. And then it has like a white powdery sugar like icing sugar on top. It looks like a very generous amount of the dulce de leche. So this is a miniature version of the original Alfajor And it is what I'm trying first. Bite sized. Mmmm. Those are really nice. Up to standard? Mmmm. Nice and sugary. I think it would be nice for breakfast or for a little snack. Heck, maybe even dinner. I could see you eating that for dinner. You like your sweets. It is really nice. Alright, I'm also going to have the original one. And Alfajores kind of have a special place in my heart because during our wedding one of the things we made together as a family with Audrey's family is a huge batch of Alfajores which we ate of course and shared to our guests. So high expectations here and it does have some positive memories for me as well. Mmmm. One big bite. That's pretty good. Okay, so I'm interested in having this one next because it looks like chocolate. Let's hold that up. I'll zoom in. Oh yeah, it's got a chocolate layer. Okay. I'm trying to figure out what the filling is. Do you think it might be a dark fruit of some sort kind? Maybe like a plum. Not a plum but a date. A date filling? I think. No, it's chocolate-y. I think maybe they took the Manjar Blanco that we had for the other one and just added some chocolate and mixed it together. That would be my guess. And the cookie is chocolate. How does it compare to the original? I think I prefer the original personally. But this is nice as well, it is very tasty. And mysterious. So you got a little excited about the next one. Well, we were shooting a photo for our cover photo image of this video and I just got a little carried away. I was just planning on having my teeth on it but my brain. My subconscious brain took over and basically forced me to have a bite. Okay, first 'unofficial bite' over here. Yeah, that is really nice. It kinds of reminds me of the original Alfajor but the big difference here is that it has a crunchier exterior and if you see over on this side it is covered in what appears to be walnuts. How about the cookie dough? Does it also have nuts? Is it crunchy? Yeah, it is definitely crunchier than the original one which is more like a thin cookie. Alright, and then we are down to one. The one and only lonely one. So it is my turn. I believe this one has honey. That is what I was told. It looks sticky. It looks big. Oh, my gosh. Look at that. Okay, it is like a triple one. So triple layered Alfahor. Dude, it is spilling all over the place. Let's get a really good zoom in on that. Like that is just...woah. That is some serious, serious topping overflow there. And the taste? Well, that is not your average honey that is for sure. It's really thick and sticky. I've had it in a few other Peruvian desserts but I still don't know what it is made out of. Yeah, it has a stronger flavor than regular honey. Would you care to have a bite and tell me your thoughts? Maybe you can decipher the great mystery. Alright, the things that Audrey makes me do. The things I do in front of the camera. Oh my gosh. I'm just kidding. This is awesome. First bite here. Woah, I probably should have had a smaller bite. Yeah, that kind of reminds me of the Turron sauce honey. I have a feeling that maybe it mixed with some kind of date or possibly a kind of marmalade because yeah it just doesn't have a pure honey taste in my opinion. So we picked up this little goodie box from La Casa Del Alfajor which translates to the house of the Alfajor. And a yeah, it was a great little goodie box but I guess what sort of surprised me was that I ended up liking the original the most. How about you? Same. Loved the original. So I guess the take home message for today is don't mess with that awesome classic good flavor. Well, Hello there! So this afternoon we are at Parque Kennedy and we are here for some dessert. We've been eating like pigs all day long but there is still a bit of room left for a little something sweet, so we're going to try Picarones. Look at this - I already have a bee following me because of the honey. Isn't that amazing? Woah. And we thought about getting two orders. Haha. This will be plenty. Alright, so here we have our dessert. These are Picarones and they are like fried rings. Fried dough made with sweet potato and pumpkin and they have a sweet honey drizzled all over. And they're uniquely Peruvian cuisine. Oh, yes. So I'm just going to go for it and take a bite. Dig right in. Mmmmm. These are so fresh. Wow. Really fluffy and airy. Can you taste that honey? Oh, yeah. I sure can. And like they are so light I've already finished half of one. I understand why they give you five. You can just devour them in a few minutes. And we've got a guest who is interested as well. Hi, Kitty. Hello, Mr. Meowzers. So as I mentioned previously, this is a uniquely Peruvian dish. And as such there isn't an English equivalent. I suppose we could call it a Peruvian doughnut with honey. And so that is what we're going with. And this is my first bite. My first time to ever try this so I am really excited. I am sopping it up in honey. Woo Hoo!. Honey syrup. Let's try this. Oh my gosh. That is so good. You know what it reminds me of? It kind of reminds me of a oversaturated waffle with maple syrup or honey. It's like where you pour like three times as much as you actually need on the waffle and then you eat it. This is what it tastes like right here. Mmmm. I don't mess around when I eat food. What can I say. So this tasty dessert only cost us five Soles. That would be one sole for each donut that we've already eaten. That is pretty affordable actually with the exchange rate it would be about a dollar seventy-five and you do get a lot of food for that. So if you're looking to pair this sweet treat with a little beverage you can get something called Chicha which is a purple corn juice that goes perfectly with it. So there are five of these but only two of us. So who gets that third one? We split it down the middle Sam. Oh, I don't agree with that. Sleepy kitty. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. There are hundreds of cats in this park. Look here is another one. Meow. Meow. That was a delicious sweet treat and we're going to be back at this park again very soon to film some more street food. So we are back at Manolo, a restaurant that we've already been to a couple of times before. And the reason we are here is because the other day we were walking by and we saw that they have the biggest sandwich in the world. It is literally like this high and we're going to eat it. Oh, yes. Gracais. Whoops. You can keep filming. You are supposed to be talking. Gracias. One of the more embarrassing things to admit about our travels is that when we find a place we really really like we tend to come back again and again. And sometimes we feel a little bit guilty because we think we should be trying more spots but this Manolo place is so awesome we're back here yet again. This is for certain the biggest sandwich we've ever had. I think there might be six layers of bread here. Can you count that for us. Well, some are double layers so we actually have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 slices of bread. So the thing is how do we actually attack this sandwich. Like this thing is a behemoth. I'm starting in the middle where the avocado is located because that is what I like in a sandwich. So I don't think I've ever eaten a sandwich with a fork ana knife before but this is so massive and so messy that it seems like the only way. You're already spilling it. It's good. Oh, yeah. So I'm attempting to pick this sandwich up and maybe take a bite out of it. I don't even know how I'm going to attack it here. Um. Alright. I guess I'll just dig in. I've got it all over my face. But you know what. I went right for the egg and the avocado and that is amazing. Mmmm. So can you tell us what kind of ingredients we had in this monster sandwich? Well, it is a really eclectic blend. Like there is avocado, there is chicken breast, there is hotdog and I think I tasted a little bit of sweet potato. Then you've got all of the other kinds of regular things you'd find in a sandwich like tomatoes, lettuce and what not. But it is just a super loaded sandwich. If there is only one thing I could change I think I would go with whole grain bread instead of white. This piece of pie kind of reminds me of the Emerald City in the Wizard of Oz. I am wondering if Mr. Oz lives right on top here. And this is what I really came for - Lemon Meringue pie. It is the biggest slice I have ever seen in my entire life. And Lemon Meringue pie is my favorite so I'm pretty excited about this dish. Ho ho ho. I'm going to dig in. Oh, this is impossible. This is impossible. Got enough Meringue on your spoon? I think so. Ready. Oh my gosh. Pie-tastic? Fluffy. It's like biting into a sugar cloud. It's amazing. I'm just about to destroy the Wizard of Oz's home. He's way up top in his tower here. And I am very sorry, I just knocked it down. You're right, that is the lightest, fluffiest meringue of all -time which just dissolves as soon as you put it right into your mouth. It is amazing. So that was a rather affordable meal. The sandwich which was called the Pijama sandwich was 18 Soles. That is six dollars. And the lemon meringue pie was 12 Soles which worked out to be four dollars. So we ate a lot, we shared it and it was a really affordable meal. So this afternoon we are at the Love Park here in Lima and we're going to be doing yet another taste test. We're trying something that is called Tejas and Chocotejas. This is a dessert that comes from Ica and there are two different varieties. So first up we're going to be trying Tejas, which is a sweet. The exterior is covered in white sugar and then the inside has something inside called Manjar Blanco which is similar to Dulce de Leche which is like a milky caramel. It is really sweet. Some of them are filled with nuts, filled with different fruits, so we're going to try one. So I'm first up here with the pecan Tejas. You can see over here. Pecanas. I think according to you this should be white. It should be. Oh, Wow it is. It should be coated in white sugar. Wow! It's almost got that sliminess. Oh my gosh, I'm getting my hands all sticky. I think that is because I put it in the fridge. It really shouldn't be slimey. Okay. Oh my gosh. That is so sweet. Tasty. Show us what it looks like? It is just loaded with sugar. It's almost like eating icing with caramel inside and nuts of course. Pecans. Mmmm. I really like this. So next up I'm trying a Chocotejas, so unlike Sam's which was coated in a white sugar the chocotejas is actually coated in chocolate like the name suggests. And this one is lemon flavoured. And you know what? It is a different shape. Yeah, it is more like. It looks like more of a square. Let's take a bite. Mmmmmm. I was expecting it to be really sour because of the lemon but it is really not. It is still really sweet, so you have the Manjar Blanco, which is the caramel. I'm just going to zoom in on that. And then you can kind of see the lemon. It is like the lemon skin and they've turned it into a kind of marmalade. And yeah, it is not sour at all. This is great. I like it. So next up I'm having Chocolate Tejas con leche con mani. And mani means peanuts, so I'm excited about this one. Just judging by touching it right now this one is even slimier than the one before. Okay, it was in the fridge. Whoops. Just trying to break that off so I don't have any paper on it. And again this shape is different from the two we've tried previously. So I like my peanuts so I have high expectations. Oh man, that is like a Snicker's bar on steroids. That is like so so tasty. Really good quality chocolate and just a massive generous amount of caramel. And then you've got the great big peanuts that I'm biting into too, so I mean this for me is about as close as it gets to being a perfect chocolate bar. And last but not least we have one called chocotejas pasas borrachas. And pasas borachas means drunk raisins so I'm assuming they've been soaked in some kind of alcohol. We like our drunk food. So let's unveil. We sure do like our drunk food. There we have it. Okay, it is chocolate covered. I haven't found any raisins yet. No drunkenness? No, raisins. Oh, okay at the bottom. Show me. I think there is some kind of raisin paste. Oh, no there is a raisin. Show me. Where? Oh, we found it. We discovered the raisin. There we go. So you've got to take a bite with the raisin now. Come on, do it properly. Oh, that's a drunk raisin for sure. That's been soaked in alcohol for a long time. Like drunk drunk? Partying all night long raisin? I would say so, yeah. It's really good. I think this is actually my favorite one so far. Alright, to wrap things up. What I really liked about those was that each and every one was really unique and different. Not only in shape but in taste and texture. Some of them reminded me of fudge whereas others reminded me more of eating like a chocolate turtle. And in terms of pricing each of those costs 3 Soles and 50 cents, so perhaps a little pricy in terms of a small treat but it was gourmet chocolate with the best of ingredients. Now to take footage of the guy on the tightrope. So we thought we were going to be ending that video with the food but we've got some paragliding to show you.",False,"20151015 - Visit LIMA City Guide ∩╜£ What to SEE, DO & EAT in Lima, Peru.en.srt"

We've traveled abroad to many far off corners of the world; however, we've yet to find a city that quite lives up to the Big Apple. Join as we share our New York City travel experiences in the form of a top 50 things to do in the city guide where we cover top attractions along with extended footage in the form of vlogs where we visit places we didn't cover the first time around. From the High Line to Brooklyn Bridge and Smorgasburg to Governors Island our guide offers a bit of something for everyone. Our recent week in New York City was an action packed one. We decided to set ourselves a challenge to see and do as much as we possibly could, and that gave way to this video guide which highlights 50 of the top attractions. In a city like New York this means we barely scratched the surface, but hopefully this video will highlight the cornucopia of possibilities that is the Big Apple. Most journeys begin at Penn Station or Grand Central Terminal, and if you arrive at the later you'll be wowed by the building. We're now visiting The High Line, which is an old section of rail tracks that used to run from Chelsea all the way to the Meatpacking district. This area has actually been reclaimed and turned into a park which is pretty cool. The Meatpacking District was once home to markets, slaughterhouses, and packaging plants, but times have changed. Today you'll find a mixture of trendy restaurants, clubs and boutiques. The Village used to be a bohemian neighborhood that drew artists and musicians, but today you're more likely to find upper middle class families living here. The streets are shaded and quiet, and it's a nice place for a casual stroll. Before coming to New York City there were a few things I absolutely wanted to do and one of them was to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and I'm doing that right now. Completed in 1883, Brooklyn Bridge is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the United States. It connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Today we are over in Williamsburg which is one of the more popular neighborhoods here in Brooklyn. It definitely has a very young feel. I'm seeing a lot of twenty something year old's and that means lots of flea markets, independent restaurants and art galleries. Williamsburg has become quite popular given its lower rent prices. University students and young professionals have been flocking to this part of town. We got to see a lot of cool street art around Williamsburg, including murals along Bedford, Fillmore, and Roebling. This is a massive park located in Brooklyn and it was designed by the same landscape architects who brought Central Park to life. We are now visiting the historic district of DUMBO and that stands for down under the Manhattan bridge overpass. You can walk along the riverfront for a great view of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges and the Manhattan skyline. You can't come to New York and not have a slice of pizza. I can't think of a better place to have it here than in Brooklyn. We were kind of tired from a long day of walking and we decided to take a little break at Bryant Park. Low and behold we found that they have free board games that anyone can use throughout the day. You'll catch friends, couples, and families playing games like chess, dominoes and scrabble. During the summer months, Bryant Park also becomes a popular hangout spot for people looking to relax and even work on their tans. After visiting Bryant Park, you'll want to pop into the library for a look at the beautiful interior. The Staten Island Ferry is free of charge and this makes it really popular with visitors who want to catch a glimpse of the Statue of Liberty from a distance. If you want to get a closer look at Lady Liberty, you'll have to buy tickets to Liberty Island. If you make reservations well in advance, you can even climb to the viewing platform inside the crown. Battery Park is located on the southern tip of Manhattan. It is home to a few different memorials and you'll also catch a lot of visitors hanging out in this area as they wait to catch a ferry. Little Italy may be slowly shrinking, but it's still a great place to grab some Italian food & a gelato for dessert. Having both lived in South Korea, we were thrilled to come across Manhattan's own Little Korea. We seized the opportunity and found a restaurant serving kimchi, pajeon, and kimchi bokkeum bap. If you're looking for a bargain, Chinatown is a fun place to visit. The storefronts usually spill onto the sidewalks. It's one of the few places where you can haggle on the price of things. Coney Island is all about good old fashioned fun. You can ride roller coasters, stroll down the boardwalk, enjoy some beach time, and then head over the Nathan's Famous hot dogs. We happened to be here during a parade, which explains why the streets were so busy. And that's our next tip - if you're here in June, don't miss the Mermaid Parade! We are now in the northwest end of Manhattan visiting The Cloisters and this building was built in the Medieval architectural style and it is home to some really lovely sculptures and paintings so we're going to be visiting those. The Cloisters will make you feel like you've traveled over to Europe. This place a peaceful retreat from Manhattan's busy streets. The Apollo is one of the most famous music halls in New York City. Amateur Night is on Wednesdays, and it's great for spotting upcoming talent. We're in Harlem for some soul food and we've heard some great things about Sylvia's. We can't wait to go and have some fried chicken. We ended up having smothered chicken, and it melted in our mouths. Delicious! While in the city we also dropped by the National September 11 Memorial. We then made our way to Trinity Church which holds one of the oldest burial grounds in Manhattan and is the final resting place of many historic figures. We're here now at Wall Street where millions are made and lost. We're now visiting the Lincoln Center, which is a space that celebrates the performing arts. It is home to the opera, the ballet and the theater. Art aficionados will love the possibilities the Lincoln Center offers. While I wouldn't recommend biking Manhattan's congested streets, Central Park really is a great place for a bike ride. If you're looking to cover a lot of ground, you can pick up a bike from one of the many rental shops. One thing you absolutely have to do when you come to New York is watch a New York Yankees baseball game. Right now we're at Yankee Stadium and this is the most historic baseball franchise. They've won more World Series than any other team. We have a very exciting day of museum hopping ahead of us. Our first stop is the MET or the Metropolitan Museum of Art and I'm really looking forward to browsing the different galleries. Admission to the Met is by suggested donation only, meaning you can give whatever you can afford. This triangular shaped skyscraper is one of the most iconic buildings in the city. If you approach the building from a certain angle it looks 2-dimensional. Washington Square Park is popular with families looking to cool down during the summer months. There is a large fountain where kids like to climb and splash around. The park is also known for its arch which is reminiscent of that in Paris. And while you visit Washington Square Park, you can also take the opportunity to swing by the NYU campus. The National Museum of the American Indian has a very interesting collection, and the best part is that admission is free of charge. The American Museum of Natural History is located in the Upper West Side, and it has an extensive dinosaur collection. We are now in Times Square - the busiest intersection in all of New York City. If you're going to be visiting I recommend you come at night time when all of the lights are on and it is just crowded. Times Square has often been nicknamed ""The Center of the Universe"" and ""The Crossroads of the World"". An estimated 330,000 people pass through daily. Modern art lovers can pop into the MoMa for a visit. A really fun way to get over to Roosevelt Island is to take a cable car from Manhattan. This tramway runs from Manhattan to Roosevelt Island and the ride lasts 3 minutes. It's a fun way to get an aerial overview of the city, but it's also slightly unnerving if you don't like heights! Ahh, Fifth Avenue is a shopping Mecca. The street is lined with prestigious high-end boutiques, and it's considered to be one of the most expensive shopping streets in the world. The Top of the Rock Observation Deck is located on the 70th floor and offers 360 degree unobstructed views. The Empire State Building was the world's tallest building for almost 40 years. While it has been surpassed many times since, it still boasts some of the best views of New York City. Carnegie Hall is a concert venue and it often plays host to classical performances. This morning we're exploring Central Park also known as the lungs of New York City. Now this park is massive and there are so many different entrances. It is almost like a bit of a maze. If you really want to see the park properly you've got to come several times and you've got to enter from different vantage points. Central Park is massive and there are so many places to visit within its boundaries. We managed to visit Belvedere Castle, the Great Lawn, Shakespeare Garden, The Ramble, The Jackie Onassis Reservoir, the Alice in Wonderland Statue, and we still left feeling like we barely scratched the surface. Strawberry Fields is a section of Central Park dedicated to the memory of John Lennon. This was a place Lennon used to frequent, and travelers from far and wide stop by to leave a rose and pay their respects. We're just outside of the MET and I've got a giant pretzel in my hand. It is piping hot. It is delicious. I'm going to try a bite. It is really dough-y and wow is it ever salty. You can't come to New York without taking in a musical. There are so many different ones you can choose from Mama Mia to Phantom of the Opera. We are here now at Madison Square Garden which is home to the NHL's New York Rangers one of the most historic hockey teams. This building is one of the most famous in the whole world for entertainment. You can watch concerts, you can watch shows. This is where lots of live performances happen. This is a memorial site to the unnamed free and enslaved Africans who were buried here. It was only rediscovered in 1991. The cool thing about this intersection is that it's the point from which all official distances from New York City are measured. One of the best ways to get around New York City is of course by Metro. I've got this MetroCard over here and I paid thirty dollars and this has allowed me to go around the city for seven full days with unlimited use. If you want to really explore New York City, we recommend picking up a MetroCard so that you can zip around the city with no restrictions. It's cheap and it's efficient. And that concludes a look at our very busy week in New York City. I'm still shocked we managed to cover so many attractions, but the great thing about this city is that distances aren't very long and there's always something really cool worth checking out around each corner. Have you been to New York? What are your favorite things about this city? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section below. Alright, so we are going out for a bit of an unusual breakfast this morning. We are here in the lower east side to have breakfast at Katz's deli. Now they specialize in corned beef and pastrami sandwiches and I am starving. So let's go in there and order some food. So here is the food we ordered. We ended up getting one corned beef sandwich, one pastrami sandwich and they both came with a whole bunch of pickles. Check it out. Look at those pickles. Wow. This looks fantastic. Katz's deli has been around since 1888. It is a true institution. And what makes their meat so special is the curing process. Apparently, it takes over 30 days. Alright, so you're starting with pastrami. Just show us like how much meat is in there. Like that is ridiculous. You will not find a sandwich that thick with meat. Yep, so it is served on rye bread with lots of mustard. And I love pastrami sandwiches so I have high expectations. Wow. That is so good. The meat is so juicy. It just falls apart the minute you bite in to it. And it is so tender, so flavorful. And it is just perfectly paired with the mustard. That combination is fantastic. One more bite. Mmmm. Check it out. Alright, and so I have the other sandwich. The corn beef sandwich. Look at that. Oh, wow. The behemoth. I'm going to try to eat it without having too much of it falling off. Struggling there? A little messy. That was way too big of a bite. But oh my. That meat is as tender as it gets. And I like that they keep a little bit of the fat on it. It is really juicy and it has got a bit of a greasy feel as you are chewing it. So so good. And let's not forget the pickles. Yeah, for this type of sandwich you can not have it without pickles. Like it is also the perfect pairing. You've got to have your mustard and you've got to have your pickles. That's nice. So out of the two sandwiches which one do you like the most? My favorite is definitely the pastrami. This one that I'm holding here. I just find that the meat is a lot more tender. It is just a lot easier to eat. Um, and the flavor. Yeah, I don't know what it is but this one is pretty special. So if you come to Katz's I highly highly recommend the pastrami sandwich. It's great. So again there is a Montreal New York connection. While in Montreal you can go to a place called Schwartz's which specializes in Canadian smoked meat sandwiches. Which is similar to the pastrami one. There is a bit of a difference. It is hard to say which one I like better. I love them both to be honest and if you can try them both. If you are in Montreal and in New York I highly recommend you do that. Alright, so the price. How much did these sandwiches cost? Well, they are not cheap because this place is really famous. They each come in at just under $20. But at the same time they are quite filling. Like I'm still struggling to finish my first piece. Like this is going to be more of a brunch than a breakfast. Yeah. Yeah, so bring your appetite when you come here and yeah bring your wallet as well. So it is a Saturday here in Williamsburg. And we are at Smorgasburg which is a really fun outdoor food market. They have over 100 hundred vendors that are just setting up right now. So we're here to have breakfast. We're just going to sample some food and it just seems like a really fun spot to meet some friends, have a late brunch. So yeah, let's get started. We're really hot so I think we're going to go for the ice cream sandwich first, right? Excited about that? Sure am. So this is my oat chocolate chunk ice cream cookie. It has got fudge and sea salt. And it looks amazing. Let's get a close-up of it. Check it out. I'm going to take a bite before it starts melting in this heat. How is that? Wow! That is a gourmet ice cream cookie. Mmmm. Feeling seriously parched huh? It is time for some lemonade. So it is time to try this lemonade which I think is made with organic cane sugar. Like there is nothing more refreshing than ice cold lemonade on a hot day. Alright, so we've got an original black bubble tea. And basically the theme of this afternoon has been trying to cool off as you've probably noticed we've just been having things like ice creams and drinks and lemonades. Now we've got bubble tea. It is really refreshing. I love the tapioca little bubbles. Oh, show us the bubbles. Right there. There they are. It looks good. And let's share. Hahaha. Alright, to wrap things up here at Smorgasburg here in Williamsburg we had a really good time kind of just wandering around. We sampled some different food. Mostly we were just eating things and drinking things to kind of cool off. The prices are a little bit high. So it does add up after a while but it is the kind of place where you come to socialize, to be out in the sun and to have a good time. And to sample all kinds of different food. So it is a beautiful Sunday here in New York City. And we decided to take the ferry over to Governors Island. It is less than half a mile from lower Manhattan. So here we are just enjoying nature, walking around and I think we're going to go grab some food soon because, as usual, we're hungry. So right now we are visiting Castle Williams and over the years this place has been a fort, a prison and now a community center so it is pretty cool. They have some interactive art and music happening. So yeah, we're just taking a little tour. So far I'm really enjoying the relaxed vibe of this island. It is just so calm here. And there are these really neat things to do. Like there is a little flea market behind us. We know where to go when there is a fork and a knife. Alright, so we just hit up a little food truck. And we've got burritos and quesadillas. I don't know what you're having for lunch but my lunch looks awesome. Ha. Alright, so I'm starting with the burrito. Mmmm. That is quite nice. I'm starving so honestly anything would taste good right now. Looks like we've got dessert over here. Yeah, so we were craving a little sweet treat after that lunch. Which was just okay., So over here we have organic apple cider ice cream sandwich donuts. Which is something I've never had before. It looks amazing. It is a little melty. I've never had that either. I've had homemade ice cream sandwiches. Doughnut form? How is that? Oh, yeah. Wow. That is amazing. A little messy. And it is melting fast because it is so hot out. So I'm just going to eat it. So after stuffing our beaks, what do we do? Well, we found the hammock grove which is a lovely little spot with lots of hammocks where you can just hang out and digest your meal pretty much. Siesta time huh? Oh, yeah. So right now we're touring the Commanding Officer's quarters. Let's have a look. So the home is empty now and all of the furniture has been removed but it has kind of been turned into a like a little art gallery. So you'll notice that there are paintings on the walls but that is it. Everything else is bare. And I love how on this island you can just kind of walk into these homes and just like you know. Yeah, they have big welcome flags so that you can just go in, have a look and see what the home was once like. Alright, and that concludes our visit to Governors Island. It was just a short trip. Um, one of the things that we noticed was that the island is even smaller than what we expected. It is the kind of place that you can probably visit in two to three hours including a lunch time. So today we are having lunch at one of our favorite hamburger joints. We are here at Shake Shack which is a name that is widely known across the US. We try to eat here every time we are in the States and New York City is no exception. Now today we are not just at any Shake Shack. We are at the original Shake Shack which is located in Madison Square Park. And this actually started out as a little hot dog cart and now it is grown in to a huge franchise. So super excited to be eating here and I'm also really hungry so let's go order. And this is the line to order Shake Shack. And we're going to stand here and get our food. So we've finally ordered and now we're just waiting. But along with a whole bunch of other people. Look who just came back. I was so scared to drop it. It's finally here. Check it out. So the wait is over. Our food has finally arrived and if you have look over here we got the SmokeShack. I got the single and Sam got the double because he's a hungry boy. And we also have our french fries. Cheese fries actually. That looks delicious. And that is not everything. We have a cheesecake milkshake. Not just cheesecake. Strawberry cheesecake. Awesome. So let's dig in. Look at that thing of beauty. Oh, yeah. That is why we stood in line for fifteen minutes and waited another twenty minutes for our food to be ready. This is like the best hamburger I've ever had. Seriously, one of the best things we did while we were in Las Vegas was try Shake Shack there. Now this one here in New York City is the original and so I have high expectations for this burger. I've got the Shake Shack double which means it has two patties, it has got lots of cheese and it has got bacon. Wow! Fabulous is it? It is just unbelievably good. This is my favorite burger by far. Okay, so now it is time for the cheesy fries. Right over here. It looks sloppy and greasy and cheesy. Just the way we like it. It kind of tastes like french fries with cheese whiz poured on top. Like hot gooey cheese whiz. Mmmm. Wow! Okay, just a little tip if you want to visit the original Shake Shack. We came here and started standing in line at about 11:20 or 11:30 and it was already busy. Now that it is past noon I think there is about two to three times the amount of people standing in line. So if you want to come I would suggest maybe right around eleven when it opens and then you won't have to wait as long for your burger. And because we're not piggy enough, what do we have? Well, a milkshake was not enough so we've gone back for custard. So this is a vanilla custard with fudge. Oh yeah. Digging that? I've never had frozen custard before. So it is a new flavor for me. It's like custard ice cream but creamier. It's smoother. Alright, to wrap things up. I'm not even entirely sure what makes this burger better than other fast food burgers but I think it has to do with quality ingredients. The meat is just so juicy, there is a lot of cheese and the bun is delicious. They also have like these like red hot chilies that just really enhance the taste. It is just my favorite burger right now and like we've said before I'm willing to stand in line and wait a long time for it. So hello from New York City. Sam and I are hanging out in Queens for a few days and we're just going to be visiting friends, checking out some sights and mostly eating. So today's video is actually going to be a taste test. We tracked down some of the best New York Style bagels in the city and today we're going to be sampling a whole bunch. This large bag over here holds 14 different kinds of bagels. So Sam, I hope you're feeling hungry. Alright, I kind of went overboard with my purchase. But I'm going to show you all of the bagels. One by one. Egg bagel. Pumpernickel bagel. Poppy seed bagel. French Toast bagel. Blueberry bagel. Cinnamon raisin bagel. Everything bagel. And there is a whole bunch more. And if get bored I can always use this bag to exercise. It is seriously heavy. So last summer we traveled to Montreal where we tried a whole bunch of bagels. So what is the difference between Montreal bagels and New York bagels? Well apparently the Montreal ones are smaller, thicker and sweeter whereas the New York City bagels are larger and doughier. So let's start eating them. The first thing that comes to mind when I try a New York style bagel is just how massive these are. Like these are huge. Like check out this thing. It is like holding a brick. If someone ever stole my wallet I could throw one of these at them. Wham, right in the head. That would knock them right out. But instead of throwing them at somebody I think we'll try eating them right now. So I've had my eye on this one for a while. This is the everything bagel. And it smells amazing. I think there has to be some garlic like in there because the aroma it is giving off is just wonderful. So I'm not even going to bother putting cream cheese or any kind of spreads on it. I'm just taking a big bite. Dig right in. Hmmm. Well, it really is doughy and chewy. Look at that. Oh yeah. So that is poppy seed and roasted garlic on the exterior and sesame seed. That is just wonderful. Like you can eat it plain. It is flavorful as it is. Amazing. I know this the first one I'm trying but I think it is my favorite. Alright, I'm going to be focusing on more of the sweeter bagels. This one here is the french toast bagel. And I've decided to pair this with one of the cream cheeses that we bought. This is raisin and walnut cream cheese. Okay, I'm totally being lazy as well. I'm not cutting open the bagels. I'm just putting a bit of the spread on. Time to bite. Mmm. Wow. Yeah, like seriously you couldn't find a better spread for this particular bagel. Like they compliment each other perfectly. This is a bit of a sweeter bagel and it is just amazing. Okay, so next up we have the egg bagel which is the size of my face. Let's be honest here. Um, again I'm going to try this one without cream cheese. I think that might be the biggest one. Yeah. The biggest one of the bunch. My bite was too big. Hahahaha. Well, greedy pants, how was that? Alright, so. That is the egg bagel. It is yellow. A huh. Um, I thought it would be a little fluffier than the other ones. Kind of like egg bread. But it is really not. It is still quite dense. It is nice. I think this one would be nice with like salty butter. Alright, and next up I've got one of my favorite bagels of all time the cinnamon raisin bagel. And not much needs to be explained about this one. Let's just bite right in. That's really good. My personal tip for when having this particular bagel is to toast it and then put peanut butter on. That is an amazing combo. And the last one here is pumpernickel and it smells fantastic. If you like German bread you're going to like this one. Mmmm. Again the bite was a little too big. Now I can't speak. This bagel. This would be perfect with cream cheese and some smoked salmon on top. Mmmmm. Hmmmm. Alright, and the last one for me here is the blueberry bagel. And if you look closely here it definitely is purple. Um, I've never tired a blueberry bagel before. I love blueberries so this should be exciting. Oh yeah, look at that. You can taste the blueberry. Um, it is not overpowering like you still have like the normal bagel taste but it is just like that extra little blueberry flavor. It is really good. Seriously, those bagels were fantastic. We're both really getting stuffed at this point. If you want to buy them you can go to New York City Bagel and Coffee House which is located in Queens Astoria. The Coney Island Mermaid parade is an annual spectacle celebrating the beginning of the summer season in late June. Thousands converge to watch performers dancing and singing. Even Elvis showed up! It was mostly a happy event; however, a select few decided to brawl instead. With perfect weather we marveled at the extraordinary and often times risque marine costumes. What an event! If you're in New York in June definitely consider going to the Mermaid Parade. I promise you that you won't be the only one there.",False,"20150915 - Visit NEW YORK City Guide ∩╜£ What to SEE, DO & EAT in New York, USA.en.srt"

Although these are some of the biggest draws for tourists the country has so much more to offer. Join us as we present to you our 20 day adventure going from Johannesburg all the way to Cape Town. Some of the top travel highlights included a Kruger National Park safari, hiking along the Wild Coast, canoeing in Wilderness and climbing mountains in Northern Drakensberg. In terms of our taste buds we tried Biltong for the first time and devoured South African barbecue – better know as Braai – on more than one occasion. There are few countries that are as unique and diverse as South Africa. Come find out what makes it shine. This is South Africa! Our first full day in South Africa started with a long drive from Johannesburg towards Kruger National Park. Even though our safari wouldn't begin until the following day we enjoyed some great views of the countryside and even visited a wildlife rehabilitation center. Okay, so we've been driving all morning. We've actually been up since five AM and we are finally stopping for lunch. We're taking a little break. And yeah, we're just going to enjoy a meal before we continue on towards the park. Alright, so our meal has arrived. What are we having? We're having a Fred Flinstone portion of ribs. Take a look at this. This is enormous. Ready to dig in! And we're sharing this. There is no way I could eat this all by myself. Especially after being in a bus all day. Alright, Fred Flinstone. And the only way to eat these properly is with your hands. Those are pretty good ribs. Okay, so this afternoon we are visiting the Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre. We are going to be visiting some animals and just learning about the rehabilitation effort that is going on here. And yeah, let's go have a look around. Some of the main reasons for rescues include animals being affected by power-lines, snares and also poisoning. It was awesome to see all of the animals but the honey badger truly stole the show. Okay, so today is the big day. Yesterday afternoon we reached the outskirts of Kruger National Park and today we're actually going in to spot some of the wildlife. So we're going in for a sunrise drive. It is really earlier. It is about 5:15 am right now. We're going to head into the park and - yeah - it is safari time! Okay, so we finally reached the park and I'm going to give you a little tour of our cool truck for the day. Come on over. Come on in. Make that big climb up there. Yeah, I'm in. One thing that totally surprised me was just how close we got to the lions. I think it was only about 10 meters away from the road. So they were really docile and the lioness was just sleeping and cleaning its cubs and in the back there was the big alpha male just stretching and yawning. It was surreal. So that's been an amazing safari so far. It is only 10 in the morning and we've already seen more wildlife than I ever imagined. We saw lions, elephants, wildebeest. Oh, gosh more than I can even remember. Yeah, it was amazing and we were able to get up close and have a good look at them. So it has been so much fun. So tell us what happened to you at lunchtime today? So the most ridiculous thing happened to me during lunch. A bird shit right here. It ricochet of off my shoulder all the way down to here. And while I was still recovering from the shock from that another bird shitted on this side. So I got hit on both shoulders but apparently if a bird shits on you it is good luck. So I have a double dose of good luck. Maybe that means I'm going to see cheetahs this afternoon. Woo hoo! Right now we're visiting a private game reserve to see even more cool wildlife. And what caught us for a total surprise is that we saw so many giraffes. Apparently this is the most giraffes have ever been spotted out here. So we saw them walk right in front of our vehicle and we even saw a couple of them fighting. They were swinging their heads at each other. It was completely bonkers. Yeah, so overall it has been an amazing day. We saw more animals than we ever expected. And what a beautiful way to wrap up the day. Now we're just going to watch the sunset, drink some wine and enjoy some cheese. And do it all over again tomorrow. Okay, so it is day two on safari and we are heading back to Kruger National Park. The focus today is going to be to find animals like being around the water. So we're going to be visiting a watering hole maybe seeing some buffalo, some hippos and we'll see what else we can find. So again, it's an early start. It's around five thirty in the morning and we're going to head on out there. So far, so good as far as the weather today. It looks like we're going to have a lot better visibility. We had an amazing sunrise to witness this morning. But it is chilly and so we're all bundled up. It's a lot colder than it was yesterday but the sun is coming out. We actually had a little bit of drizzle yesterday, so it'll be warmer. Just waiting for it to get warmer. And I think we're going to have even better visibility for photos and video in terms of taking shots of the animals. So, exciting stuff! Okay, so a pretty cool morning so far. We managed to spot the ever elusive leopard. So that was pretty cool. And we also saw a heard of elephants that were just crossing the road. There was about fifteen or twenty of them, so that was also a pretty impressive sight. One of the coolest things that I've seen today was at a watering hole. There was a crocodile and it was waiting for an impala to drink. And it was so close to attacking it. Like we almost saw this ridiculous crazy scene. Anyways, the crocodile was unsuccessful and it ended up attacking another crocodile. And we captured a bit of that footage. One safari tip to consider is to dress with all kinds of layers. This morning it was freezing. I had on a fleece, I had on a windbreaker and now by the afternoon I'm peeling down to just this tiny kind of athletic shirt. And you've got thick jogging pants on. Yeah, so I wish I had shorts right now for that. Alright, so we are wrapping up our second day of safari. We're going to be heading to the campgrounds soon and we're going to have our first braai for dinner and apparently that is South African barbecue so it should be tasty. Alright, so this morning we are in Drakensberg. That means the dragon's mountain. And we're going to be doing a bit of a hike on a stretch that is called the Amphitheatre. And yeah, the Drakensberg are actually the border between South Africa and Lesotho. So that is a pretty cool little fact. We've been told to prepare for any kind of weather. It could be sunny. It could be rainy. It could be snowing any minute. So we're ready for some adventure. Let's go hiking! I've really been enjoying the views so far. I would classify this as a lower-intermediate hike. It is not for people who really have a fear of heights. There are some vertical parts where you have to go up ladders and down ladders. And that part would be a deal breaker for some people. But as far as the views and just the actual hike itself it is really enjoyable. So this is actually one of the ladders that you have to climb down on the way back. And I believe there are two sets of ladders to deal with. So something to consider if you are afraid of heights. We've actually decided to just stay back and enjoy a very relaxed lunch because neither Sam nor I enjoy heights and this was making us a little bit nervous. But everyone else was very adventurous, very brave so you can give it a try if you come out here. Okay, so now it is time for lunch. Woo! Alright, so we are coming to the end of our hike here in Drakensberg. And even though we didn't reach the top it was still an incredible trip. Like it was so scenic, so beautiful, so I'm glad we came. And if you find yourself traveling through South Africa definitely consider this region. So, good morning. Today we are in Northern Drakensberg. We've been staying at a really cool hostel called Amphitheater backpackers. And they have a little hike that you can do just outside of their property. So we're just over at the gate right now. We're going to head out and do a little bit of exploring on foot. It's a beautiful morning. We witnessed the most amazing sunrise yet again. And now it is time for a bit of exercise. We're at a crossroads over here. Big tree this way. Big Dam that way. Oh, which way will we go? Okay, this way. It is decided. Big tree. This is like falling the yellow brick road. Come on, sing it for us. Follow the yellow brick road. Follow the yellow brick road. So we are at an another crossroads. We can go towards the airstrip or towards the river. I think we're going to choose the river just because it is starting to get really hot. I've already started taking off several layers. And we're running out of time. And some water would be nice. I really enjoyed this walk. Sometimes it is great to just get off of the beaten track once in a while and just relax. And that concludes our little walk around. I think it is time for a cold beer. Okay, so a new country, a new taste test. We are in South Africa right now and you can't come to this country and not try Biltong. So that is what I have right here in this brown paper bag. So Biltong is a dried cured meat similar to beef jerky and this is what it looks like. So we got ourselves some beef biltong but apparently you can get different kinds of meats. Like game meat or ostrich. This is cow. And it is quite hard and chewy but it makes a really nice snack, so let's say you're riding the bus or going on a really long trip it is kind of nice to just have a bag full and be munching away. That's what we have been doing for the past few days. So for me Biltong is kind of like premium jerky. And there is three key differences. First off, it is sliced a lot thicker. Secondly, they use vinegar in the curing process along with salt and pepper. Which is a little bit different from regular jerky which doesn't have any vinegar whatsoever. And the third key difference is Biltong is not smoked whereas jerky is. Okay, so the purchasing process? What was awesome is that we went into a kind of like what would be considered a deli that specialized in Biltong. And when we went in there was all of these different kinds of dried meat hanging up in different sections. There was one that was game meat, there was one that was regular, there was a premium kind. I can't remember but there was a forth kind as well. And anyways, what you would do is pick this meat off of a hook and bring it over to these ladies who would then put it through a grinder and it would go into this bag like that. So it was a really cool to be right there involved in the process. And it just made it a lot more special. And the other thing that I really noticed that was a big difference is that the quality of the actual meat itself is a lot better than what comes from say packaged pre-packed stuff you would find in a store. So the word Biltong. What does it mean? I actually had to look this up but now I can tell you. So 'Bil' apparently comes from the Dutch word for rump and 'Tong' means strip or tongue. But contrary to popular belief Biltong is not made from bull's tongue, so don't be afraid to try it because of that. What have you got in your hand over there? Okay, and last but not least we have something called Cabanossi which kind of looks like a dried pepperoni stick. We also picked this up at the same store we got the Biltong. So I'm going to try that. Yeah, so it is kind of like a greasy salami stick. Again, chewy, salty, flavorful. I think it makes a great snack. Which one do you like better? Or do you like them both? I do like them both but this reminds me of salami or like a pepperoni stick so it is something I am familiar with. So I quite enjoy the flavor. One more bite. So when you're visiting South Africa, unless of course you're a vegetarian, be sure to try Biltong. I swear it is pretty much addicting. I can't seem to stop myself over here. Okay, so we are continuing our trip across South Africa. Right now we've arrived in the Wild Coast and we're staying at a cool hostel called The Wild Lubanzi which is just off in the distance over there. And apparently there is a really cool hike we can do from here, so we're heading to a place called Hole In The Wall. It should take us about an hour and a half, so let's get going. So we've climbed the top of the hill and this is probably the best vantage point we've had all day. So we've arrived at the Hole In The Wall and as the name suggests it is just a hole right in front of the surface. So we've been befriended by a local who has offered to show us around. So far he has taken us to the Hole In The Wall which was amazing. And now apparently we're off to visit his house. So we're just following him. So our little guided tour through the villages is now over and we're trying to find our way back. We have a general idea of where we need to go, so let's hope we get back in time for lunch. Sleep kitties. Sleepy kitties. Sleepy kitties. Open your eyes. Alright, so we are continuing our South Africa road trip. Right now we are staying in Chintsa at Buccaneers Lodge and we've got some fantastic views of the beach happening. So we're just going to be relaxing here for the next few days enjoying some downtime, some beach time and right now we're going to give you a little tour. Today we have a horse riding adventure coming up so we're just going to meet our horses and get geared up and get ready to go. Apparently, we're going down to the beach so it should be fun. Alright, so this is my horse over here. It's name is Sisci. You're very sweet. It seems gentle enough. So that has been a really fun ride so far. We're down at the beach right now and we've been trotting with the horses. My knees are feeling a little bit wobbly now that I'm off the horse but it has been a really good time. And also what's funny is getting to see the horses personalities. I have one that loves to eat. And it just keeps stopping to munch on grass. And Sam has a horse that is very itchy and likes to scratch his butt against branches and trunks and anything it finds. And my horse doesn't get along with three other ones. Yeah. So this morning we are in Wilderness and we've decided to do a bit of canoeing. We're out on the water now and it is a beautiful day, so we're just going to be traveling upstream and maybe doing a little bit of hiking later. So we've done a lot of kayaking before together but this is our very first time to canoe. And it is definitely a little bit more stable. Part of that has to do with the canoe being wider than a kayak. The other part has to do with just these waters. They couldn't be any more calmer. I know, it is like being on a mirror. Seriously. Look at that. Hardly any waves or ripples. Here comes another one. If you see another one come by let me know. Alright, so we're coming up on a little rope bridge. We're just going to canoe right under it. Okay, so that is as far as we can get on our canoes. We are going to be hiking the rest of the way. Get moving. Hahaha. Alrighty, so we're off the river now and we're going to be doing a bit of hiking. We've got our little maps so hopefully we won't get too lost. Yeah, let's head in to the unknown. I think a lot of people who come to South Africa have this type of image of the landscape being completely barren and dry. Kind of just safari land. But there is so much diversity here. And this is a really good example. We're now walking through a lush rain forest. Let's go. I seriously have no idea what animal that was. But it was very cute. So I think we're getting closer to the waterfalls. I can hear them off in the distance. And this looks like a bit of a different path so let's go. Well, well, I don't know if you can hear that but it sounds like we made it to the waterfalls. So we're almost there just follow me a bit longer. We'll show you the water. And we made it! So we're now on our way back. We saw the waterfalls and we're heading back to find our canoes. And we met a few travelers along the way. A few hikers who are also making their way to the waterfall. And they asked us, you know, how far to get there? And it made me realize that Canadians are some of the only people who measure distances based on time. How long it takes to get there. They are asking us how many kilometers. How many miles? And that is such a typical question but a Canadian will tell you like 10 or 15 minutes or so. Yep, that's us. Well Hello from South Africa. We just finished raiding a supermarket where we picked up as many South African snacks as we could. We grabbed chips, chocolate bars, soda drinks and we're going to try them all for you. So this is our South African taste test. So over here I've got myself Nik Naks. It's a maize snack and I think the packaging looks great. Have a look in the bag. Those kind of look like cheesies. They look like cheese puffs and they taste like cheese puffs. It's very airy and crunchy. It's a nice light snack. Good snack for the road. I'm giving it the thumbs up. Road tripping snack. I'm trying here the Chocolate Log. And I have a feeling, oh yeah, it is a marshmallow on a crispy wafer. I wonder if it is going to taste a bit like a wagon wheel or a krembo. Show us the bar. What does it look like? Yeah, we've got the crunchy part on the bottom and we've got the marshmallow in the middle. That is a really really good bar. Mmm. Yum. So this one looks interesting. It is really similar to the Mars bars that we have in North America. Even the packaging and the color on the packaging is quite similar. But this is called Now. Eat it now! Now! Chocolate now! I wonder if it will be a similar filling. It looks similar too. It's got caramel and how do you call it, nougat? Chocolate. Yeah, you know what, this to me tastes just like a Mars Bar. Just different name, that is all it is. Yeah, good stuff. Being the cat lover that I am when we were divvying up the snacks we kind of had an almost like a draft. Like a lottery. I chose the Black Cat bar. So it is a peanut snack packed with peanut power apparently. Let's try that out. It looks like it has got some kind of like a toffee or a something sticky and sweet keeping it together. Oh gosh, I'm going to break my tooth. It is super crunchy. Yeah, really really sweet. And it is kind of like, I don't know, like a honey or a caramel that is hardened. Really crunchy, packed with peanuts, pretty much delicious. Okay, I'm not sure what this one is called but I think Beacon is the brand and Whippy is the name. And it says mmm Mallows. I think it is supposed to be like marshmallows or something. Mallows. Mallows. Soft strawberry flavored mallow smothered in chocolate and coconut. We call it marshmallow back in Canada but we'll go with mallows. Let's see. Lekker. So it is like a pink and white marshmallow inside. Nice and spongy. It doesn't really have a strong strawberry flavor which is what I was expecting because of the pink packaging. It is just like a sweet fluffy marshmallow inside. It's good. I like it. Wonder Bar. And if I remember correctly we have something by the same name in Canada but I'm not entirely sure. There is definitely a wonder something kind of chocolate bar. But this appears to be totally different. I have a feeling this is mint chocolate. It is mint flavored apparently. And it appears to be really small. Some kind of an ant on me. Okay. So let's try that. Can you see the green. Yeah, kind of. Oh, Wow. That is a really unique mint chocolate bar. It's like nothing I've really had before. It's got a crunchiness to it. Almost like a cookie flavor. Wow. The mint is really hitting me strong. The first time you have a bite you don't really taste it that much. But as you're chewing it, a really strong mint flavor. It is kind of like an after eight? Stronger mint flavor than that. I like it even more. Next up, we have something called Diddle Daddle by Jumping Jack. Diddle Daddles. That sounds like something like a taddle. Tiddle taddle. Don't diddle daddle. Okay, so it looks like caramelized popcorn. So it is sweet popcorn. I think you would call this kettle corn in Canada, right? Yeah, I think. Sweet kettle corn. Sweet popcorn. Caramelized. It doesn't have a buttery flavor. It is just strictly caramel. Perfect for watching a movie, huh? Diddle Daddle. Don't diddle daddle. Or do diddle daddle. So I've got a TV bar. Shall I assume you're supposed to eat this while watching TV. Who knows? So, as it says here, tropical coconut, crunchy rice puffs and smooth white chocolate. Sounds pretty good to me. Let's see the white chocolate coating here. Okay, you know what? That's kind of like something in between a granola bar and a chocolate bar. Would you say it is healthy? No, it's got a lot of sugar for sure. It's good though. You can definitely taste that coconut. Now I'm moving on to the Niki cluster coconut clustered coated in smooth milk chocolate. Okay. Let's see what this is all about. I wonder if it is going to taste like a Bounty Bar. The one we have back home. Okay, so it is coated in chocolate. Oh, it is quite chocolate-y inside. I'm going to zoom in on that. It does taste a bit like coconut but I was expecting like white shredded coconut in the middle. And it is more like coconut that has been coated in chocolate. It's nice. Mmmm. I've been saving this one for near the end. I love coconut chocolate bars. They're some of my favorite. And I really like Bounty Bars and I really like Ritter Sport coconut flavor from Germany, so lets see if this Niki bar lives up to that. Oh yeah, it's amazing. Wow! Look at all of that coconut goodness in the middle here. That is amazing. That deserves another big bite even though I'm already full. Mmmm. Delicious! Okay, so next we have mini Eet Sum Mor biscuits. Eat some more of that! Come on, eat some more. I'm expecting something like short bread cookies. Oh, they're quite small. Show us one. I'll just pop one in my mouth. These are what they look like. They're tiny. Little squares. Woah! We have birds. Sam, it's like a miniature short bread cookie not overly sweet. It would go nice with a cup of tea. Are you going to eat some more? No, I'm going to move on to my next snack. Are you sure? Okay, I'm having a Lion King moment over here. These are Simba chips. Simba! What flavor? Smoked beef flavored potato chips that roars with flavour. Simba. Okay. Yeah, it is like a beef flavored chip. I don't think I've ever had anything like this before. It tastes like meat. In chip form. Okay, now the funny story about this one here. It's called Iron Brew is that they have something in Scotland that is called the same thing. But it is spelled in Scotland Irn. So we called it Urn Bru. We totally messed up. It is supposed to be called Iron Bru. Here it is spelled with a vowel, with an O so no mistakes this time. Iron Brew. This is the first time to try this. I have no idea what it tastes like. I don't think it is going to taste like the one from Scotland because that is an orange color. It is definitely different. Wow! I don't even really know how to describe it. It has a different cola flavor than anything I've ever tried before. What does it say on the bottle? What is the description? Well, it says South Africa's favorite. Um, I'll have to look to the ingredients here. Carbonated water, sugar, caramel flavor, citric acid. Yeah, it's got, it does have a bit of a caramel flavor. It's um, it's unique. That's all I can say. Another chocolate bar up ahead. This one is Beacon. Forest fruit and nut chocolate. Forest fruit, wow. It kind of reminds me of the Cadbury bars you'd get back home. The fruit and nut bars, yeah. I wonder if it is going to be similar. I think so. Dun, dah, dah, dun. It's hard chocolate. Yeah, nutty. Fruity? Yeah, it's milk chocolate with fruits, nuts. A very familiar flavor. Nothing out of the ordinary. It's good. Alright, we've done a whole other video dedicated to Biltong but this here is a kind we didn't try. Hello, Kika. She wants some snacks. You came just at the right time. You wanted the meat snacks. So this is Kudu. It is a kind of game flavor. Game meat. So let's open that up. A bite for me. That's really good meat. A bite for Kika. She's eating it off of my leg. Here, one more bite for Kika. Come on Kika. Yum, yum. That's really good. It does have that game-y kind of flavor. And it is really rich. Really high quality and you can tell there is not a lot of fat in this. So, I know we can get Cadbury all around the world but this flavor I have never seen before. What is it? Show us. We have marvelous creations and this is cookie gummy crunch. Very colorful packaging. We've got a party going on over there. Oh, yeah. Let's open this monster chocolate bar. It's huge, it must be like well over 100 grams. Maybe 200. Here, so I'm going to break a piece in half. Oh, you can see some of the cookie pieces. Okay, hold it still. Oh, you can, wow. Let's see. Yeah, so it's got cookie chunks and some blue crumbly stuff. Crunchy stuff. I couldn't tell you what candy the blue stuff is. It is just crunchy, hard candy. But the chocolate is good. The milk chocolate is good quality. Okay, I'm really excited about this product. I think it is like Ginger Beer flavored mints. And that seems like a very niche king of unique product. I can't wait to try it. Yep, those are mints. I don't think you're going to like these. I'm still finishing my jerky. Alright, ready to try these. Wow! These are strong. I'm loving this. I love strong ginger beer flavor but I have a feeling that unless you've grown up drinking ginger beer 95% of people who haven't probably wouldn't like this. This is delicious to me but this is not something that I would bring home for as a gift for friends and family. Let's say that. Next up, we have the nut basket. Tasty South African snacks and this one is roasted giant peanuts Peri Peri. And apparently peri peri is just a spice. Like a mix of different spices. I think it is supposed to be quite spicy. Hot. Let's see abot that. So this is what they look like. It's not overly spicy yet. I'm waiting for the burn to kick in. Feel the burn? I mean, it's spicy. It's got some flavor but it is not overly spicy that you're like having to chug a glass of milk. Yeah, Peri Peri peanuts. So, another thing we picked up in the supermarket: Romany Creams. Classic choc. And it says are you South Africa's biggest bakers fan? Let's find out if I am. Oh, I like that easy tear away. Nice. Use those big muscles of yours. Muscles. Okay, they are just loose. They're biscuits. So, chocolate biscuit with chocolate filing. It's a nice crunchy cookie. It would be really nice for dunking in your coffee or your tea. Yeah, chocolate. Okay, so next I'm trying something called Sparberry soft drink. Spar letta, I'm not sure if that is the brand. I'm going to assume so since the supermarket was called Spar. So Sparberry drink here we go. Oh, it is pink. Splashed it on my finger. I just poured it all over myself. I'm going to say cherry. I think it is cherry flavoured. I think it is strawberry flavored. Yeah, look. It says. Oh, no it doesn't. It could be either cherry or strawberry. I'm not sure. My puppy friend is here. Kika. Kika is here. Come Kika. Let her say hello now that I'm filming. Come. This is Kika. Kika lives here in Wilderness. And she is a cute puppy and she has been sleeping on my lap and being very very sweet these past few days. Haven't you? Are you cute Kika? Are you cute? Kika. Maybe she wants some snacks. Maybe. You arrived just at the right time. Didn't you? Alright, I've been saving this for the end because I'm thirsty after trying all that chocolate and savory snacks. This is Stoney Ginger Beer. I love ginger beer. The best ginger beer I have ever had has been in Australia. It's a lot stronger than the stuff you can get in Canada. So let's so how this Stoney stuff compares. Wow, that is pretty strong. Yeah, that is some of the best ginger beer I've ever had. I can't wait to finish that off. So, ciao from South Africa. This is Sam, Audrey and Kika signing off from Wilderness. Hi, pup. Say, bye. So we're closing off with Biltong in my hand and Kika. Come on Kika. Come, on, come get some. Come on. Come here. Here you go. So it is another beautiful day here in Wilderness. And today we are hiking out to some caves. Now these are very special caves because apparently they had built a restaurant into these caves and then the business failed and the place basically shutdown but a man moved into the restaurant in this cave and apparently he has turned it into a squatting complex where homeless people can come and stay. And he takes care of them. These are all just rumors we've been hearing from locals so we thought 'hey' let's go check it out ourselves. So that is where we are going today. And to get there we are walking along the abandoned rail tracks. Alright, lead the way. So it would appear that these tracks haven't been in use for a really long time. And some of the rock has just fallen over top and vegetation has grown over it but there is a way around. Lucky for us. Oooh! So we've reached the entrance of the tunnel. Apparently we need to go through here. And it looks dark and spooky. Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo. So that was incredible. We just got a tour from the man who runs this place. And basically it is a shelter for homeless people. He takes them in for two weeks and tries to give them a place where they can live. He feeds them. And just helps them get back on their feet. They have to go out and look for work while they are staying here. And it is just beautifully decorated. They've put a lot of detail into each of the rooms. And there is just a lot of character and personality, so it is a really funky place to check out. I liked it. You can continue hiking along the bridge to the dolphin's nose and that will take you to Vic Bay. But we're really hungry right now so we're heading back in for lunch. Right now we're at Wild Farm in Wilderness and we're waiting for one of my favorite things. It's called Braai. It's South African barbecue and it is absolutely phenomenal. So in the background we've got our lovely little log cabin. I'm drying out a towel right now. But anyways that is besides the point. The team here at the hostel is now working on the barbecue. They're stoking the fire so we are going to show you the whole process. Let's go cook some Braai. And Audrey has made a new best friend. Who is this? It's Kika. Is it playtime or nap time? It looks like nap time. You want to take this one home in your backpack? Yes. She would fit nicely. Not a bad little view from over here huh? What are you drinking? Um, apple cider. Alright, we've got the grill master here and he's going to tell us what makes Braai much better than barbecue. Well, firstly, barbecue is a sauce. Hahahaha. But the difference with a South African Braai is the fact that we use real wood instead of charcoal. And it gives a different flavor to the meat. And that is a big thing. Excuse me. What have we got here? We've got some good chicken. Look at that. This is sausage as well. That looks so good. But first. So underneath the Braai that is where you have the meat that is already done and the cheesy mushroom bread. Here is the finished product. Look at that. Wow! So that is the bread? Yep. It's the cheesy mushroom bread. Show us that. Woah. It is almost like a sandwich. A hot sandwich. That's for me. Alright, we are checking out your plate. What do we got over here? So it is all dished up. My first traditional Braai. We've got some chicken, some sausage and some meat. So I am ready to dig in. What else do we have aside from that? Well, there is salad and potatoes on the side and some feta cheese. But who is focusing on that. Okay, first bite. Who cares about that stuff. Mmmm. That is wonderful. You did a great job. Cool, man. Yeah, seriously. Alright, stop filming me and enjoy your food man. Hahahaha. Alright, I'm trying the sausage. That is amazing. South African Braai sausage is better than anything else I've ever tried. So Hello, from Cape Town. We have finally arrived in the city and this is the final stop of our three week adventure here in South Africa. This is actually our first day exploring the city and thankfully we have blue skies so we're trying to see as much as we can. And yeah, we're just going to take you on a little tour. So now that we're near the end of the trip I'm kind of reflecting on what I might have done differently. And definitely something that I'm a little bit disappointed is that we didn't spend more time in Cape Town. I know we just got here but I'm absolutely loving it. It is so gorgeous. The scenery is amazing. And I wish we had a few more days to explore. So, good morning from rainy Cape Town. Today we've signed up to do a Cape Point and Peninsula tour. So we're going to be traveling down to Cape Point by bus. We're also hauling some bicycles along. So once we get there we're planning to go biking, do a little bit of hiking and we're going to see some sights along the way. It should be fun and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the rain holds off. So this morning we're taking a boat tour to Seal Island and hopefully we'll spot some seals along the way. We're going in search of penguins. I've seemed to spot a rather large unusual penguin over here. It looks rather uncoordinated. And a little bit silly. So we're not allowed to get too close to the penguins. They may be cute but they're quite vicious with their little beaks. Alright, so this is where the fun begins. We've arrived at the Cape of Good Hope and right now we're unloading the bikes. We're going to get all suited up and get ready to go biking. Finally! We're biking in a National Park and apparently it could be a bit like a mini safari. There has been a lot of animals spotted here. Especially baboons. Having fun so far? I am but I look a little bit ridiculous but I'm trying to stay warm. It is windy out here. Okay, so we've just finished biking five kilometers. Now it is time for our delicious lunch. What do we have? I'm going to enjoy this. We've got a lovely sandwich and Malay macaroni salad. I can't wait for that salad. Yeah, so we're going to fuel up and then keep biking for another six point five kilometers. So we need our energy. Alright, so we have arrived at the Cape of Good Hope. This is the southwestern most point on the African continent. So as you can see over there lots of people snapping their photos. The weather is still not cooperating with us. It is cold, it is wet, it is raining but we're still going to go for a hike so let's go find our guide and get going. Smart phone? Hello? Aaahahaha. Go away! Okay guys, keep all windows locked. They smell food. Wow, she is screaming. Well we didn't spot animals while we were actually on our bikes. But while we were in the vehicle we saw ostriches and we saw baboons. And the baboons were being crazy. One was right on top of a vehicle and a lady freaked out totally. And that concludes our Cape Point tour. The sun is just coming out just as we're about to leave. That is just how it is sometimes. So we have a fun day planned today. We're actually doing a wine tour around Stellenbosch so we're just going to be driving through the countryside sipping on wine. Let's get started. And eating cheese. So we're pairing some white wines with cheese. I don't know which one I'm more excited about. I think maybe the cheese. And this is my favorite cheese so far. It is called White Rock with cranberry. It tastes a little bit like cheesecake. The last sweet red wine we tried tasted a little bit like Christmas cake. It was delicious. Good to the last drop. So we just finished our first wine tasting here at Fairview. We each tried six different wines with cheese. I think we're feeling pretty happy right now aren't we? It is eleven fourteen in the morning right now and I'm already well greased. So we've now arrived at our second vineyard of the day. This one is called Moroti and it has more of a rustic family feel. So let's go check that one out. So this particular vineyard has a lot of character. It has a specially rustic feel. And it has just been cool touring around here. Given some of the areas what appear to be permanent cobwebs. It is pretty amazing. So this is our third vineyard and this particular red wine is straight from the barrel. Oh, take a sip. It's good. And for dessert we are what? Roasting marshmallows. Over an open fire. We're just missing the chocolate and graham crackers. Roasted to perfection. It's hot. Is it good? Delicious? Alright, I get the next one. And here is how I like mine. Nice and crispy all over. That's a mouth full. Alright, so we just finished a delicious braai lunch and we're feeling quite stuffed. But the tour isn't over. We still have two more vineyards to visit and apparently there is Biltong and chocolate on the menu. So I am looking forward to that. They're going to be carrying us away on wheel barrels by the time we're finished. So we are now at our forth vineyard. Everyone is wearing hats. I'm not sure why but we're going to go drink some wine in our fancy hats. We've moved on from cheese to lunch. And now we've got chocolate. And over here I've got a chili chocolate so apparently you don't taste it too much when you're chewing it but when it goes down. When you're swallowing it that is when you really feel the burn. So let's see if that is true. I don't taste it so much now. Maybe take a sip of wine and see what happens. Yeah, as soon as you swallow it you feel the burn. It is not too overpowering but it is. It's got some kick to it for sure. Time for some wine. Do you want neck scratches? You're sweet aren't you? Why are you behind a gate? Huh? You're not dangerous. Are you a guard dog? Are you a guard dog? Those are nice aren't they? Oh, you're getting a puppy massage. Puppy massage. So we have now arrived at our fifth and final winery of the day. To be honest they're all starting to blend together because we've been drinking way too much wine but there is still a little room for a few more glasses so let's go in and sample some more. Alright, so we've had cheese and we've had chocolate with our wine and now it is time for Biltong. Which is a type of South African jerky. This is awesome, high quality, fresh Biltong. Final impressions is that was a fantastic tour. It is actually our very last day in South Africa and I couldn't think of a more relaxing way to finish things off. The wine was fantastic. All of the food was really good. We had some excellent cheeses, chocolate and Biltong and we had a huge feast for lunch, so what a great way to wrap things up and that is it for us in South Africa.",False,20150830 - Things to do in South Africa ∩╜£ Top Attractions Travel Guide To South Africa.en.srt

Its Unesco Heritage cobblestone streets, the Château Frontenac and trendy bistros and cafes offer Old World European charm that simply doesn't exist in any other city in Canada. To really appreciate Québec City you must visit in both the summer and winter. Musicians, actors and acrobats entertain during the summer months. When the temperature drops, Québec’s Winter Carnival offers up a world-class event for people of all ages. You can even stay in the magnificent Ice Hotel. The following is a complete travel guide featuring the top attractions and things to do in Quebec City. If you want to experience a Canadian city with a bit of French flair, then you need to visit Quebec City. Situated on the banks of the St. Lawrence River, this is a town with good looks and a big heart. We only had a day and a half there, but that was enough time to wander the cobbled streets, catch some street performances, and visit many of the top attractions. The following is a little video of our time in historic Quebec City. We are no standing on the Plains of Abraham and this is the location where the battle between the English and the French was fought. This was the battle that ultimately determined the fate of North America. This battle was part of the Seven Years' War and it would be the deciding factor over the fate of New France, influencing the later creation of Canada. We just finished visiting the Citadelle and if you get the chance I would suggest you try to be here by ten in the morning. That is when they have the changing of the guard ceremony and it is a lot of fun to watch. They even have a pet goat that takes part so it really is a lot of fun. The Citadelle is the largest British fortress in North America. Now we're visiting Chateau Frontenac, one of the most famous hotels in all of Canada. It is a stunner. It is just absolutely beautiful. We're trying to capture it from different vantage points. The hotel was designed by American architect Bruce Price. It was one of many ""chÃ¢teau"" style hotels built for the Canadian Pacific Railway company with the goal of promoting luxury tourism. Today, a night at the Frontenac starts at $379 dollars. This boardwalk that we are currently standing on is called Terrasse Dufferin and it is a great place for a stroll. You can catch some street performers, eat some ice cream and you also get some great views of the river below. The promenade sits right outside the Chateau Frontenac and it is 425 meters in length. You can also catch a funicular nearby which takes you to the Old Lower Town. Petit Champlain is a neighbourhood located in the Old Lower Town. It is quite picturesque, especially when viewed from the Breakneck Stairs. The narrow cobbled streets are lined with small shops and cafes. It's a really fun neighborhood to explore with a camera in hand. It is a human car wash. The Basilica Notre Dame de Quebec is the oldest church in the Americas north of Mexico. If you want to get a sneak peek at the crypt, you'll have to sign up for a guided tour. We're now walking along Rue St. Paul and this is a great place to browse for antiques and you can buy some souvenirs. Just don't leave your visit to the end of the day because you may find that a lot of the shops have closed. The Museum of Civilization is a great place to learn about the Aboriginal peoples of Quebec. We're here now in the Port Area. This is a great place to take a ferry. A lot of people come here to exercise, to fish and just to enjoy the views of the St. Lawrence river. It is a really relaxing place. The Port of Quebec is the oldest in all of Canada and it played an important role in developing the region. Today you'll find that cruises have replaced much of the former freight traffic. And lastly, you can't come to Quebec City and not catch a street performance! The city celebrates its performers and you'll often find acts taking place in the town square and parks. Grab a seat for some live entertainment and don't forget to leave a tip at the end! And that concludes our brief but very enjoyable trip to Quebec City! We hope that you enjoyed this video and that it will help inspire your Canadian travels. Welcome to Quebec City! We are here in the winter capital of the world. And it is carnival which means everyone is out embracing the cold and embracing the winter fun. Alright, so what are we doing next? We're going to be doing something I've wanted to do for years. We're going to dog sledding! Woo! Go, puppies go! Steer it. Go, puppies! Good puppies. Come on, puppies. We're going ice fishing. We're going to be catching our lunch today. Ready to fish? I'm ready. I've got my bait. I've got my fishing rod. Let's do this. They ate your bait. They ate it and didn't come up. Let's go get some more. That is not very good fishing. I know. That's really bad fishing. Okay, round two. Let's get ourselves a fish. Oh, we have a fish and I feel kind of bad. We got one. I know I eat fish but I feel a little guilty right now. Now it is time to cook it. Lunch, right here. Just warming up. Here is our catch of the day. This is the big reveal. You can see the steam coming off. That smells really nice. I know, I think they've put seasonings on it. Oh, yeah. That looks good. Have it. Oh, I can't see. The smoke is going in my eyes. Alright, first bite. Mmmm. How is it? That's amazing. Can you look at the camera? They put some onions and spices inside and a little bit of butter. It's really good. I think it is time for a romantic sleigh ride for two. So right now we're getting ready to go inside Bonhomme's ice palace. Let's go visit him. I even once went to Mexico. It's a little bit warm. When I got there I was about eight feet as I am usually and when I came back I was five foot four. I melted a little bit. Is that a video? Let's do something memorable. Audrey. And you're from? Kingston, right? Okay. Hello, my friends from Kingston. We're with Audrey right now. We invite you to come to the biggest winter carnival in the world in Quebec City. I love you all and wish you a Joyeux Carnaval. I love you all and wish you a Joyeux Carnaval. Merci. Bye, bye. Bye, Bohomme. Merci. I don't know about you but I'm getting hungry. It's time for a Beavertail. It looks like a few other people have the same idea. They have a Reese's pieces beavertail. I think that is the one I'm getting. Oh my, what do we have here? Reese's pieces Beavertail with chocolate and peanut butter and a hot chocolate because I really need to warm up. Show me that Reese's Pieces Beavertail. Oh, my gosh that looks amazing. I wish I could capture the smell on video. Alright, let's take a big bite of that. And? That's hitting the spot right now. That's really good. No. Yeah. Go Max. Way to go Max. Go Max. Sam wanted a horn to toot. Alright, unfortunately all things come to an end. We've had an absolutely marvelous day out here at the carnaval. It's been so memorable. Now it's time to go home and warm up. Faster, horses! Faster! And how is the ice princess this morning? Doing very well. This morning we are heading in to the Old City. We're going to do a bit of a walking tour on our own. Let's head into town and check it out. We are about to enter the old city. There are real benefits to waking up early on a Sunday morning. We've practically got the old part of the city to ourselves. And what a different feel. In the summer it had a totally different vibe and now in the winter it's like an entirely new city to explore. So I just noticed there are railings all along the street and I think it is because it is so steep and it gets so icy in the wintertime that if they didn't have these babies people would just be sliding all the way down. Well, we've been sliding a lot anyways. Yes. So it is kind of cool being here in the winter because even though it is February it still feels like Christmas never left. Like we still have Christmas trees, Christmas lights, lots of red. So it feels very festive. Absolutely. We found a little place where to warm up. There is a little outdoor fireplace. It is our own personal fire place. And we really need it after all that walking. Put your legs up by the fire. It's a dragon! It's a snow dragon! A fire breathing dragon. Alright, it is time to warm up. Let's go for a hot chocolate and maybe even a cupcake. Yum yum. Lead the way. How is that hot chocolate? Mmmm. That is so good after that really really cold walk. Alright, it's time to lick your lips. You've got cream all over your face. There you go. That's some kind of classic Canadian food. Here we've got Nanaimo bars. Audrey is digging in. Very Canadian. Let's have that first bite. Mmmm. Sweet enough for you? It's such a nice breakfast. And I've got fudge and Bonhomme de Carnaval. And this guy has been really nice to me but unfortunately I'm going to have to take a bite out of his head. Sorry, Bonhomme. Does he taste good? He does. What do you have over there? And the last indulgence of the day - we've got pure maple sugar fudge. I'm not surprised you would go for that. You're always looking for fudge wherever we go. I don't have anything to say - it's just pure bliss. Now if you can believe it we were bonkers enough to be doing ice canoeing out in the Saint Lawrence with those massive chunks of ice. It was just one of the craziest things we've ever done. We can't wait to show you that video as well. So now we're working our way up to the Chateau Frontenac. That means climbing a lot of steps. I'm already out of breath. We still have a few more to go. Lead the way. It's a little steep and slippery over here. I almost feel like I could go snowboarding. Do it. Do it. And the concludes our walking tour of Old Quebec. Now we're going to head back to our hotel, warm up a little bit and get ready to do some more exploring in the afternoon. We are in a winter wonderland today also known as the Ice Hotel here in Quebec City. Let me take you in. Have a seat while you wait to be checked in. The vortex of time! Welcome to the Spa. This is where you come to warm up right before going to bed. Or when you need to pee. It looks like a sauna in there. Woah. We're going to ride the grand slide. If you don't fall down first. We're going to enter the bar and drink in glasses made of ice. What do you got in your hands? Vodka cranberry. Mmmmm. And my lips didn't get stuck because they prepared the ice a very special way. I couldn't tell you how but it is a special way. Cheers! Salut! Welcome to the Medieval chamber. I slept here two weeks ago. What happened? I survived. I'm alive. Hey, you're here. And well! So basically like I told my husband I looked like a beached whale. Okay. Because you're in your sleeping bag except first of all you go in the saunas, you go in the spas to warm up and then afterwards you go inside and there is a whole section towards the indoor pavilion reserved completely only for our roomed night guests. Where they have locker rooms, lockers for their stuff, etc. So once you're done with the spa and the sauna you go inside and you dry off and then you put on what you're going to need to sleep. And it is basically a little spandex thing or it has to be artificial like fleece. It has to be artificial, not artificial but synthetic fibers. Nothing cotton. So no white socks. Like I'm wearing right now. Basically, you then come into your room. Access is from nine PM to nine AM. We don't give out rooms. We don't do early check ins or late checkouts. Okay, because we have visitors. All of our clients have to mingle well throughout. So basically we arrive in your room and there are two candles or a fire place going and it is to take the humidity out. The fireplace obviously there is no heat. We would have a meltdown. Okay. The sleeping bags are in huge pouches and they're thermal sleeping bags. You are basically looking like a Mummy. Okay. Then you get on the bed. This is the fun part. You get on the bed, you get in to your liner of your sleeping bag and then you get in the sleeping bag and then they tell you you have to change your pair of socks. You're like really? I'm like mummified in this thing and you're standing and you're like this. So basically I went down, I then put on a change of socks while you're in the sleeping bag, there is absolutely no humidity and then you mummify yourself. You're all zipped up. This was me. This was my husband. Okay. It's true. My husband, I could only see his nose. I'm like man you snore. Zip that thing back up. It didn't work. If you're all quiet there is no sound. It is phenomenal to sleep here. You go to bed around midnight and then we wake up people at eight in the morning because you're sleeping that much. Now you're going to say Majole, what about the three AM pee pee? Well, it does happen. We all have to go sometimes. And now you're entering into my private bubble. But at five thirty in the morning I've got to go pee. Whether I'm in Vancouver, whether I'm in Quebec City five thirty my alarm clock goes. So my husband and I we said whoever wakes up at night, whoever needs to go pee wakes the other up saying honey do you want to come with me to the bathroom? So when I woke my husband up at five thirty he's like I don't think so you're going alone. The only iffy part is the three seconds you put your boots back on. That's the only thing that was cold because you're leaving it outside. You don't put anything on any ice. I didn't put my glasses on the ice because it would go in. Literally. Okay, you put everything in your boots or in the pouch. So basically in your sleeping bag pouch. Your coat, you open it up, you put it on your bed and then you're sleeping on top. So it gets your body heat. Inside your thermal sleeping bag it goes up to twenty four degrees. At one point you're in the night unzipped everything and I needed to breathe. I really, it's a good thing that there are showers here in the morning. That could also be a sign of hypothermia you know? No, but it was really everybody you're really hot. The minute you unzip you see the vapor coming out. Okay. It is a sleep that you cannot have anywhere else. The oxygen that you're breathing in is phenomenal. And we couldn't leave without checking out the maple sugar shack. You lead the way. Well, I didn't come away empty handed. Check out this. I've got two different maple syrup products. All dressed and ready to go? Oh, yeah. Taping them on. So you look a little bit ridiculous. I feel like a robot. And you look like a robot. But these are actually our outfits to go ice canoeing, so we've got special socks, special boots and hockey pads. I'm so excited to try ice canoeing. This is as Canadian as it gets. These are large, medium, small. My shoes. Can you stand up? For a second. Put your feet like this. Like that on the toe. Yeah. So we have a super exciting morning today. We are out here in Quebec City and we are going to be going ice canoeing. All geared up. Practicing in the snow but we're going to be hitting the ice soon. So we officially survived ice canoeing on the Saint Lawrence River. If you can have a look behind me you'll be able to see what exactly we were trying to canoe in. I mean it is a combination of ice, a bit of water, chucks of icebergs. It's crazy! One of the most exciting events of Quebec's Winter Carnival was the ice canoe race. This event is exactly what it sounds like. Teams hit the frigid waters of the Saint Lawrence river with their canoes and race through a mix of ice, slush and water. Originally, a means of winter transport, ice canoeing has become a sport for the bold and brave. Having had the chance to try this ourselves we had some serious respect for the teams competing. Here is a look at this legendary event. Alright, the big moment we've been waiting for - the Carnival parade. Everyone is out and we're all bundled up. Let's get this party started. Chicken noodle soup. Trying to stay warm. Is that chicken soup? It's time to toot my horn.

I've been to countries like Korea and Thailand where street food reigns supreme. Arriving in Lima, Peru I wasn't sure what to expect. Well, I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised. Peruvian street food is some of the best in all of Latin American. In fact, one cannot really say they've sampled Peruvian cuisine without trying favorites served up on street corners. Some of the Peruvian street food we tried includes Churros, Picarones, Turron, Tejas, Cremoladas, Alfajores and Chicha Morada to name just a few. If you've got a sweet tooth you'll find your taste-buds are in heaven over here. The following is our Peruvian food guide to the best street food in Lima. So today we're going to be trying something called Alfajores. And this is something you can find throughout South America but it varies from country to country. So today we're having Peruvian Alfajores, so I'm going to open the box for a big reveal. And we've ordered a few different varieties. Wow, that looks awesome. We're very used to the Argentinian ones. Yeah. So what I've found particularly fascinating upon researching Alfajores is that it has Arabic origins. Then it made its way to Spain and now it has become immensely popular all over South America. Right, so this is the original which I'm going to be trying first. So it is basically two layers of a crumbly cookie. Let's zoom in on that. It has. You can zoom in. It has Manjar Blanco in the middle which is kind of like Dulce De Leche. It is a milk caramel. It is very sweet. And then it has like a white powdery sugar like icing sugar on top. It looks like a very generous amount of the dulce de leche. So this is a miniature version of the original Alfajor And it is what I'm trying first. Bite sized. Mmmm. Those are really nice. Up to standard? Mmmm. Nice and sugary. I think it would be nice for breakfast or for a little snack. Heck, maybe even dinner. I could see you eating that for dinner. You like your sweets. It is really nice. Alright, I'm also going to have the original one. And Alfajores kind of have a special place in my heart because during our wedding one of the things we made together as a family with Audrey's family is a huge batch of Alfajores which we ate of course and shared to our guests. So high expectations here and it does have some positive memories for me as well. Mmmm. One big bite. That's pretty good. Okay, so I'm interested in having this one next because it looks like chocolate. Let's hold that up. I'll zoom in. Oh yeah, it's got a chocolate layer. Okay. I'm trying to figure out what the filling is. Do you think it might be a dark fruit of some sort kind? Maybe like a plum. Not a plum but a date. A date filling? I think. No, it's chocolate-y. I think maybe they took the Manjar Blanco that we had for the other one and just added some chocolate and mixed it together. That would be my guess. And the cookie is chocolate. How does it compare to the original? I think I prefer the original personally. But this is nice as well, it is very tasty. And mysterious. So you got a little excited about the next one. Well, we were shooting a photo for our cover photo image of this video and I just got a little carried away. I was just planning on having my teeth on it but my brain. My subconscious brain took over and basically forced me to have a bite. Okay, first 'unofficial bite' over here. Yeah, that is really nice. It kinds of reminds me of the original Alfajor but the big difference here is that it has a crunchier exterior and if you see over on this side it is covered in what appears to be walnuts. How about the cookie dough? Does it also have nuts? Is it crunchy? Yeah, it is definitely crunchier than the original one which is more like a thin cookie. Alright, and then we are down to one. The one and only lonely one. So it is my turn. I believe this one has honey. That is what I was told. It looks sticky. It looks big. Oh, my gosh. Look at that. Okay, it is like a triple one. So triple layered Alfahor. Dude, it is spilling all over the place. Let's get a really good zoom in on that. Like that is just...woah. That is some serious, serious topping overflow there. And the taste? Well, that is not your average honey that is for sure. It's really thick and sticky. I've had it in a few other Peruvian desserts but I still don't know what it is made out of. Yeah, it has a stronger flavor than regular honey. Would you care to have a bite and tell me your thoughts? Maybe you can decipher the great mystery. Alright, the things that Audrey makes me do. The things I do in front of the camera. Oh my gosh. I'm just kidding. This is awesome. First bite here. Woah, I probably should have had a smaller bite. Yeah, that kind of reminds me of the Turron sauce honey. I have a feeling that maybe it mixed with some kind of date or possibly a kind of marmalade because yeah it just doesn't have a pure honey taste in my opinion. So we picked up this little goodie box from La Casa Del Alfajor which translates to the house of the Alfajor. And a yeah, it was a great little goodie box but I guess what sort of surprised me was that I ended up liking the original the most. How about you? Same. Loved the original. So I guess the take home message for today is don't mess with that awesome classic good flavor. So this afternoon we're at a place called Cremoladas Curich. Yep, got the name right and we're trying a kind of like icy cold dessert called Cremolada. And basically this is shaved ice, finely shaved ice and then it is topped with like a juice or a syrup that has like a tropical fruit flavor. So I've chosen Chicha Morada which is a purple corn. And Sam over here has chosen Lucuma. So we're going to being try these. Very local flavours. Oh, yeah. Very much so. Just mixing it around. Ice cold. Purple goodness. Ready for my first bite. This is purple corn. Mmmm. It tastes. It doesn't taste like corn. It tastes more like syrup. Purple syrup? I mean, like what would you call this back at home? It that like a kind of a slushie. A slushie! There you go. It's a slushie. So I'm having a purple corn slushie. Do you actually like it? So, so? Yeah, I mean it is ice. Flavored ice. It's okay. What can I say. So I've got something called lÃºcuma. And it is a local fruit which I've kind of fallen in love with since being in Peru. I mean you can't really describe what a fruit tastes like. A mango tastes like a mango, a peach tastes like a peach, and a lucuma tastes like a lucuma. So let's try it here. It is definitely sweet. It has that sweet tropical taste, so I can say that. This one seems really thick. I really like that. I have a feeling that mine is quite a bit thicker than yours. If you just look down at it here you can see that it is really thick. And you can really taste the fruit. It has definitely been sweeten but it is not overpowering. The fruit tastes really comes out so I'm actually really enjoying this right now. So it is nothing out of the ordinary but if you're in Lima on a really hot day this is definitely a very refreshing little slushie drink and in terms of costs. Those buses! In terms of costs it was five Soles and seventy cents which is less than two dollars. So not a bad deal. It is actually kind of getting chilly here so I'm cold eating this. I can't believe you're wearing a sweater. I'm wearing a t-shirt and shorts and I think this is perfect weather. So it is time to get back home before Audrey suffers from hypothermia. You know it is only like twenty-five degrees outside or something. Pish posh. It must be like eighteen and I'm freezing. So today we are on a food mission. We are looking for a place called Manolo and we're going to be eating some Churros. Let's go eat. So getting there is half the journey. Now the other half is going to be eating it. And here we are - Manolo's! So we went all out here and got one of each. So this is the one with chocolate, vanilla and dulce de leche. Talk about a trio. I know. Just for me. So in case you've never tried Churro before it is just a deep-fried dough with like a hole in the middle so I guess you can fill it up with something really sweet and tasty. So the one I'm having right now has dulce de leche. Mmmm. Oh my gosh, that's warm and gooey and sweet. So do you think it is fresh out of the oven? Oh, it definitely is. Wow! Decisions, decisions, decisions. The decisions I have to make in life. Okay, I'll go with chocolate. Mmmmm. His eyes are closed. That's a good sign. You're totally right about it being freshly made. I can taste the warm gooeyness of that chocolate inside. You're not getting a bite of that. Last but not least, Vanilla! Mmmm. It is like a vanilla pudding or like the filling you get inside the Boston cream donuts. Mmmm. I still think I like this one better though - Dulce De Leche. It's my number one. So that was a very delicious snack and it wasn't very expensive at all. I lost my receipt but I think I paid somewhere near twelve Soles which would be around four dollars for those three very tasty, very sweet churros. Highly recommended. So seriously, it is probably a good idea that we're walking home right now. I honestly could have had about five more of those dulce de leche churros. And we've got more food videos coming soon. Well, Hello there! So this afternoon we are at Parque Kennedy and we are here for some dessert. We've been eating like pigs all day long but there is still a bit of room left for a little something sweet, so we're going to try Picarones. Look at this - I already have a bee following me because of the honey. Isn't that amazing? Woah. And we thought about getting two orders. Haha. This will be plenty. Alright, so here we have our dessert. These are Picarones and they are like fried rings. Fried dough made with sweet potato and pumpkin and they have a sweet honey drizzled all over. And they're uniquely Peruvian cuisine. Oh, yes. So I'm just going to go for it and take a bite. Dig right in. Mmmmm. These are so fresh. Wow. Really fluffy and airy. Can you taste that honey? Oh, yeah. I sure can. And like they are so light I've already finished half of one. I understand why they give you five. You can just devour them in a few minutes. And we've got a guest who is interested as well. Hi, Kitty. Hello, Mr. Meowzers. So as I mentioned previously, this is a uniquely Peruvian dish. And as such there isn't an English equivalent. I suppose we could call it a Peruvian doughnut with honey. And so that is what we're going with. And this is my first bite. My first time to ever try this so I am really excited. I am sopping it up in honey. Woo Hoo!. Honey syrup. Let's try this. Oh my gosh. That is so good. You know what it reminds me of? It kind of reminds me of a oversaturated waffle with maple syrup or honey. It's like where you pour like three times as much as you actually need on the waffle and then you eat it. This is what it tastes like right here. Mmmm. I don't mess around when I eat food. What can I say. So this tasty dessert only cost us five Soles. That would be one sole for each donut that we've already eaten. That is pretty affordable actually with the exchange rate it would be about a dollar seventy-five and you do get a lot of food for that. So if you're looking to pair this sweet treat with a little beverage you can get something called Chicha which is a purple corn juice that goes perfectly with it. So there are five of these but only two of us. So who gets that third one? We split it down the middle Sam. Oh, I don't agree with that. Sleepy kitty. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. There are hundreds of cats in this park. Look here is another one. Meow. Meow. That was a delicious sweet treat and we're going to be back at this park again very soon to film some more street food. So this afternoon we are at the Love Park here in Lima and we're going to be doing yet another taste test. We're trying something that is called Tejas and Chocotejas. This is a dessert that comes from Ica and there are two different varieties. So first up we're going to be trying Tejas, which is a sweet. The exterior is covered in white sugar and then the inside has something inside called Manjar Blanco which is similar to Dulce de Leche which is like a milky caramel. It is really sweet. Some of them are filled with nuts, filled with different fruits, so we're going to try one. So I'm first up here with the pecan Tejas. You can see over here. Pecanas. I think according to you this should be white. It should be. Oh, Wow it is. It should be coated in white sugar. Wow! It's almost got that sliminess. Oh my gosh, I'm getting my hands all sticky. I think that is because I put it in the fridge. It really shouldn't be slimey. Okay. Oh my gosh. That is so sweet. Tasty. Show us what it looks like? It is just loaded with sugar. It's almost like eating icing with caramel inside and nuts of course. Pecans. Mmmm. I really like this. So next up I'm trying a Chocotejas, so unlike Sam's which was coated in a white sugar the chocotejas is actually coated in chocolate like the name suggests. And this one is lemon flavoured. And you know what? It is a different shape. Yeah, it is more like. It looks like more of a square. Let's take a bite. Mmmmmm. I was expecting it to be really sour because of the lemon but it is really not. It is still really sweet, so you have the Manjar Blanco, which is the caramel. I'm just going to zoom in on that. And then you can kind of see the lemon. It is like the lemon skin and they've turned it into a kind of marmalade. And yeah, it is not sour at all. This is great. I like it. So next up I'm having Chocolate Tejas con leche con mani. And mani means peanuts, so I'm excited about this one. Just judging by touching it right now this one is even slimier than the one before. Okay, it was in the fridge. Whoops. Just trying to break that off so I don't have any paper on it. And again this shape is different from the two we've tried previously. So I like my peanuts so I have high expectations. Oh man, that is like a Snicker's bar on steroids. That is like so so tasty. Really good quality chocolate and just a massive generous amount of caramel. And then you've got the great big peanuts that I'm biting into too, so I mean this for me is about as close as it gets to being a perfect chocolate bar. And last but not least we have one called chocotejas pasas borrachas. And pasas borachas means drunk raisins so I'm assuming they've been soaked in some kind of alcohol. We like our drunk food. So let's unveil. We sure do like our drunk food. There we have it. Okay, it is chocolate covered. I haven't found any raisins yet. No drunkenness? No, raisins. Oh, okay at the bottom. Show me. I think there is some kind of raisin paste. Oh, no there is a raisin. Show me. Where? Oh, we found it. We discovered the raisin. There we go. So you've got to take a bite with the raisin now. Come on, do it properly. Oh, that's a drunk raisin for sure. That's been soaked in alcohol for a long time. Like drunk drunk? Partying all night long raisin? I would say so, yeah. It's really good. I think this is actually my favorite one so far. Alright, to wrap things up. What I really liked about those was that each and every one was really unique and different. Not only in shape but in taste and texture. Some of them reminded me of fudge whereas others reminded me more of eating like a chocolate turtle. And in terms of pricing each of those costs 3 Soles and 50 cents, so perhaps a little pricy in terms of a small treat but it was gourmet chocolate with the best of ingredients. Now to take footage of the guy on the tightrope. So we thought we were going to be ending that video with the food but we've got some paragliding to show you. So we are back at our favourite park once again. This is Parque Kennedy and we are here for dessert. What else. So today we are going to be sampling something that is called TurrÃ³n. So part of reason we like coming here are all of the cats. There must be hundreds of them and they are so friendly. They just want to be scratched and petted. Look there is another one coming up right behind you. Oh, Hello. Hello, cat. Look at you. You're a sweet one. You're still a kitten. Oh, it is sitting on me. I've made a new friend. Hi, Cat. Hello, cat. So what have you got over here? Okay, so we ended up getting two different things. This is called Turrone. And over here, oh my goodness, it already got stuck to my leg. This giant thing over here is called Torreja. So they look kind of different but they are both actually made with the same ingredients. So all this is is deep-fried flower and then they drizzle honey over top. Sounds good enough to me? Yeah. Let's try it. The first bite. The first bite. Big moment here. Here we go. It looks sticky. I think you bit off a little more than you can chew there. This is interesting. It's getting stuck to my teeth. A little difficult to talk right now but the honey kind of has an orange flavor to it. And also it is a lot stickier than honey. I wonder if it is more of a marmalade. Kind of an orange marmalade. Do you think, maybe? Maybe. They told me honey but I don't know. No honey for the bunny. Mmmm. It is nice. Really crsipy. The dough itself is really not really very flavorful because I mean it is just flour but the honey that is what you can taste. The orange flavoured honey. Want to have some? Alright, it is my turn. Oh, you can take a bigger bite than that. I don't want to get all of that sticky stuff all over my face. We don't have any napkins out here. This probably looks more like French Fries with like ketchup drizzled all over them but in fact this is the second dessert we're going to be trying. And I've noticed since we've come to Lima that cakes and other things tend to have these little doughy bits. Crunchy doughy bits and so let's try it here. Like I don't see myself breaking it off with my hand. I'm just going to take a bite. Mmmm. That is good. You know what, I think I actually prefer this one to the big pizza shaped one I had. Similar flavour to the previous one. More or less the same thing. Just kind of slightly different. You know what? It kind of tastes like Fruit Loops. When you really chew on it for a while it is like really sugary Fruit Loops. Maybe that is why we like it so much. We grew up eating Fruit Loops. Fruit Loops guys. Fruit Loops. Peruvian Fruit Loops. So how much did today's dessert cost? Well, this was probably our cheapest street food / dessert that we've had since we've come to Peru. This one came to three Soles each. So that is a dollar for each of those delicious little snacks we had. So you know, if you're on a budget you can really load up on those. So we're just going to go for a little walk around the park and then we're going to head home for more food. Whal else. All we do is eat. Meow, meow, meow. Oh, look at that. Meow, meow, meow little kitty. You're a cute one aren't you. Oh, it is purring. I can feel it purring. Hi Kitty.

This is a city where I was born, so it is always really fun to come and revisit. We are going to be showing you some of the main attractions around town. For our summer getaway we decided to visit Montreal. Located in the province of Quebec, this city offers world class festivals, arts, entertainment and dining. We wanted to highlight what makes this city so special, so here are 30 things to do in Montreal. Our first stop was the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts for a look at some of the current exhibitions. One of the nice things about this museums is that admission to the permanent collection is free at all times. Well, it is time to burn off all of that Poutine. We're here at Park Mount Royal and we're going to walk around and explore to see what is going on. This is one of the biggest parks in the city. We just spotted a woodpecker up in the tree. This is where locals come to escape the bustle of the city. You'll find many people picnic-ing here on a weekend. We've been walking around Mount Royal for a while now and we've finally reached one of the many lookout points of the city and there are some amazing views. On a clear day you can see the whole city. During our visit to Montreal we chose to stay in the neighborhood of Le Plateau-Mont Royal. The area is quite lively with lots of bars and restaurants, and the residential streets are lined with spiral staircases. There were also lots of friendly cats who came out to greet us in the morning. Summers in Montreal are a lot of fun. On Sunday afternoons you'll find a huge drumming circle on the east end of Mount Royal. We're now here at McGill University, one of Canada's oldest and most prestigious universities. It is a gorgeous day outside so we're just going to wander around campus and show you around. McGill University is one of the most prestigious universities in all of Canada. Even if you're not a student, the campus is worth a little stroll. There is one dish that you absolutely have to try when you come to Montreal and that is poutine. This is a French Canadian dish and for those who aren't very familiar with it. It is basically french fries with gravy and cheese curds on top. Now it sounds a little bit gross and it doesn't look that appetizing at first sight but trust me it is delicious. It is time for the big reveal. Look down here. This is the standard one. Look at all of the cheese curd. It is melting. And the gravy. These fries are swimming in a pool of gravy. That is amazing. Time for the first bite of the classic poutine here. Let's get lots of gravy on it. Woah, stringy cheese. Oh, I got it on my mouth. Wow! That is so good. I just wish this was healthy so that I could eat it more often. For a taste of French charm, wander down the cobbled streets of Old Montreal. It'll feel like you've traveled back to France several centuries. There are lots of great restaurants to try in this area. For fine dining and shopping in trendy boutiques, you can pop into the Bonsecours Market. Habitat 67 is a unique housing complex and one of the most interesting architectural landmarks in the city. Whether you visit Montreal in the summer or winter, there are always festivals going on. Be sure to check them out! Tonight we're at the Cirque du Soleil here in Montreal and we're going to be watching their latest show Curious. While we can't bring you inside the tent, we can tell you that it is a fascinating performance that takes you into a different world. This roman catholic basilica is located on the Westmount Summit and you'll have to climb 283 steps to reach the top. The biodome is a popular attraction for families with children. It allows you to walk through replicas of four ecosystems found in the Americas. We're here now at Olympic Stadium. This used to be the former stadium of the Montreal Expos, a baseball team that has since moved to Washington. I was fortunate enough in the 90's to come and watch them play when they had such great players such as Larry Walker who is considered to be by many the best Canadian baseball player ever. Originally though this stadium was built for the Olympics in the 70's and this is still the largest stadium in Canada in terms of seating capacity. Because there was some landscaping work being done, we didn't get to walk the extent of the gardens, however, there is plenty to see here. The botanical gardens are home to Japanese Gardens, Chinese Gardens and even Alpine Gardens. Right now I'm here at the Bell Center, home to the Montreal Canadiens, one of the most historic and celebrated franchises in all of sports - not just in the NHL but all of sports. They have such a storied history but as a Blackhawks fan my team has been doing better lately so I've got bragging rights right now. You have to eat smoked meat if you come all the way to Montreal and there's not better place to do so that at Schwartz. This restaurant is an institution and it's worth lining up for. The Notre Dame Basilica is located in the historic district of Old Montreal. Step inside to be wowed by the blue ceilings and gold-adorned altar. If you enjoy checking out graffiti and street art I would highly recommend the area around Saint Catherine's in the East end of the city. It is just so colorful. You can wander down the lanes. So many artists have taken over the area, so check it out. Next up we're heading to St. Catherine street which is the place to go shopping. The street is lined with different stores and boutiques and I know Sam is going to love this. This is the main commercial artery of the city. Montreal has long, brutal winters and this is when the underground city plays an important role. Most of the downtown area is interconnected by underground paths and underground shopping areas so you don't have to be out in the cold. Parc Lafontaine is located in the borough of Le Plateau Mont-Royal and it's a popular hangout spot on weekends. Friends come to play sports and enjoy a picnic by the pond. Le Village is a vibrant neighbourhood which is home to many bars, clubs, and theatres. In the summertime the street is lined with 200,000 pink balls over the pedestrian only street. So now for a little afternoon pick me up we have St. Viateur bagels, which are really famous here in Montreal. I got myself the cinnamon raisin one. That smells really nice. What makes these bagels unique is that they are hand rolled and they are made in a wood burning oven. This store is so popular that they actually produce twelve thousand bagels a day. Alright, time for the first bite. I don't know if you can see it well with the camera but there are huge chunks of apples. Look at that. Wow! Are you in your happy place? I am. This is like ultimate dessert for me. A great way to get around the city is by bike. Bixi stations let you hire out bikes for a few hours or for the full day, and you can return them at any bike station in the city. This is another popular cathedral in the city. It is the third largest church in the province of Quebec. Montreal's Old Port is worth a wander. You can enjoy a quiet stroll along the waterfront or stop for a mid-afternoon nap and one of the many little parks found in the area. The best way to get around Montreal is by hopping on the metro. If you're going to be in the city for a few days we suggest you get a pass so that you can zip around from one neighborhood to the next. This Canal is popular with cyclists. It runs 14.5 kilometers starting from the Old Port of Montreal. So there you have it - a quick little glimpse at this beautiful French city. From festivals to live entertainment, and dining to shopping, Montreal has plenty to offer for travellers. Hey guys, as part of my plan to embrace winter while being back in Canada, I'm in Montreal for the weekend. And this is the view from the guesthouse I'm staying at in the Latin Quarter area. I'm stoked about going outside. I'm going to be doing all kinds of crazy stuff today. Hopefully some dog sledding, snowshoeing and maybe some skating. I'm also going to be devouring poutine and I can't wait to show you what a cool city Montreal is in the wintertime. It is seriously cold out today guys. I'm all bundled up but apparently with windchill it is almost minus thirty. Woo hoo! Check out those icicles. I'm starting to get some on my beard. I don't know if you can see it or not? I'm at Parc Lafontaine and there is just this incredible skating rink. Outdoors skating rink. And nobody is out here using it. If only I had my skates. What a fool for me not to bring them. I can't believe I didn't bring them. Oh, this is the best. There is a guy out there with his dog just gliding along the ice with his boots. He doesn't actually have skates on. Look at him sliding out there. That's awesome. I'm in serious need of some comfort food to warm up. It's time to head over for my morning poutine brunch. Oh, my precious - La Banquise - open twenty four seven for all your poutine needs. Now comes the hard part. There is such an extensive menu here that I don't know even know which one to choose. It is just seriously so nice to be warming up right now. My toes were starting to freeze, my beard as all frosty. This comfort food is going to do wonders for me. I think it is going to allow me to go outside and play around in the snow all day long. Oh my, the moment I've been waiting for. Everything I expected and more. La Banquise has the best poutine in Montreal. Woah, that seriously did not last long - pure gluttony over here. So this is one of the more unique entrances I've ever seen towards a subway station. Mickey Mouse is in the house. Hey guys, my life would not be complete without a Montreal bagel. Okay, now the million dollar question is should I go for a bagel sandwich or just go with spread on a bagel? Decisions, decisions. Alright, it's a raisin cinnamon bagel and apple cinnamon cream cheese for the win. Alright guys, time for the first bite. Mmmm. Amazing. So it appears we've got some snow cricket going on over hear. It doesn't get too much more Canadian than this. Oh. Yes, yes! Alright, it is time to complete the trifecta of must have foods when you're in Montreal. I'm going for - of course - a smoked meat sandwich. And when you want the best you come to Schwartz's. Seriously it pays to come here in the winter. The is the first time I've ever been here where there hasn't been a massive lineup. Now that really hit the spot. One thing to keep in mind when eating at these popular restaurants in MontrÃ©al is that some of them are cash only. You can only pay with cash. Some allow debit card but very few take credit card. Now it is time to burn some calories guys. It is kind of embarrassing thing for me to admit is that I consumed most of those calories within a two hour period. I'm at Mount Royal Park right now and there are all kinds of people doing totally different types of exercises from snowshoeing to cross country skiing to skating. So this is the reward for the long climb up Mount Royal. I'm near the top of the peak here and there is going to be some spectacular views. I just know it. And the last stop of the day is at FÃªte des neiges de MontrÃ©al. There is one dish you absolutely have to try when you come to Montreal and that is Poutine. This is a French Canadian dish and for those who aren't very familiar with it, it is basically french fries with gravy and cheese curds on top. Now it sounds a little bit gross and it doesn't look that appetizing at first sight but trust me it is delicious. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this meal from a nutritional standpoint. It is pure grease and no better way for us to sample it than in this park right here. We went to one of the most famous restaurants in Montreal for Poutine - La Banquise – and in this bag here I've got two different kinds. One is the regular poutine and one is the premium kind. We're going to show you what is inside. It is time for the big reveal. Look down here. This is the standard one. Oh, look at all of the cheese curd. It is melting. And the gravy. It is like these fries are swimming in a pool of gravy. That is amazing. You've got a premium kind. What did you get? I went for something a little bit fancier and mine has bacon and goat cheese instead of the regular cheese curds. Alright, let's open this. Oh, wow! Look at that goat cheese. This is going to be amazing. This is the kind of meal we're going to have to walk off for hours and hours and hours upon end. Look at that cheese. My goodness. First bite of the fancy poutine. That is just as good as imagined it would be. The goat cheese is warm, it is gooey, it is soft and the bacon is amazing. It is greasy, salty. It is amazing! How about the gravy? Mmmmm. Time for the first bite of the classic poutine here. Let's get lots of gravy on it. Woah, stringy cheese! I got it all over my mouth. Wow! That is so good. I just wish this was healthy so I could eat it more often. It is like a heart attack on a plate. We've been having this every day since we've been to Montreal and I don't see us stopping until we leave. Out of the two poutines that we had, my favorite of course was the one with goat cheese and bacon because those ingredients are just stellar. Even if you don't like bacon there is a whole variety of toppings that you can choose over at La Banquise. There are mushrooms, green peppers, hot chilly and anything that you can think of. So how much does a poutine cost? The regular one was just under seven dollars and the premium one was about nine bucks, so it is quite an affordable meal. I'm really excited right now. Montreal smoked meat along with things such as Poutine, is something you absolutely have to try when you're in Montreal. I'm going to go sample a sandwich right now. Montreal smoked meat is made from brisket and the meat is allowed to cure for one week with peppercorn and lots of other spices. It is really flavorful by the end of that week. I'm going to take a bite over here. Let's see what this tastes like. Wow, look at all of that meat. Oh my, this is falling apart and it smells great. You can see the mustard as well. Look at that. Oh my, oh my gosh. Keep that sandwich together there. Okay, I'm going to need a huge napkin after this. Wow. Oh my gosh. That is so tasty. The meat is really juicy and tender. It is served on rye bread with mustard and I just love that combination. Really simple flavors, the meat is smokey and it is great. Look at that massive piece of meat. The thing is a bohemoth. I can barely keep it together in my hands. It is time for my first bite. It is so tender and delicious. That is one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. There is one establishment in Montreal that is really well known for its smoked meat. That is a little deli placed Schwartz's and it has been around since the 1920's. However, that is not the only place where you can get smoked meat. There is actually restaurants and little shops across town that serve almost the exact same recipe, so it is not difficult to track it down. In a place that specializes for Montreal smoked meat, such as Schwartz's, you can order it lean cut, medium or fatty. We've tried a few different ones and medium is our favorite so far. Some of the popular side orders that you can also get with your smoked meat sandwich include poutine, french fries or pickles. For a typical smoked meat sandwich in Montreal you are looking at roughly six to eight dollars and it is well worth the price to try.",False,"20150615 - Visit MONTREAL City Guide ∩╜£ What to SEE, DO & EAT in Montreal, Canada.en.srt"

Edinburgh Edinburgh Edinburgh Edinburgh So we still don't quite know how to pronounce the name of the city. As a Canadian, I would be saying Edinburgh but I keep hearing the locals saying Edinburgh, so that's what we are going to go with for the rest of our videos. Well, as you can probably tell we're not in Kansas anymore and by Kansas I mean Chiang Mai, Thailand. Look at what we're wearing. In our winter clothes. Today we're exploring Edinburgh for the first time. This is our first impressions video. Background music playing. The views of the castle are phenomenal from here. It's time to go climb up for an even better vantage point. And to get there we're going to Granny's Green steps. Background music playing. Screw this hat. I've got myself a proper Scottish winter trapper. More like I've inherited his hat. Background music playing. I'm feeling the Christmas spirit here in Edinburgh. Background music playing. To go on the Ferris Wheel it's going to be a ten minute ride and hopefully we'll some nice views of the city. And we are moving. Woo hoo! And we're only half way there. We're going to even go higher up. Are you scared? Yes, and we're not even at the top yet. We don't like heights at all. We're probably using up all of our courage points doing this. Oh, yes. All for the viewers right? Background music playing. Well there has been a lot of ginger sightings here in Edinburgh. I fit right in. Background music playing. Background music playing. It's our first meal in Scotland, so we've decided to go with something very typical. We're going to be eating the National dish, which is Haggis. So let's go into Whisky Room. So today's meal is all about Haggis. We are starting with Haggis spring rolls. So let's see what those are like. We've had a lot of spring rolls lately in Thailand, Vietnam and other places in SE Asia. Mmmmmm. Never Haggis. And it's also the first time trying haggis. Oh, so hot! Is it hot? Mmmmmm. I'm pleasantly surprised. Oh, yeah. Haggis is good people! Those are hot. Mmmmmm. Wow, so many flavors. It's delicious. I think I've found myself my new favorite spring roll. Haggis spring rolls. Background my playing. So for those of you who aren't familiar with Haggis it's a savory pudding made with sheep's pluck. And that means a sheep's heart, liver and lungs. And if that doesn't sound appetizing enough it's wrapped in the sheep's stomach and it also includes spices and some oats and onions. So that's what we're going to be trying. Background music playing. It's time to cover this bad boy in some gravy. Oh my, oh my. Look at that. So Haggis is served with neeps and tatties, which is basically turnips and potatoes. First bite. So I've got lots of haggis here. Neeps and tatties. Lots of gravy. The verdict. It's awesome. Yeah. That's not an acquired taste. I love it on the very first bite. Do you like it as much as I do? It's a really nice rich winter dish. And like normally I don't like organs. I've had liver before and it has a very strong flavor but somehow when it's all mixed together and they add spices and the gravy it's perfect. I like it. I like haggis! And it's a cold day today so I'm trying something else very Scottish here. It's a nice warm drink. It's called a Hot Toddy. It's got hot water, whisky, lemon and honey. And that sounds good to me. Take a sip. Oh yeah. It goes down nice. Okay, First sip of the Hot Toddy. I'm not I've ever even tried this whiskey. So let's how it is in a hot drink. Ooooh. It's nice. It really warms you up but it's not a strong and overpowering as I thought it would be. This is nice. And it's also very aromatic because they've put some cloves along with the lemon. Like Christmas. So far you're liking Scottish food. Yeah. Background music playing. Background music playing. What's your name? Sam. Sam how you doing man? We're doing a deep-fried snickers, a Twix and we've already done a Mars bar already. Awesome. I'm going to unwrap it. Stick it in the batter. I can't tell you that because it's my secret. Hahaha...secret recipe? Of course. The Twix. One. Two. Mix it around. Give it a little shake. And there it goes. Ah, that looks good. Now for the Twix. Here is the Twix. There you go. How long do you put them in there? Emmmm, we just keep it about...2 or 3 minutes. We fry them separately. This is just for the Mars bars. Mars bars only. Awesome. So the temperature. This is 170 degrees. And while the batter cooks the chocolate will melt. So the batter will cook before the chocolate. Ahhh, perfect. That's so cool. So we've been hearing lots about the Mars bars but Sam here went overboard and tried three different chocolate bars that have been deep fried. So what do you have? Well, at the recommendation of the guy at the chip shop. He recommended I also try the Snickers and the Twix bar, so we've got it all right here. Let's unwrap that. I don't want to drop it here. Okay. Let's see that thing of beauty. Isn't that gorgeous. Alright, so which is which? So I believe this is the Snickers. We've got the two Twixes here and that is the Mars bar. Alright. And you're feeling a little queasy today, so I'm going to be the one trying them all. Yes, you are. Enjoy! So first up. And you can tell they really feel as though they've been deep-fried and melted. This is flimsy in the hand. Ewww. Yeah, this is a Mars bar. I can tell from what is seeping out. Take a bite. Oh, Wow. That is so much better than just having it on its own. It's all melted inside. It's gooey. And you've got the crispiness from the batter on the outside. Mmmmmm. One more bite. Next up Twix. Next up we have the Twix. This one is a little longer. Oh yeah. Is it still crunchy? Yeah, it's still crunchy on the inside. You can see this. All the chocolate has melted on the outside. It's just so much better than having it normally. And the best for last. Best for last. My favorite of all these bars is the Snickers, so I have high expectations for the deep-fried version here. The battered version. Oh yeah. It just melts. All caramel and chocolate inside and the peanuts. Oh,. Let's see the inside of it? That is amazing. Okay, so you've tried all three. Which was our favorite? Definitely the Snickers. Why? Because I love Snickers bars and this just enhanced it. So, it's not surprising that taking something that is already unhealthy and making it even unhealthier would make it taste better. Arrrrggghhhhh! Hahaha So this morning we are at the Loony Dook and it's a bit of tradition here in Scotland that the day of New Years people jump into the freezing waters of the Firth of Forth and it's all to raise money for charity, so we're going to watch them do that. Are you going to do it? No way! Cheering. More cheering. Hahahaha! Yeeaaaah! Yeeeeeaaaah! So there is a man wrapped up in bubble wrap that nearly floated away. The rescue team picked him up in the water. So that was one of the coolest, craziest and I must say zaniest events I've ever seen. I'm glad that I was behind the lens and didn't go into the water. Everyone looks freezing cold right now. Music playing. So this afternoon we are going to be doing a little bit of a taste test. So we've raided a Scottish supermarket and picked out some items that we thought looked very local. So we're going to try those and see what they're like. Yeah, overall we've got five different things. Two beverages and three things to eat. So first up I'm going to be trying something called Irn Bru and apparently after Whisky this is Scotland's second national drink and it looks like a regular fizzy drink. It kind of looks like it could be orange flavored but I hear it's just sweet and doesn't really taste like fruit. Oh, I'm going to need help opening this. Hahahaha Rawwwr. Thank you kindly. So it smells very sweet and sugary. It doesn't smell like orange. Hahaha. It's a bit like cream soda maybe. It's just really really sweet. Like sweeter than Pepsi or 7Up. Oh yeah? Yeah, it reminds me a lot of cream soda as well. Which isn't my favorite beverage, so overall I don't think I'm going to be an Irn Bru man anytime soon. Next up we've got Mackie's of Scotland's Haggis and cracked black pepper flavored chips or crisps as they like to call them here. Right, exactly. Chips here would be referring to like french fries, so we're going to call these crisps. Let's open it up here. It's going to be like Kettle style chips. Crisps, I mean. Kettle style crisps. Let's try this. You can tell that has a smokey flavor. Can you taste the Haggis? Ummmm, yeah, kind of but I mean it has more of a an all dressed smokey flavor in my opinion. I do like them. Why won't you be trying any of those delectable crisps? Well, I got really sick shortly after eating Haggis, so just the name, just the sound of Haggis kind of makes my stomach turn a little bit, so I'm staying away from haggis flavored chips this time around, which is good for me because I get to eat them all. I like them. Good. And what do we have here? Next up we have Crabbie's. Here in the back it says that it is best served chilled with ice and lemon but we have neither of those. Room temperature? And actually we don't even know if this is Scottish or not but I think so. Let's assume. It says following in the pioneering footsteps of the first Scots. Well, there we go. And what is it? I think it's a Ginger beer isn't it? Ginger beer, okay. With alcohol. Hmmmmm, what does that mean? Ginger beer. Hahahaha. That's exactly what is is. It tastes very gingery? Yes, I don't love beer, so I'm not going to say I love it but it's a nice smell. It smells like ginger tea. Tell me how you like it? Oh yeah, I like that a lot. It's got a very. It's quite sweet. I mean normally beer doesn't have this sweet of a taste, so this is a nice refreshing beverage. Refreshing at room temperature. True. And we've got Butterscotch chocolate. Let's give it a go. Hahaha, that's upside down but that's okay. Let's try a piece of this. Mmmmmm. Oh wow! Oh yeah, you really taste the butterscotch. It's creamy and sweet and delicious. Is this milk chocolate or is it dark bitter chocolate? No, it's really sweet. You'll love it. It kind of reminds me of Dulce de Leche. Dulce de Leche chocolate huh? Like it then? Yeah. I do like it. I mean normally organic chocolate isn't that great in my opinion because it's a little bitter. A bit too natural for me. But this is quite nice. She takes another bite. Nice and sweet. It's creamy. Shortbread cookies. This is Christmas in a tin. Mmmm, smells like Christmas? Oooooh, those look good. I can tell I'm going to like this. Nice big thick cookies. Crispy? Not crispy. Just crunchy Christmas cookies, you know? Mmmmmm. Going to share those? Maybe. You know this would make a really souvenir people. If you're visiting Scotland get Scottish shortbread. Those are real good. It reminds me of my Mom's shortbread cookies. She used to make for me for Christmas and I would eat a lot of those. And last but not least we have tablet, which is a sweet treat that everyone has been talking about. And this is what I'm most looking forward to having. This is supposed to be very much like fudge and so I can't wait to try it. This one is whisky flavored. Mmmmm....mmmm. Oh yeah! So I'm just going to go at this like it's a chocolate bar. Just bite right in. Smells good. Oh, wow. That is really really really sweet. Is it soft, crunchy, gooey, chewy? It's a little. I wouldn't call it crunch. It kind of crumbles in your mouth and yeah I can taste a hint of the whisky. I mean it's not overpowering. It's more sweet than anything else but there is definitely a hint of whisky. It smells like cheese. Take a bite. That's the smallest nibble ever. Okay, it's sweet when you taste it but it smells like cheese. I'm not kidding. Is that the whisky smell? Could be yeah. Do you like the taste though? Yes. Even though I'm just nibbling at it. I'm like grazing it with my teeth. It does taste nice. Very sweet. The smell? Mmmmm-ooooh. The smell doesn't do it for you? It gets a nay from me. Okay, so favorites. What was the best thing you ate? I really liked the tablet and the ginger beer the most. Why? Well, I just love to eat fudge and I like to drink beer - especially anything with ginger in it. Gingery beers....mmmmm. Okay, so my favorite I would say was the shortbread cookies. Those were really nice. It reminds me of Christmas and least favorite I'd have to say the tablet just because it smelled really bad. I'm sure regular tablet is great but the Whisky flavored one I'm telling you it smells like cheese. Like go buy a pack and sniff that and come back to me. And I think the thing we both didn't like was the Irn Bru. Yeah, it's a bit too sweet but not terrible. I didn't like it at all. That was my least favorite by far. Anyways, so yeah when you come to Scotland try out these products and try out other things and let us know what you think. And if you have any suggestions of things that we should try while we're here in Edinburgh just leave it in the comments below. I think tomorrow we're going to be hunting for some deep-fried pizza. Number one goal. Yeah, we just had the deep-fried chocolate bars today so. Okay, tootles. Bye.",False,"20150501 - Visit EDINBURGH City Guide ∩╜£ What to SEE, DO & EAT in Edinburgh, Scotland.en.srt"

As cat lovers, we simply adored visiting cat cafes with an opportunity to play, pet and interact with them. When we found out Bangkok had a cat cafe we simply had to go. For those unaware, a cat cafe is a type of themed cafe where cats are the main attraction. When visiting you pay a cover fee (usually in the form of a dessert or a beverage) for the opportunity to watch and pet the cats. Cat cafes are most famous in Japan; however, many may be surprised to know that the first cat cafe was opened in Taipei, Taiwan back in 1998. One of the reasons cat cafes have become so popular in recent years has to do with laws forbidding pets in certain apartment buildings and the fact that a demanding urban lifestyle doesn't cater towards owning a pet. We noticed immediately that there are a number of rules in place to help protect the welfare of the kitties. Before entering a cat cafe you must wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, and put on slippers to ensure the environment is as clean as possible. You can pet the cats but holding them or disturbing them while they are sleeping is not acceptable. Generally speaking taking photos is fine; however, using your flash is forbidden. The cat cafe we visited in Bangkok, Purr Cat Cafe is located on Soi Sukhumvit 53 just off of Sukhumvit Road. It's the purrrrfect escape from the hustle and bustle of the city offering a place to relax with cats. The drinks and desserts available for purchase are more expensive than those at a regular cafe. For cat lovers, this is a small price to pay when you consider the comfort and joy that spending time with cats offers. We can't help but notice all of the ear to ear grins of satisfied customers. We've certainly always felt happy after spending time in a cat cafe. If you haven't had a chance to visit one we highly recommend it. We know for certain this won't be our last time visiting one as we continue gallivanting around the world. Today we're going to visit one of our favorite places, the cat cafe. MEOW! This one is in Hongdae. Yes it is. It's a great place too. Cats making noises. Well someone is sure popular. I am. What are you feeding them? I'm giving them some chicken breast. Owe! Feed me now! It's got sharp teeth. Owe They're like hurry up, I'll take it from you. So today we're at one of our favorite places in Seoul, it's called the Cat Cafe. It's located in Hongdae which is a popular university area. And what the deal is about this place is you come here, you pay for your drinks and then you get the opportunity to roam around and pet with a whole bunch of different cats. As you can see there is one sleeping right against my jacket. Oh, that's cute. Cute kitty! And this little one was sleeping a second ago. Prrrr! And here is a cute little kitty in a box. It's wearing a little taekwondo outfit. Music playing He who has the chicken bits is the popular one. This is Sam in his element playing with all of the cats. So popular! Hello beautiful. One of the reasons I really like this place is because of the cat to person ratio. There is a lot of cats and just a few people. I like this place because it is really easy to find cats affection. Even if you just go to the counter and get some chicken or beef jerky. And in an instant voila best friend. You're surrounded by like 10 cats, so it's great. And here is a wall of the different kitties you can meet. They all have names and background information. Your face is hilarious! I'm feeding a lion here! And there is some kitties hanging out up top here. Hello! We're going to go try to feed the kitty that is up top. Let's see if it wakes him up. There we go. Hungry fella! Kicking and rolling sound of the ball. This one is pre-occupied with my bag. What are you looking for? This one looks like my cat Tommy back home. Let's get a close up. Tommy? Hey Tommy! This one has been here the whole time and now it is curled up and sleeping. Today we're back at the cat cafe and as you can see. Oh no! Hahahahaha! There is a fight. Oh my gosh! And what are we doing at the cat cafe? Feeding them when they are not fighting. Hahahaha! That's awesome. Meow. Behave! Behave little kitties. That's so mean. The other one was nice. I'm going to go feed him. We were just given some cat food on our hands and now my job is to get this off. How does my hair look? Marvelous! Cat cafes seem like a novelty to most but certainly not for us. Visiting Purrfect Cat Cafe in Georgetown - Penang, Malaysia - marked our third cat cafe outing in Asia. Previously we had visited one in Seoul, South Korea and another one in Bangkok, Thailand. The format for this recently opened cat cafe is similar to the two others we visited. For the opportunity to spend time with cats you have to purchase 18 Ringgit (the equivalent of six dollars) worth of snacks, desserts and/or drinks. You can freely pet and play with the cats but picking them up or entering their sleep zone is not permitted. This particular cat cafe had its strong and weak points. A smaller and more intimate space was certainly a bonus; however, there were less cats to play with and many of them were sleeping in the no people zone. Overall, we'd recommend the Purrfect Cat Cafe as a fun afternoon outing to escape the stifling heat and humidity of typical day in George Town. Shhhhhhhh Today we are at a cat cafe in Seoul. We've come here to play with all of the kittens. Ooooh! Hahahahaha It's the alien cat baby! Meow Meow! Jumping sounds. It's having a bit of chicken. Where did you get the chicken from? One of the girls gave it to me. It was nice of her. You hungry? Meow meow! There are some cute ones over here. Well, now he is cleaning himself. That's not so cute. Background noise. Today we're at a special cafe called the Cat Cafe in Hongdae, Seoul. It's called Koyangi cafe. Koyangi is cat in Korean. And we're having a great time just hanging out playing with cats. When you come into the cat cafe it only costs 8000 Won and what you do is pay that fee get a drink. Choose almost any kind of different drink you want. So this is one of our drinks here and you get to hang out and play with the cats as long as you want. Wait cats, wait. What do you got? No. Look who is popular. What do you got on your hand? Let's see. Show us. Just a little bit of cat food. Mmmmm...delicious. Look at everyone around. Meow meow. There is an alien on my table. Haaahhahaha. Alien puddy. Oooh! What is it doing? It's taking a little nap in the box. Hahahaha It's a hungry one. Meow Meow. Hahahaha It's like whatever. You have no food for me. We've visited cat cafes in three different countries - one in Korea, one in Thailand and one in Malaysia. This is going to be our first in Germany. This one is called Pee Pees Katzencafé. As soon as we walked into Pee Pee's Katzencafe, two very energetic young cats greeted us. As friendly as could be they came over to sniff our bags, clothes and shoes before turning their attention to what was going on outside of the window. Although it was just the two of them, they certainly gave us enough attention while providing plenty of entertainment as we sipped on tea and ate cake. It wasn't soon before they started to play with one another tearing around the room and leaping from pole to pole. Soon play turned to fighting. They really went at it for a while - blue versus red. For anyone who has had a young cat as a pet this is certainly normal behavior and it made us laugh. Not long after they started to settle down a bit for an afternoon nap. This cafe was quite different from the ones we have visited in Asia. For starters it was quite small and they only had two cats to play with us. Also they didn't have a lot of toys which makes it a little difficult to be interactive with the cats because it is difficult to lure them your way. Overall it was a nice little place to drink some tea and have cake with some cats for company. The total cost of the cat cafe was 8 Euros that allowed us to get two teas and a slice of cake, which was quite affordable we thought.",False,"20150415 - Best Cat Cafes Around The World (Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Germany).en.srt"

Vegas, Baby! With a weekend to explore Las Vegas we arrived hitting the ground running wanting to pack in as much as we possibly could over a short period of time. Nigh life, music, gambling, entertainment, dancing, walking the Strip and shows in the evening. Driving luxury cars, helicopter tours, exploring the Grand Canyon and marveling at Red Rock Canyon by day. Las Vegas was full of surprises. The following is a Las Vegas travel guide to experience the most out of your vacation to Sin City. It is the best things to do on Las Vegas Strip along with day excursions outside of the city limits. As they say, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. So we aren't in Canada no more! This weekend we actually escaped to Las Vegas so we are going to be spending three days just enjoying winter in the desert and doing cool stuff. And today we're walking down the strip and we're going to show you some of the sights. And the best part - no winter parka right now. Enough walking for a while. I'm starving. Let's get some dinner. We're going to Shake Shack. So when this buzzer goes it's time for me to get my food. It's ready. It's ready. Go get it! There is the man bringing food. Ooh la lah. I'm on a total health kick today. We've got a double burger, cheese fries, peanut butter shake and a root beer float. When in Vegas. I think I found my new favorite burger here at the Shake Shack. They just do their patties to perfection over here. Tell, me. Tell, me! You know what? Nobody does fast food like Americans. They've got it down to a science. It's absolutely unhealthy but so delicious. Argh. We just found a jelly bean Statue of Liberty and I'm going to dare Sam five bucks to lick it. Do it, do it. It's filthy. Don't! This is like Charlie in the Chocolate Factory. This is a very volatile situation. I'm walking into a Hershey's candy store. Ooh la lah. I hope they have free samples. I think I'm about to create my own chocolate bar. Ooh. Let's go white chocolate. I don't know how this works actually. Oh, smile big! Ow! Retake. Retake. Looks good! What did you find there? Two and a half pounds of peanut butter and chocolate. And these are only two cups if you can imagine. One here, one there. So what did you find? I found the largest Hershey chocolate bar in the world. Really? We're going to head back to the hotel and get ready for a show. We're going to be seeing the Michael Jackson Show at the Mandalay Bay but unfortunately we can't bring any cameras in there so we won' t be able to show you that but maybe after the show we'll hit the town again and show you the sights. Not maybe! Definitely! One of the highlights of our three day weekend in Las Vegas was the opportunity to take a helicopter tour over the Grand Canyon. Visiting this natural marvel is already a once in a lifetime experience but getting to see it from above the cherry on top. Every single person on that helicopter smiled the whole way there and back. Here are some of the views from that flight. We just took a helicopter tour with Maverick Helicopters and we've just landed in the Grand Canyon. And you guys, it is so impressive. So what did you think of the flight over? Well, it's been quite a while since I've been in a helicopter. The last time I rode in one was when I was a child. And I just love them so much more than taking a plane. It is just a smoother experience and the helicopter is really versatile. It can zig and zag and go all over the place. Perfect for filming and perfect for views. Were you a little scared considering it was your first ride? My hands were a little clammy from the experience but honestly it is amazing. Like, once you are up in the air and you get to see the landscape below you it is just so amazing. So I'm not scared anymore. The scenery is so distracting you kind of forget that you're nervous. Yeah, and it just becomes a really peaceful experience being up in the air. So it was really cool. So we're fueling up, swapping seats and now it is time to head back to Las Vegas. On the flight back we flew over the Vegas Strip for a bird's eye view of the city. When the helicopter finally touched down we still had giant grins plastered on our faces. This is an experience that will be very hard to top. On our second day in Las Vegas we decided to escape the city and enjoy a bit of the natural scenery. We joined the Pink Jeep Tour for an afternoon exploring Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. Located about a half hour drive outside of the city this is an easy day trip filled with rugged desert landscapes. We spent a few hours driving through the park and also doing a bit of hiking along the way. Here are some of the highlights. Alright, it's time to climb this bad boy. Okay, show us your climbing skills. Scramble up that mountain. Just like an old man. So this over here is the Calico Ridge and the landscape reminds me a lot of Northern Argentina. The toilet. Is the toilet occupied? Hmm. Huh? Hello, there. So we are coming to the end of this outing. We're just doing our last little hike through the park and soon we'll be back in Las Vegas. But how did you enjoy it? It's been awesome. It is so nice. I didn't realize that there was so many scenic areas just outside of Las Vegas. And the best part is that I am building up an appetite for an enormous steak. Or sushi? No, steak. Check out my sweet ride! Test driving a Lamborghini, Ferrari & Porsche in Las Vegas Travel Script: Alright, so this morning we are at Wold Class Driving here in Las Vegas and we are going to be test driving some luxury cars. Feeling the need for speed? Oh, yes! Well, hello hello there. I'm starting out in the Porsche. Ooh La Lah. How are making out so far? Fantastic. I'm a natural guys. I think for my next birthday Sam should buy me a luxury car. Let's win the lottery. Right now we are arriving at Lake Mead National Park. So it is time to switch over to car number two. We've just stopped here at the National Park. We're going to get some shots of the scenery and keep driving. Let's get your cars into gear. Everybody ready? Follow me starting with the Lamborghini first. Lamborghini time, are you ready? I sure am. And last but certainly not least we've got the... I'm driving a Ferrari baby. That was a pretty awesome experience. I ended up driving three different luxury cars. There was the Porsche, the Lamborghini, and the Ferrari and we got to feel the speed in those babies. So out of the three cars which was your favorite? I think I might choose the Porsche just because it was very smooth and easy car to drive. The other ones were a bit harder manlier. So you like that more than the muscle cars? Yeah, but it was a lot of fun. Highly recommended. It is so sad to be leaving but it is our last night in Las Vegas so we're going to go out and try and see as much as we can this evening. Let's go wild. Let's gamble. Why are you at the ATM machine right now? We need some cash to fuel our gambling addiction. It is never ending. The lights. The noise. The ding ding ding ding. This is what a casino sounds like twenty-four seven. We see people gambling here at like five in the morning when we get up for breakfast. And yes we do get up that early. What would a trip to Vegas be like without a little gambling? Sam, even looks like an old gambler today with that hat. Oh, I do. Guess what? We're such cheapskates we're playing with pennies. We're going to the penny machine. They don't even have pennies in Canada anymore, so let's use these American pennies up. Shiver me timbers. I'm playing a pirate game. I'm going to win me some money. Tell us? Alright, I was a pretty lousy pirate, so I'm going to try my luck with this Owl game. Hoot! Hoot! Ding ding ding ding ding. Being the supreme cheapskate that I am I'm cutting my loses after two dollars. So we're here at the Bellagio for the water show. And they have a lot of frequent shows in the evening so we're just waiting for it to start. So we are now at the Cosmopolitan and we are visiting one of the coolest bars in all of Las Vegas. This behind me is the Chandelier.",False,20150326 - Things to do in LAS VEGAS Travel Guide.en.srt

Having the chance to participate in the Winter Carnival festivities was an opportunity of a lifetime. What did we do? Well, it's more like what didn't we do. Ice canoeing, dog sledding, sleigh riding and tobogganing to mention just a few. When we weren't exploring the Old Quarters of Quebec City we were off doing things like checking out the magnificent Ice Hotel or visiting with Bonhomme. Overall, it was a celebration of winter that we'll never forget. The following is a complete travel guide to experiencing Quebec City Carnaval. Welcome to Quebec City! We are here in the winter capital of the world. And it is carnival which means everyone is out embracing the cold and embracing the winter fun. Alright, so what are we doing next? We're going to be doing something I've wanted to do for years. We're going to dog sledding! Woo! Go, puppies go! Steer it. Go, puppies! Good puppies. Come on, puppies. We're going ice fishing. We're going to be catching our lunch today. Ready to fish? I'm ready. I've got my bait. I've got my fishing rod. Let's do this. They ate your bait. They ate it and didn't come up. Let's go get some more. That is not very good fishing. I know. That's really bad fishing. Okay, round two. Let's get ourselves a fish. Oh, we have a fish and I feel kind of bad. We got one. I know I eat fish but I feel a little guilty right now. Now it is time to cook it. Lunch, right here. Just warming up. Here is our catch of the day. This is the big reveal. You can see the steam coming off. That smells really nice. I know, I think they've put seasonings on it. Oh, yeah. That looks good. Have it. Oh, I can't see. The smoke is going in my eyes. Alright, first bite. Mmmm. How is it? That's amazing. Can you look at the camera? They put some onions and spices inside and a little bit of butter. It's really good. I think it is time for a romantic sleigh ride for two. So right now we're getting ready to go inside Bonhomme's ice palace. Let's go visit him. I even once went to Mexico. It's a little bit warm. When I got there I was about eight feet as I am usually and when I came back I was five foot four. I melted a little bit. Is that a video? Let's do something memorable. Audrey. And you're from? Kingston, right? Okay. Hello, my friends from Kingston. We're with Audrey right now. We invite you to come to the biggest winter carnival in the world in Quebec City. I love you all and wish you a Joyeux Carnaval. I love you all and wish you a Joyeux Carnaval. Merci. Bye, bye. Bye, Bohomme. Merci. I don't know about you but I'm getting hungry. It's time for a Beavertail. It looks like a few other people have the same idea. They have a Reese's pieces beavertail. I think that is the one I'm getting. Oh my, what do we have here? Reese's pieces Beavertail with chocolate and peanut butter and a hot chocolate because I really need to warm up. Show me that Reese's Pieces Beavertail. Oh, my gosh that looks amazing. I wish I could capture the smell on video. Alright, let's take a big bite of that. And? That's hitting the spot right now. That's really good. No. Yeah. Go Max. Way to go Max. Go Max. Sam wanted a horn to toot. Alright, unfortunately all things come to an end. We've had an absolutely marvelous day out here at the carnaval. It's been so memorable. Now it's time to go home and warm up. Faster, horses! Faster! And how is the ice princess this morning? Doing very well. This morning we are heading in to the Old City. We're going to do a bit of a walking tour on our own. Let's head into town and check it out. We are about to enter the old city. There are real benefits to waking up early on a Sunday morning. We've practically got the old part of the city to ourselves. And what a different feel. In the summer it had a totally different vibe and now in the winter it's like an entirely new city to explore. So I just noticed there are railings all along the street and I think it is because it is so steep and it gets so icy in the wintertime that if they didn't have these babies people would just be sliding all the way down. Well, we've been sliding a lot anyways. Yes. So it is kind of cool being here in the winter because even though it is February it still feels like Christmas never left. Like we still have Christmas trees, Christmas lights, lots of red. So it feels very festive. Absolutely. We found a little place where to warm up. There is a little outdoor fireplace. It is our own personal fire place. And we really need it after all that walking. Put your legs up by the fire. It's a dragon! It's a snow dragon! A fire breathing dragon. Alright, it is time to warm up. Let's go for a hot chocolate and maybe even a cupcake. Yum yum. Lead the way. How is that hot chocolate? Mmmm. That is so good after that really really cold walk. Alright, it's time to lick your lips. You've got cream all over your face. There you go. That's some kind of classic Canadian food. Here we've got Nanaimo bars. Audrey is digging in. Very Canadian. Let's have that first bite. Mmmm. Sweet enough for you? It's such a nice breakfast. And I've got fudge and Bonhomme de Carnaval. And this guy has been really nice to me but unfortunately I'm going to have to take a bite out of his head. Sorry, Bonhomme. Does he taste good? He does. What do you have over there? And the last indulgence of the day - we've got pure maple sugar fudge. I'm not surprised you would go for that. You're always looking for fudge wherever we go. I don't have anything to say - it's just pure bliss. Now if you can believe it we were bonkers enough to be doing ice canoeing out in the Saint Lawrence with those massive chunks of ice. It was just one of the craziest things we've ever done. We can't wait to show you that video as well. So now we're working our way up to the Chateau Frontenac. That means climbing a lot of steps. I'm already out of breath. We still have a few more to go. Lead the way. It's a little steep and slippery over here. I almost feel like I could go snowboarding. Do it. Do it. And the concludes our walking tour of Old Quebec. Now we're going to head back to our hotel, warm up a little bit and get ready to do some more exploring in the afternoon. We are in a winter wonderland today also known as the Ice Hotel here in Quebec City. Let me take you in. Have a seat while you wait to be checked in. The vortex of time! Welcome to the Spa. This is where you come to warm up right before going to bed. Or when you need to pee. It looks like a sauna in there. Woah. We're going to ride the grand slide. If you don't fall down first. We're going to enter the bar and drink in glasses made of ice. What do you got in your hands? Vodka cranberry. Mmmmm. And my lips didn't get stuck because they prepared the ice a very special way. I couldn't tell you how but it is a special way. Cheers! Salut! Welcome to the Medieval chamber. I slept here two weeks ago. What happened? I survived. I'm alive. Hey, you're here. And well! So basically like I told my husband I looked like a beached whale. Okay. Because you're in your sleeping bag except first of all you go in the saunas, you go in the spas to warm up and then afterwards you go inside and there is a whole section towards the indoor pavilion reserved completely only for our roomed night guests. Where they have locker rooms, lockers for their stuff, etc. So once you're done with the spa and the sauna you go inside and you dry off and then you put on what you're going to need to sleep. And it is basically a little spandex thing or it has to be artificial like fleece. It has to be artificial, not artificial but synthetic fibers. Nothing cotton. So no white socks. Like I'm wearing right now. Basically, you then come into your room. Access is from nine PM to nine AM. We don't give out rooms. We don't do early check ins or late checkouts. Okay, because we have visitors. All of our clients have to mingle well throughout. So basically we arrive in your room and there are two candles or a fire place going and it is to take the humidity out. The fireplace obviously there is no heat. We would have a meltdown. Okay. The sleeping bags are in huge pouches and they're thermal sleeping bags. You are basically looking like a Mummy. Okay. Then you get on the bed. This is the fun part. You get on the bed, you get in to your liner of your sleeping bag and then you get in the sleeping bag and then they tell you you have to change your pair of socks. You're like really? I'm like mummified in this thing and you're standing and you're like this. So basically I went down, I then put on a change of socks while you're in the sleeping bag, there is absolutely no humidity and then you mummify yourself. You're all zipped up. This was me. This was my husband. Okay. It's true. My husband, I could only see his nose. I'm like man you snore. Zip that thing back up. It didn't work. If you're all quiet there is no sound. It is phenomenal to sleep here. You go to bed around midnight and then we wake up people at eight in the morning because you're sleeping that much. Now you're going to say Majole, what about the three AM pee pee? Well, it does happen. We all have to go sometimes. And now you're entering into my private bubble. But at five thirty in the morning I've got to go pee. Whether I'm in Vancouver, whether I'm in Quebec City five thirty my alarm clock goes. So my husband and I we said whoever wakes up at night, whoever needs to go pee wakes the other up saying honey do you want to come with me to the bathroom? So when I woke my husband up at five thirty he's like I don't think so you're going alone. The only iffy part is the three seconds you put your boots back on. That's the only thing that was cold because you're leaving it outside. You don't put anything on any ice. I didn't put my glasses on the ice because it would go in. Literally. Okay, you put everything in your boots or in the pouch. So basically in your sleeping bag pouch. Your coat, you open it up, you put it on your bed and then you're sleeping on top. So it gets your body heat. Inside your thermal sleeping bag it goes up to twenty four degrees. At one point you're in the night unzipped everything and I needed to breathe. I really, it's a good thing that there are showers here in the morning. That could also be a sign of hypothermia you know? No, but it was really everybody you're really hot. The minute you unzip you see the vapor coming out. Okay. It is a sleep that you cannot have anywhere else. The oxygen that you're breathing in is phenomenal. And we couldn't leave without checking out the maple sugar shack. You lead the way. Well, I didn't come away empty handed. Check out this. I've got two different maple syrup products. All dressed and ready to go? Oh, yeah. Taping them on. So you look a little bit ridiculous. I feel like a robot. And you look like a robot. But these are actually our outfits to go ice canoeing, so we've got special socks, special boots and hockey pads. I'm so excited to try ice canoeing. This is as Canadian as it gets. These are large, medium, small. My shoes. Can you stand up? For a second. Put your feet like this. Like that on the toe. Yeah. So we have a super exciting morning today. We are out here in Quebec City and we are going to be going ice canoeing. All geared up. Practicing in the snow but we're going to be hitting the ice soon. So we officially survived ice canoeing on the Saint Lawrence River. If you can have a look behind me you'll be able to see what exactly we were trying to canoe in. I mean it is a combination of ice, a bit of water, chucks of icebergs. It's crazy! Alright, the big moment we've been waiting for - the Carnival parade. Everyone is out and we're all bundled up. Let's get this party started. Chicken noodle soup. Trying to stay warm. Is that chicken soup? It's time to toot my horn. Good job. Alright, so what are we doing next? We're going to be doing something I've wanted to do for years. We're going dog sledding! Woo! That's awesome. Go, puppies, go! Pull. Steer it. Go, puppies! Good puppies. Oh uh. Oh, shoot. Hey pups. Come on. They passed us. Come on puppies. Let's go puppies. I'm too fat. I'm too fat. I'm too fat, they can't pull us up the hill. Come on. Come on, puppies. There we go. Come on puppies. Stop, stop. One of the most exciting events of Quebec's Winter Carnival was the ice canoe race. This event is exactly what it sounds like. Teams hit the frigid waters of the Saint Lawrence river with their canoes and race through a mix of ice, slush and water. Originally, a means of winter transport, ice canoeing has become a sport for the bold and brave. Having had the chance to try this ourselves we had some serious respect for the teams competing. Here is a look at this legendary event. So right now we're getting ready to go inside Bonhomme's ice palace. Let's go visit him. People ask me what I do after Carnival. I travel the world and I invite people to come to this great festivity. My carnival. I even once went to Mexico. It's a little bit warm. When I got there I was about eight feet as I am usually and when I came back I was five foot four. I melted a little bit. So when did you arrive in Quebec? Two days ago. Hello. You're not too jealous? No. Okay. Hahaha. Cheese. Is that a video? Yeah, let's do something memorable. Audrey. And you're from? Kingston, right? Yes. Okay. Hello my friends from Kingston, we're with Audrey right now and we invite you to come to the biggest winter carnival in the world in Quebec City. I love you all and wish you a Joyeux Carnaval. Woo! So my friends, you've seen my kick right? Get your cameras ready. I'm going to kick it for you. So this is where I train. I hold onto to this and I do my kick. I've practiced that so many times that I don't have to hold this anymore. You want the kick? Yeah. You guys want the kick? Oh, yeah! Say it again. Yeah! Get your cameras ready. I know I'll have to do it a couple of times because you won't be ready enough. You ready. One, two, three. Woo! Did you guys get it? Joyeux Carnaval! Go ahead. This is my museum. This is some of my museum. Some of my artifacts over the years. This is my restroom. Can we say that? Restroom? No. No, not really eh? This is where I rest. So I can stand right here but not for too long because I'm going to melt. Alright. Bonhomme? Bonhomme? There is a question here. Yes. Somebody, where are you from? Toronto. You see where their priorities are. She's wondering, well actually ask him. Where do you go pee? Hahaha. Hey, are you recording this? Okay, I'll have to have a political answer then. I don't. I don't have time to do this. I just keep it for myself because I'm being made of snow and ice and it helps to keep it in. There you go. That's a great answer. I wish you a great day at my carnival. I love you all and wish you a Joyeux Carnaval! Merci, bye Bonhomme. Bye-bye. Bye, Bonhomme. Merci.",False,20150315 - Quebec City Winter Carnival Travel Guide (Carnaval de Que╠übec).en.srt

We got up super early at five in the morning and check it out this is where we are - Angkor Wat, Cambodia! We are inside Angkor Wat and this is the largest religious structure in the whole world. This is my very first time visiting Angkor Wat but Sam over here has been to this place a whopping four times. World traveler much? How is your forth time here different from you the first, second and third? Tell us! Well the temples are certainly still as impressive as ever but there are so many more tourists here than when I first came. I would say it has tripled or quadrupled or maybe even more than that. It is just unbelievable how people are sharing the experience. This is actually a Hindu temple that was dedicated to the Hindu God Vishnu and the temple was built by a Cambodian King who helped unify the country and to also spread the Khmer influence across Southeast Asia. One of the most impressive things about this temple here is actually the massive moat that surrounds it. It is one of the first things you notice as you're coming up to the temple. There are several options for booking tickets to visit the temples of Angkor. We went with the three day option and that was $40 USD dollars but you can also go with the one day option, two day option or if you really love temples the seven days. I would image that is quite pricey. A good time to come to Angkor Wat is actually right at lunchtime because a lot of the tours, buses and tourists are out having lunch or at that point in the day temple-d out, which means they are really hot, tired and sort of seen enough temples for the day. If you want and alternative time to come definitely consider coming around between 12 and 1:30. Coming back for the forth time was amazing. I never get tired of this place but one funny observation I have is that I noticed that any family's dragging along their children really didn't seem to be enjoy this as much. They were just dragging their feet. I think it has a lot to do with the heat and humidity outside right now. It is really really hard to be walking around and not sweating profusely. I really enjoyed getting up early and coming to watch the sunrise at Angkor Wat. I thought that maybe the experience wouldn't feel special because there are literally hundreds of people also here at that time of day but it felt like we were sharing the moment together, so I really enjoyed it. Welcome to Bali, Indonesia! After spending nearly a year travelling in Southeast Asia, we couldn't leave without first visiting Bali. We decided to take a 2 week trip to the famed island and split our time between Ubud and Sanur to explore as much as possible. During one of our first nights on the island, we attended a Balinese fire and trance performance. This dance and music drama originated in the 1930s, depicting stories from Hindu literature. Ubud is the art and cultural capital of Bali and we enjoyed spending a few days here. Our mornings in the town were spent visiting the various temples, browsing through markets, and soaking in the surroundings. We also had a chance to visit the Tegalalang Rice Terraces. They were lush, green, and reminded us of our time in Korea because Sam's apartment overlooked rice terraces. Bali is mainly Hindu and the island is home to many temples. During our time in Bali we visited the Elephant Temple, which is best known for its menacing cave entrance. We also visited Gunung Kawi, which is nicknamed the Rock Temple. The rock temple gets its name because of the 10 shrines that were carved into the rock wall and stand 7 meters tall. They are truly a sight to behold. Well, I am supposed to sprinkle water on my head, so here we go. During our tour around the island, we stopped at a lookout point where we saw the impressive Mount Batur looming in the horizon. Mount Batur is an active volcano, however, when we learned that it was open to hikers, we decided we were up for the challenge. Bali is a great jump off point for exploring some of the surrounding beaches and islands. Trips to Lombok, Nusa Lembongan, and the Gili Islands are very easy to arrange. There are plenty of water sports to choose from including snorkeling, free diving, scuba diving, surfing and even kayaking. Ubud is home to the monkey forest where infamous little macaques roam freely. The monkey forest is home to over 600 monkeys, who over time have lost all fear of man. The monkeys are not shy and will approach people and even climb onto their bodies if they believe you have food. If you're feeling adventurous and would like to feed the monkeys, you can purchase bananas right at the entrance of the monkey forest. One of the highlights of our time in Bali, was climbing Mount Batur for sunrise. The morning of the hike, we got up at 2 in the morning and were driven to the base of the volcano. Armed with a trusty guide and flashlights in hand, we began the steep climb that would take close to 2 hours to complete. We took plenty of breaks along the way, but once we finally reached the top, we were rewarded with a rainbow colored sunrise. Overall, we really enjoyed our time in Bali! It may not have been the quiet paradise that's depicted in the movies, but it offered culture, natural beauty, and it was a great place to relax. Today we're taking a fun little day trip outside of Chiang Mai. We are visiting the Elephant Nature Park, which is about sixty kilometers outside of the city. This is an elephant rescue and rehabilitation center, so we're going to be showing you around. This center is also a refuge for a number of injured and abandoned animals such as dogs, cats, water buffalo and others. We have a bucket full of fresh fruit and on today's menu for the elephants are bananas and watermelons. Hi Baby! There you go. No bananas. Nope! That was my first time touching an elephant and there skin is surprisingly course and hairy. Right now the rescue center is home to thirty seven elephants. Thirty two of them are female and five of them are male. These are Asian elephants, which vary from the African elephant. The African elephant is actually a lot larger than the Asian elephant and they also have much bigger ears. Most of the elephants on the site have been rescued from logging, tourism and begging industries. This is the happiest time of day! The elephants are now being bathed. Overall, the experience at the Elephant Nature Park has been phenomenal. We've really enjoyed having an opportunity to feed, bathe and interact with all of the elephants. It is a great alternative to doing the trekking where you are just sitting on top of the elephant and they are working. This way you get to spend time with the elephant in its natural environment feeding it and just having a great time. We have made it to Luang Prabang and this city has quickly become one of my favorites here in Southeast Asia. This is the cultural hub of Laos and we're going to show you a few of the things you can do around town. When you're visiting Luang Prabang, it is really easy to stick to the city center. There is so much to do and see there but if you have the time come outside and explore the outskirts of the city. Come and check out the more rural sections. Right now we're going across a bamboo bridge and we're going to see what is on the other side. Lead the way. Because this is a very small city it is really easy to find yourself in the countryside. That's exactly what we've been doing just wandering down rural areas and we even found a dog to join us for the walk. Now we are up bright and early for a biking tour around the city. We picked up these bikes for 20,000 Kip, which is $2.50 USD and we have them for the day, so we're going to be cycling around. Let's see what we find. When comparing Luang Prabang to other cities in Southeast Asia there are some major advantages. One of them being that there is hardly any traffic here. It's a wonderful opportunity to take out your bicycle and just explore. You can go down the main roads, you can go down the side streets and you're not going to have to deal with cars and other bicycles or even pedestrians. Luang Prabang is very pedestrian friendly. In fact, there are so many different little back-alleys and lanes to explore that it is just a great idea to wander about without any sense of direction. There are some fantastic views in this city so one of our recommendations is to enjoy a meal by the river, which is what we're doing tonight. Another thing you'll want to do when you're in Luang Prabang is to visit all of the temples around the city. This morning we're visiting Wat Xieng Thong and it is one of the main temples in Luang Prabang. It is also known as the Golden City Temple and it really has some impressive glass mosaics. You'll want to wander around and take some photos. It is 20,000 Kip to enter which is $2.50 USD and like most places it is good to come early because it starts to get busy during the middle of the day. Now it is time for us to get a little bit of exercise. We're going to climb up 328 steps up Mount Phou si which is more like a hill for the best views of Luang Prabang. Admission to reach the top of this mountain is 20,000 Kip which is again is $2.50 USD. It is kind of cool going up because you go up one way and then you come down the other side of the mountain so you get to see different views along the way. How could we have a list of things to do in a city without focusing on the local cuisine. We're here at our favorite restaurant Tamarind. We've been here so often it's literally our home away from home and we're going to show you a few of our favorite dishes. This is the dipping platter. This over here is a coriander pickle. Next we have an eggplant dip. A tomato dip. We have paste made from buffalo skin. We have some seaweed chips and then some vegetables that we can use with the sauce. Let's dig in. That all goes together, of course, with our sticky rice. Sam is going to demonstrate. This is how you eat. You just kind of put together a little ball like that and then you can pick a different dip. I'll try the buffalo sauce here. You put it together just like that and you pop it in your mouth. Delicious! This is the second plate we've ordered. Again, here we have a vegetable pickle. This is a pork salad that also has banana flowers. We have a pork sausage and here is some buffalo jerky - Sam's favorite. Oh yeah! Over here we have some little lettuce rolls that are stuffed with different dips and different sauces. We'll be trying those. We've ordered so much food we almost forgot about this next dish. It is time for me to do the honors. I'm going to unveil our steamed fish, which comes wrapped in banana leaf. It is called Mok Pa. Let's see what is in here. It is like opening a present. I know. It is like Christmas on a plate. Oh, wow! There it is. You can see the steam coming off of it. That is going to be good. And when the sun goes down it is time to go shopping. We're at the tourist night market and we're picking up souvenirs. If there is one thing that Luang Prabang is known for is for its Almsgiving which happens every morning at six AM. This is where monks collect alms of rice from kneeling locals and tourists. Tips on how not to be a total wanker at the ceremony. First, don't use your flash and don't blind the monks. Secondly, don't chase them down. You see people doing both of these things and it is infuriating. If you love to eat like we do then you can't leave Luang Prabang without taking a cooking class. Today we're at the Phou si market and we're picking up ingredients before we start preparing our food. Not much sugar in Lao cooking like in Thai food. When you taste Thai food you taste milky and creamy and sweet things because they add lots of coconut milk and lots of sugar. That is why their food tastes like that. Laos food is different. Lao food tastes lots of herbs and lots of texture. This is Lao food. I'd like to point out that Sam and I are making the exact same dish. This is his sauce and this is mine. What are you missing? Just about everything. Here we have our buffalo salad. We stir friend some buffalo meat and we also added beansprouts and there is banana flowers. We have string beans, hot chilies and mint leaves. We're going to be rolling this up in lettuce leaves. It is kind of like a little fresh roll. Today we are standing in front of Malaysia's most iconic building the Petronas Towers. There are lots of different vantage points around the park so that you can get your shot with the Petronas Towers and this is one of them. The Petronas towers took six years to build and they were the tallest building in Asia until Taipei 101 took them over. I've been to Tapei 101 and these are more impressive. These towers were designed by an Argentinean architect names Caesar Pelli - represent! Represent because why? Oh because I grew up in Argentina. There you go. The double decker sky bridge here connects to the two towers together. It is quite awesome. My question is this a water fountain or can I actually go swimming in there. It is Saturday Night in Chiang Mai and today we are heading to the Saturday Night market. Well, we're still a few blocks away but I know we're close - you know why? - because I can smell the food. What do you got there? I got myself a twist potato, which is a lot like the tornado chips we used to have in Korea. It looks like it is all seasoned. It is nice. It is barbecue flavored. You are going to be sharing that! You are wasting the chips. Yeah, that's blueberry. It looks like blueberry cheesecake with ice cream. It is going to be messy. Snow ice cream with blueberry sauce drizzled over top. How articulate. Mmmmmm. What did you get? I've got some pan-fried dumplings. They are very similar to the Korean gun mandu we often had when we were living as teachers in Korea. Let's see if these are as good. They look hot. They're pretty good. Someone found his favorites here. What started as just a little snack out here at the market has turned out to be a full on feast. I've got dim sum and fried spring rolls. Looking good. I got this - German sausage. It is very good. Krap. In case, we didn't quite have enough to eat - a sweet little dessert treat. That is banana egg roti with lots of chocolate and condensed milk drizzled over top. Welcome to Singapore! We've got less than 48 hours in the city and we're going to show you as much as we possibly can. With limited time ticking down to visit the world's most prosperous city state and busiest port, we set out on foot, bus, subway and boat to cover as much ground as we possibly could. Singapore has often been given the title of a sterile Utopia; however, after traveling around chaotic Southeast Asian hubs like Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Saigon it was a welcome relief to visit a mega city that was clean, orderly, spacious and pedestrian friendly. One of the top highlights was visiting the various districts including Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam. Hopping on a traditional bum boat offered a unique perspective of the city as we were able to learn more about its colorful history on our guided tour. One of the highlights was drinking Singapore Slings at the Raffles Hotel where the drink was invented. Paying 27 Singapore dollars allowed us to sip on this wonderful cocktail and throw peanuts on the floor. Singapore is impressive by day but really shines at night. Many of the standout landmarks have a completely different look when the sun goes down and the bright lights of the city emerge. When it comes to street food Singapore ranks favorably with Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand. Hawker centres offer up a spread of Asian delights that were heavy on flavor while being light on our wallet. In order to cover as much ground as possible we purchased hop on hop off bus tickets to get around the city. Being able to get on and off whenever we wanted was a real bonus as it helped us preserve our walking legs. Although we saw many of the most popular attractions such as Merlion, Marina Bay and the Fullerton Hotel it was the adventures we had wandering around that formed the greatest impressions of the city. Overall, our time in Singapore was distinctly memorable. Hopefully, we'll have a chance to come back again soon to explore more of this impressive 21st century city state. This is the hillside town of Pai. It is about 3.5 hours away from Chiang Mai and this is where we've been spending the weekend. We are staying at the Pai Chan Cottages and this is our private little Bungalow, so let's go have a look inside. Hey! Come on in! This is our humble little room here. You can see we've got a nice big size bed and mosquito net over here. Fortunately this time of the year we haven't had to be using it very often. It's freezing at night! It is freezing so likely the mosquitoes have all died. The best part about this place are the views. Check out this: rice fields! Am I interrupting your nap? You're just too cute and wrinkly. Look at that little nose. Meow meow! We've only got a few days left here in Thailand and I've been hearing from friends raving about Pai for years and I've always put off coming here. This time I said 'There is no way we're going to leave Thailand without coming to Pai."" Now I understand what all of the fuss is about. This place is wonderful. It is one of the most relaxing towns I've ever visited and we're going to show you around. You'll get to see first hand why we love it here. What are you doing? I couldn't be anymore relaxed than in this hammock right now. At this rate, I don't even know if we're get into town. One of the main reasons people come to Pai is to just relax and totally chill out. A lot of other destinations you go to visit temples, you go to do other types of things but here it is just enjoying the scenery, wandering around and swinging on a hammock. Those are the top things to do and I'm loving it so far. We seem to have found hippy central just across the river. There is a cool little bar called sunset bar and it can be reached via a bamboo bridge. Shall we check it out? That was awesome! We crossed that rickety old bridge and then we came to some really cool looking guesthouses and now we're here in the fields. One of the draws to Pai is being able to explore the countryside. Yesterday, I rented my very first scouter. It only cost me three dollars a day and I got a helmet with that. It was a great way to explore. I thought it was going to be kind of tricky riding it for the first time but it was a lot of fun. You did well didn't you? It opened up a lot of the surrounding areas that would have been tough to reach by foot. Aside from chilling out and relaxing in Pai one of the few things that we actually really want to do is to take a trip over and visit the hot springs. We're here in Pai visiting the hot springs. This is the thirty five degree pool and I'm swinging like Tarzan. Well not exactly but I'd like to think that. Oooh Oooh Oooh! That giant white Buddha over there is something I plan on visiting tomorrow morning when I wake up. I can't swing. I need an assistant to swing me. Sam, come swing me! I'm just kidding. I'm kidding! No, Sam. Sam no! Oh, my gosh! What are you doing? Okay, I just want to get you on the hammock. I don't want to go flying! No. Okay, just go back on and say something. Go fetch me a drink! For the next two days we are doing a tour of Ha Long Bay, so here we are aboard our ship. Our lovely home at sea. So we're going to give you a tour of the place. Lounging on the deck. How are you enjoying the view? Ah, they're okay. So we've been doing lots of activities while we've been at Ha Long Bay. There has been kayaking and exploring caves and this morning we are spending a bit of time at a private beach. Okay, so Sam you are revisiting Ha Long Bay for the second time, yes? Indeed, I am. Okay, so tell us what has been your favorite part this time around and how has it changed? Well, it actually hasn't changed too much. This tour is quite similar to the one I did before. Previously, I did a three day tour. This time we're doing only two days. Two days I think is plenty. We've done a lot of different fun activities. I've just enjoyed being on the boat with all of the gorgeous scenery and the karst mountains. Well, this has been my first time to Ha Long Bay so obviously what has impressed the most has been the scenery because it just looks out of this world. It is unlike anything I've ever seen before. I've really enjoyed just hanging out on the top deck reading a book, checking out the views and also the food aboard has been really nice. And next we're going to show you our room on the boat. Hello. Cabin fever. Okay, we've been here maybe half an hour and it is already messy. I blame it on this person. No, this person. Today we setting out on a two day hike in Sapa and we are just walking through the town. We've picked up a few more people who are joining us and we've already picked up some local buddies who will be walking with us it seems. Today's hike is going to be divided into three sections and the first village that we will be visiting is called Lao Chai. It's about eight kilometers from where we started out and we're two kilometers into the trek so far. It is getting really hot and I'm sweaty so let's keep going. Tell us about the scenery? Unbelievable. Everywhere we walk. So as you can see over here there is a bit of a landslide that is blocking the road into the town. I thought I heard a waterfall down there. It turns out it is just a river. It is still impressive. So after several kilometers of hiking we're finally approaching the village of Lao Chai down below. So we are about to cross this bridge into town and it is not for those who have vertigo because there are railings on this bridge. After two hours of hiking we've reached our first destination point Lao Chai Village. It is time for lunch and I'm pretty hungry. How about you? I'm starving. I can't wait to get there fast enough. It is just over there where the bridge is. That is Lao Chai.",False,20150301 - Top 10 Things to do in Southeast Asia attractions travel guide.en.srt

This being our first winter trip we couldn't stop admiring the snow covered scenery out the window. It wasn't long before we reached Montreal – the midway point of our journey. After transferring trains we began the leg to Quebec City. What would a trip of ours be like without a little goofing off. The truth is we haven't traveled much in recent months and we were beyond excited to be heading somewhere. After transferring trains we began the leg to Quebec City. As many of you may already know, train travel is our preferred method of transportation. All snug and warm we could admire this winter wonderland without feeling the slightest bit cold. The scenery started to shift from farmland to forests and mountains.

And this is the view from the guesthouse I'm staying at in the Latin Quarter area. I'm stoked about going outside. I'm going to be doing all kinds of crazy stuff today. Hopefully some dog sledding, snowshoeing and maybe some skating. I'm also going to be devouring poutine and I can't wait to show you what a cool city Montreal is in the wintertime. It is seriously cold out today guys. I'm all bundled up but apparently with windchill it is almost minus thirty. Woo hoo! Check out those icicles. I'm starting to get some on my beard. I don't know if you can see it or not? I'm at Parc Lafontaine and there is just this incredible skating rink. Outdoors skating rink. And nobody is out here using it. If only I had my skates. What a fool for me not to bring them. I can't believe I didn't bring them. Oh, this is the best. There is a guy out there with his dog just gliding along the ice with his boots. He doesn't actually have skates on. Look at him sliding out there. That's awesome. I'm in serious need of some comfort food to warm up. It's time to head over for my morning poutine brunch. Oh, my precious - La Banquise - open twenty four seven for all your poutine needs. Now comes the hard part. There is such an extensive menu here that I don't know even know which one to choose. It is just seriously so nice to be warming up right now. My toes were starting to freeze, my beard as all frosty. This comfort food is going to do wonders for me. I think it is going to allow me to go outside and play around in the snow all day long. Oh my, the moment I've been waiting for. Everything I expected and more. La Banquise has the best poutine in Montreal. Woah, that seriously did not last long - pure gluttony over here. So this is one of the more unique entrances I've ever seen towards a subway station. Mickey Mouse is in the house. Hey guys, my life would not be complete without a Montreal bagel. Okay, now the million dollar question is should I go for a bagel sandwich or just go with spread on a bagel? Decisions, decisions. Alright, it's a raisin cinnamon bagel and apple cinnamon cream cheese for the win. Alright guys, time for the first bite. Mmmm. Amazing. So it appears we've got some snow cricket going on over hear. It doesn't get too much more Canadian than this. Oh. Yes, yes! Alright, it is time to complete the trifecta of must have foods when you're in Montreal. I'm going for - of course - a smoked meat sandwich. And when you want the best you come to Schwartz's. Seriously it pays to come here in the winter. The is the first time I've ever been here where there hasn't been a massive lineup. Now that really hit the spot. One thing to keep in mind when eating at these popular restaurants in Montréal is that some of them are cash only. You can only pay with cash. Some allow debit card but very few take credit card. Now it is time to burn some calories guys. It is kind of embarrassing thing for me to admit is that I consumed most of those calories within a two hour period. I'm at Mount Royal Park right now and there are all kinds of people doing totally different types of exercises from snowshoeing to cross country skiing to skating. So this is the reward for the long climb up Mount Royal. I'm near the top of the peak here and there is going to be some spectacular views. I just know it. And the last stop of the day is at Fête des neiges de Montréal.",False,20150118 - Things to do in Montreal Winter Travel Guide∩╝Ü One Day Itinerary For Visitors To Montreal.en.srt

So our first stop is going to be the street food market. I haven't eaten in maybe two hours, so it's time to get a snack. So you're officially starving. Starving. Ravenous! Background music playing. So what are you going to have? Some meat. Oh la la. On a stick? background music playing. Alright, happy boy with this meat. Let's see how this tastes. Hot? Very tender. Very smokey. Well seasoned. This is good stuff. So I notice that she put lots of spices while she was cooking this. It's really spicy! I'm just tasting that now. Oh, it's hot! Oh, that's got some nice kick to it. Really tasty. background music playing. Another favorite of yours. What are you having this time? We're getting the ever popular backpacker meal the banana pancake. Oh la la. This time Chinese style. background music playing. Alright, big bite. Piping hot. I can barely hold this. Mmmmmm. This is a different style. They actually smush the banana and put it right in the middle. As opposed to cutting it into little slices. Is it tasty? Yeah. It's good. If I had to choose between Guilin and Yangshuo the two most popular cities in this region it's definitely Yangshuo. It's a more historic town. It's a lot more pedestrian friendly and there are great things to eat here. Background music playing. Man playing flute. Lady playing flute. Background music playing. As we were wandering around the night market tonight we had lots of people come up to us and ask to take photos beside us. At least probably four or five times and we finally filmed the last one. It was really cool. We were like celebrities in China. Yeah, almost famous. So, this market had some pretty cool souvenirs. We saw fake Chinese passports if you want to take one of those home. They also had combs carved out of ox bone. They had these stamps where you can get your Chinese name carved on them and then you can just sign documents that way which is pretty cool. Today we are visiting a local hill tribe that just lives a few hours outside of Guilin and we've come here because this community is known for the women's long hair. They grow it out and it's almost a meter and a half long and we're actually going to be watching a performance where they spin their hair and wrap it up and show us how they wear it. Singing. Singing and music. Singing with announcer. Music and singing. Music playing. Chinese singing. Drumming. So that was one of the funniest performances to watch because I guess in this culture the women show the men they care for them by pinching their butts, so some foreigners got brought on stage to help demonstrate how things work and they were just having their little buns pinched and it was quite fun to watch. So Sam, you saw a bit of action today didn't you? I can't remember the last time I had my butt pinched that many times. So as part of the marriage ceremony the participants had to get up on stage and also sing to their brides. Luckily none of them seemed very shy. They did a good job. What if they had chosen you to go up and sing? Hahahaha. I would have butchered it. Today we're in between Guilin and Yangshuo and we're doing a special river cruise down the Li River. So this tour is going to be an hour and a half long and we're going to get to enjoy some pretty stunning landscapes, so I'm pretty excited about it. When I came here two years ago it was hazy and foggy. Now it's a gorgeous glorious day. Background music playing. Same same. Background music playing. Here we are at the Longji Rice Fields which are located just outside of Guilin. We've had such good luck. Check out the weather and the views behind. Background music playing. So we are hiking up to one of the viewing platforms. This is going to be tough because it's like forty degrees outside and we're been told it'll take 30 minutes to one hour depending on our pace. So I'm trying to stay hydrated. Audrey is going to have to workout today. Awwwww. It's tired. It's so cute. Hello! Background music playing. I don't know. Update number two. Still struggling. even sweatier but we're slowly gaining ground. Watch out! You may die along the way. And there is someone behind you. Sam over here just met a cat. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Who can meow the loudest? Well, thankfully we've been training for these steps at our hostel. We're on the fifth floor so we're used to going up and down the stairs everyday. And we tend to forget things which means we have to run up and down multiple times a day. True story. We just went the wrong way so now we have to go down all of these steps. And back up. Background music playing. Well, that concludes our sweat fest. I mean trek. It was great I just wish it could have been twenty degrees cooler. Background music playing. Purrrrr Okay, so it's early morning here in Yangshuo. It's about eight o'clock and the town is still sleepy. There is hardly any people on the street, so we're going to go have breakfast at our favorite Israeli restaurant and then we're going to bike around the area. Background music playing. We've only been in Yangshuo for three days yet we've eaten at this very restaurant seven times. Cafe Mimosa. What is so amazing about it? When it's good, it's good. You come back. So what are we having for breakfast this morning? Let's see. Well, my favorite feature here are two things. We've got homemade fresh banana bread. MMMM. It's just got so many nuts and different ingredients in it. It's really tasty. really healthy. And then anytime I can get my hands on hummus in the morning. Oh my. With fresh pita. Fresh, fresh, fresh. We have some museli. I got myself some eggs and a nice cup of tea. We're happy. Background music playing. One of the best views in Yangshuo is unfortunately by the Ronald McDonald. Background music playing. Chinese music playing in the park. We've rented a couple of bikes and we've decided to spend our last morning exploring around the countryside areas of Yangshuo. They were pretty cheap. Just under two dollars for each bike. Background music playing. Hello. Hello. So we've been biking for a while now and we've reached the countryside, so we're just taking a little break here by this lily pond. Background music playing. So now after a long bike ride we're just hanging out on the rooftop of our hostel Monkey Jane and it has some amazing views. Check it out. Background music playing. So we finally made it to Guilin. We've been waiting for things to cool down and now that it is evening we're going to give you a little tour of the place. Background music playing. So I'm not sure we want to be walking through that tunnel when it gets a bit later in the day because it is pretty dark in there and there are no lights. And people aren't using their headlights. Background music playing. When I was in Guilin two years ago this area right here used to all be traditional homes. One of my favorite restaurants was here. A really good Chinese restaurant. I used to love wandering around here. Now it's just new development. Background music playing. So this is the Guilin main square. It gets really busy here at night. Lots of shops, restaurants, eateries. You can do it all here. Background music playing. Chinese singing. Background music playing. So we are now at the lake and the main attraction are the these two pagodas that light up at night. Background music playing. Oh, that mapo tofu looks so good. Really generous sized portion. Mix it in with my rice a bit. Please don't be course. Oh hot! Oh hot! Too hot to handle? It's nice and spicy. Really flavorful. Fresh tofu. Mmmmmmm. What are you having over there? Over here I've got deep fried taro balls. And as you can see they have a generous amount of caramel sauce. Really sweet and delicious. Really crunchy on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside. Really sweet. Delicious. It's almost like a dessert. Honking noises. Well, that's our first night in Guilin. I think we're both ready to get some rest and tomorrow we're going to visit some rice terraces, so we'll make a video there. Well, it's hard to believe but our time in Hong Kong has already expired. Today we're taking a train ride. Where are we going? We're crossing over into China. Hong Kong, of course, is a part of China but this is a Special Administrative Region, so we're actually going through immigration to get into Mainland China today. This is the first time we've taken a train where we've had to go through immigration to cross somewhere, so this should be interesting. Background music playing. We are in Guangzho. Apparently there are two train stations. We arrived at the one that is on the East End of the City and we had to get across town to the other and it was difficult but we need to keep going. Background music playing. So right now we are in Guangzho station waiting for our train to Guilin. And we happen to be waiting in the VIP room. Background music playing. There is no tea in this tea room. We're going to Guilin. Uh, we're looking for number ten. Background music playing. So we're in the dining cart now getting ready to have dinner. Let's see what is on the menu if we can even read it. We barely got a seat here. Background music playing. Decision time. So we did manage to find an English menu which makes things a lot easier. Background music playing. Fish one. Tofu with pork. One. Okay. Rice. One Rice? Okay. Beer. One. Okay. Ah, green tea - one. okay. background music playing. So this is the friend fish with a sweet and sour sauce. It's got some pineapple on top And then we have the pork with tofu over here which looks really tasty and some rice to go along with it. And of course a beer. Sam had to get his beer. Taking the skin off. Trying to get at the meat. There it is. Mmmmm. It's nice and salty. Well, how are you enjoying that tofu? It's not bad. It's really spicy. Background music playing. Good morning. We are almost in Guilin. Our train has been delayed about an hour and a half. So we're just hanging out in the dining cart. Breakfast isn't being served for some reason so we're just enjoying what is left over of our snacks from yesterday, so a few salty peanuts. These little hazelnut cakes. Water chestnut cakes? Yeah. And that's about it. Background music playing.",False,"20150112 - Things to do in China Travel Guide∩╝Ü Guangxi Province (Guilin, Yangshuo, Li River, Rice Terraces).en.srt"

So we're on the tram now and we're traveling all the way up to Victoria Peak and it's really steep. Background music playing. Well, well what do you think? We're so high up it's scary. I'm not going near the edge. Background music playing. So we took the tram all the way up and it was a bit of a scary ride because it is super steep and you're kind of leaning back in your seat kind of holding on to the rail in front of you. But we survived and the views are pretty impressive. Like once we got up here we had to go through a mall like just several levels and now we're up here on top and it's a beautiful sunny day. It's nice. How many time have you been here? This is my second time here. My first time here was 2008. My very first time I went backpacking, so that's a long time ago. Has it changed a lot? Well, there is some new buildings obviously yeah. So the skyline has changed a little bit but when I came before it was late at night and this place was packed. It's nice to come around this of day between say four and six o'clock because there is hardly anyone here. We can find little quiet areas to just rest in the shade. It's great. Hong Kong without a doubt has the most impressive skyline I've ever seen. Just phenomenal. Background music playing. So our first video from Macau. We finally made it here and we are starting off in Senado Square. We're going to be exploring the area on foot and taking you along. Because this was a former Portuguese settlement all of the signs are in Portuguese and in Chinese. One of the first things I noticed about Macau are the very Portuguese tiles that they have and these black and white mosaic tiles can be found in Brazil and also in Portugal, so let's look at them. We're now here at the most distinct landmark in all of Macau - it is the Saint Paul ruins. Here I am taking refuge in the shade. I'm melting like a Popsicle. I can't believe people are actually jogging in this weather. Insanity! Right now we're just walking up Fortaleza do Monte which is a fortress on top of a hill overlooking the city. And it is super hot and it is super steep and we're sweating. Here we're taking aim at one of the biggest casinos. Here we've got our canon and a ball inside ready to blast. Which one are we blasting? That is the Grand Lisboa. The long climb up here was definitely worth it. Now we get some great views of the casinos and apartments below. Well, I've been to Macau one time before but this is your first time, so first impressions. First impressions, it reminds me a little bit of Las Vegas of course because of all of the casinos but it also has a bit of a Brazilian and a Portuguese flavor. It reminds me a lot of my visits to Rio and the food is great so I'm liking it so far. It is so ridiculously hot and humid outside. We've been literally subsisting off of these pearl milk teas. Another one, what do you mean? Another one. Refreshing. Background music playing. We're hungry in Hong Kong and that can only mean one thing. We're going out for lunch and we're going to eat dim sum. So we're going to be eating at Tim Ho Wan it's a Michelin Star restaurant here in Mong Kok in Hong Kong and it's one of our favorite places. We've been here, I don't know, maybe five times in the span of week, so we're going to show you what you can get inside. Background music playing. So they have a pretty cool menu over here. Thankfully it's in English not just Chinese, so when you first sit down at the table you just check-off the food items you'd like to order, you specify a quantity and then they bring it to your table as it is ready. Background music playing. Tasty Pu-erh tea from Yunnan Province, it's a dark fermented tea. My oh my, all of the food is arriving at once and over here we have a special little package with sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf and this rice comes with beef and chicken. It's really tasty. One of our favorites. Steaming hot. Background music playing. This is going to be hot. Hahaha! Oh, it is hot. I need a second to tell you about it. So yeah, this sticky rice is really good. I think it's actually called glue rice on the menu and it just has a very sticky consistency as you can see. You can just pick it up with chopsticks and it's been cooked with meat and chicken, so it has a nice meaty flavor to it. Out of all the different kinds of dim sum I've ever tried this is probably one of the most filling by far. Background music playing. Well, we certainly polished that off except for the bone. So next up I'm trying the glutinous rice dumping filled with meat. It's been deep-fried. Ow, hot. Everything is hot. Mmmmm. Well, you can't see the inside right now but it does have meat. Let me prove it. You can see it there. Mmmm. Looks good. It's like a ball of sticky rice with meat inside. Background music playing. And when it comes to dim sum this is my all-time personal favorite the barbecue pork bun. But this is a special variety of it baked barbecue pork bun. So, bite time. Mmmmm. Show us the inside. Ooooh, look at that barbecue pork. Yum. It's just so sweet and flavorful. The inside. The barbecue pork bun. And the outside of the bun it's so delicately crispy. Well, we've got one more dish coming. It is called tonic and pedelar cake. How does that sound to you? MMMMnnnn. Let me correct you on that. It's called tonic, medlar and petal cake as in flower petals. So I'm not really sure what to expect maybe something that tastes like perfume. And it was from the dessert section. Background music playing. I really hope Iike it. It's cold. Like gelatin. Sweet like honey. Michelin star quality that even a cheapskate extraordinaire can afford. Lets see the total. So that is 77 Hong Kong dollars which is just under 10 US dollars. Today we're on a quest for Macanese food. We love to eat and we're always excited to try new things. Background music playing. So this little treat over here is called and it is a popular Portuguese pastry made with eggs. And I'm going to have my first bite. It's kind of Macanese food egg tart. Chinese and Portuguese inspired. How is it? It's nice and sweet and the egg is really fluffy. Almost like a souffle. What do got there? A piece of meat. Is it good? It's like bacon. So time for our second treat of the day. And we found a quiet little back alley away from some of the busy main pedestrian areas. And we've got some almond cakes here. These are also a Macanese specialty. Oh yeah, those are real good. They remind me of Christmas shortbread cookies that you have for the winter holidays. That sounds tasty. Melt in the mouth. Let's look at those again. Yum. Background music playing. So we're here at a local eatery just down a backstreet in Macau and we're here to try a pork chop bun and we've also been given a black soy milk drink, so we'll see what that is all about. Okay, first I'm trying soy milk in my whole life. Mmmm is it sweet? This is sweet, yeah. Does it have a kind of a rich flavor? I don't know. You try it. Yeah, it definitely tastes like sweetened soy milk. A little bit similar to almond milk as well. I can also taste the black bean a little bit too. Background music playing. Time to try this famous pork chop bun here in Macau. Mmmmmm. That's really nice. Is it? It's a soft warm bun fresh out of the oven. I think it may have some butter. And the pork is just so flavorful. Save some for me. No. So it's starting to get really hot outside so we treated ourselves to a nice little pearl tea. Um, I think the origins of this are actually Taiwanese but it's really popular here in Macau, so we're adding it to the video. Background music playing. Background music playing. We're at the Avenue of Stars here and a Symphony of Lights show is just about to begin. We better walk fast in order to get a good spot. Wait, can I gather my thoughts first. So we already saw the Symphony of Lights Show once before when we took a tour of the harbor. We just finished our bus tour and we've been let off at the Avenue of the Stars, so we're going to grab a spot and watch the show from the land. Background music playing. The Avenue of stars features many special statues. None more iconic than the Bruce Lee one. Who is Bruce Lee? I don't think I've ever seen a film of his. Background music playing. As you can see there is a huge audience here all lined up waiting to see a Symphony of Lights show. Background music playing. The world's longest running light and lazer show. Music playing and crowd cheering. Background music playing. Music, cheering, and clapping. Background music playing. Rock music performance. Background music playing. Yeah! Woo Hoo! Background music playing. Music playing. Violin playing. I think of Ace Venture when I hear this song. We ended up having to wait two hours to get a table here in the Tea Salon. Initially they told us it would only be a one hour wait but by the time one hour had passed we had waited so long that we figured it was probably worth it to stay and now Sam is not very pleased. He's looking at me with evil eyes. Are you freaking kidding me. Sam is hiding behind the camera because he's so angry that he had to wait for two hours. That now I'm being punished by having to be on camera all alone. Okay, so if your'e looking to go afternoon tea in Hong Kong. The Peninsula is the place to come. This is the oldest hotel in all of Hong Kong and it's super popular. The lineups really speak for themselves. background music playing. Symphony orchestra. Mmmm, so I got my self a nice little tea cup of mango tea. And it smells like fresh mangoes. So good. Mmmm, tropical. Background music playing. We've already dug into the food. We couldn't help it. If you go to the bottom here we have the scones which we can eat with the clotted cream and jam. Over here we have some nice finger sandwiches with salmon, cucumber and up top we have the cakes and the macaroons and lots of other treats. So here I'm preparing my scones with clotted cream and jam. This is a favorite of mine. Whenever I go to London to visit my friend Rebecca I always end up staying at her house and I eat scones with clotted cream and jam three times a day. I eat it for breakfast, for lunch and also for my late night snack. So I always get fat when I go over there. Symphony music playing. Background music playing. The food was amazing. I think it was definitely worth the two hour wait. Although, I would have preferred not having to wait that long. Some favorites were the little lemon meringue tarts in a chocolate shell. Plus I really liked the scones with the clotted cream. Then they had sandwiches with salmon that were amazing. So I'm a happy girl. So I think it's kind of funny that we had to wait two hours in line but it only took us 30 minutes to finish off all of the food in front of us. That doesn't make sense. So this morning we're taking one of the Big Bus Tours around Hong Kong and we're going to be doing the loop around Hong Kong Island starting here from the pier. Background music playing. Background music playing. Well, we made it to Hong Kong and tonight we're going to be taking a fun tour around the harbor where we're going to see some amazing views of the Hong Kong skyline. Background music playing. I've got my glass of wine. White wine and I'm ready to enjoy the views. background music playing. Every night here in Hong Kong there is a Symphony of Lights show that starts at eight o'clock and it's really spectacular. All of the buildings light up and there is these lasers that are shooting off and music. It's not to be missed. Background music playing. We had a great time on the Aqua Luna. It was awesome to see all of the different sights and the buildings all lit up with the light show and we got to enjoy that with a nice glass of wine. It was my first time in Hong Kong and I thought the views were unbeatable so I definitely recommend it if you're in the city. Background music playing. So we just got on the ferry. We are traveling from Macau to Hong Kong. We had tickets with Turbo Jet and the cool thing is that if you show up early you can on standby and if there is room on the ferry you just hop on board. Yeah, and we got on and we are taking the hydrofoil. This is going to be a fast high speed ride that should only take forty five minutes to an hour. Background music playing. This Turbo Jet is a high performance gazelle. I'm not having fun. High performance gazelle. We're bouncing up and down. Background music playing. And why are you filling in my Immigration card? Because Sam can't really write. It looks like chicken scratch. Hahaha! This is the truth. It's a true story. Background music playing. The seas are really choppy today so we're treating my seasickness with a cup of noodle soup. It seems to be a cure all for every problem we have. Food! background music playing. Background music playing. Dim Sum Square! We're been walking for what feels like at least an hour to find this place. We actually ate over here yesterday when we took a food tour of the city and it was amazing. So Sam wanted to find it again. And we didn't have any map or any directions with us, so we have to kind of place it by memory. And we did a good job. Yes, we're here. Let's go eat. So this place has a pretty cool menu. They just give you a slip of paper and you check off which food items you'd like to have. Fortunately, this one also has English writing, so it makes our job much easier. Let's see. background music playing. So if you've been following along with our food videos for a while you'll probably remember we had Dim Sum several times in Malaysia. It was excellent but this is where Dim Sum originated from. From Hong Kong. And it's just a notch better. So in many of the other dim sum restaurants we've been to especially in Malaysia they come around to your table with push carts and you're able to select what kind of Dim Sum you'd like to eat. But because we're here in Hong Kong and space is so limited you have to order from a menu and they just bring it to your table. There is no way they can push a little cart around in this small confined space. So Dim Sum literally means small bite and if you were to invite someone out for dim sum you would actually invite them out for tea. background music playing. So this is my favorite one. The shrimp dumpling. Even though I normally don't like seafood. I don't like shrimp. It's okay when it is in dumpling form. I'm going to dip it there. This is really hot. Still steamy. Nice and plump. Background music playing. So this here is a new one we're trying. I've never had this before. It's a deep fried glutinous rice ball with pork stuffing inside. So I can already tell it's crispy. That is sooo sooo good! It's almost a bit like a mini meat pie but it's got that stickiness of the glutinous rice inside. Oh, it's so good. Oooh, more food. Background music playing. So this is another favorite of ours. It's called the crispy barbecue pork bun. And what Iike about it is almost sugar coated. It's really sweet on the outside and the barbecue sauce inside is also quite sweet. So it feels like a dessert even though it is meat. Mmmmmm. It's nice and fluffy like a pastry. Like a French pastry. Oh, yeah. What do you got there? Mango pudding for dessert. It's not homemade. I was expecting a little homemade bowl but its nice. So this wonderful dim sum feast which consisted of four different dishes and tea only came to seventy two Hong Kong dollars which was a steal. Basically that's less than ten US dollars to feed both of us. So today we're doing a Sampan boat tour in an area known as Aberdeen outside of central Hong Kong. This is an area that is home to the Tangka people or the boat people who actually live aboard these little ships, so it'll be an interesting outing. And there are over six hundred junk boats still in this area. Some of them enjoy modern amenities such as internet and tv. Background music playing. Background music playing. So we're back on the Big Bus again this time we're doing a night tour and I'm really excited about this one especially because Hong Kong really shines at night. It's an amazing city by day but there is just something spectacular about it at night time. Delicious double chocolate brownie cookies. Best enjoyed on top of a double decker bus. Hahaha. Background music playing. Background music playing. Background music playing. Background music playing. There are many ways to get around Hong Kong. This is the Star Ferry. It's super convenient. It's a boat that comes by roughly every seven minutes. It's really cheap. You just hop on and it takes you from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island or vice versa. Background music playing. So it's finally a beautiful sunny day here in Hong Kong, so today we're visiting Hong Kong Park. Background music playing. So it's one hundred and five steps to the top. We're going to show you some views of Hong Kong and I'm going to beat because he's too slow. Background music playing. It was definitely worth climbing up all those stairs even though I lost because these are some of the best free views of the city. background music playing. I'm kind of hoping Sam gets wet here. Get wet Sam. background music playing. So we got to Hong Kong about three days ago and it had been raining non-stop for those three days but now the skies have finally cleared so it's really nice to be able to walk around and enjoy the park.. Background music playing. Oh, it's too fat. Oh! That squirrel is in trouble. It's so funny. So we've signed up to take part in a few different cultural activities while we're here in Hong Kong and today we're doing a Chinese tea appreciation ceremony. This is taking place in Hong Kong Park. There is a little tea house just in the center of the park and it's absolutely free of charge. You just need to sign up in advance through the Hong Kong Tourism board. background music playing. Now we're outside of the infamous Chungking Mansions. This place is notorious in Hong Kong. It is where all foreigners seem to pass through. It is the cheapest place to eat, the cheapest place to get a room. You name it and you can do it here. This really is the most random place ever. You can get laundry done, you can get keys made and you can buy electronics. There is people selling phone cards. You can get about a zillion different curries here. Yes, currency exchange. There is just so much happening. We've settled on an Indian restaurant here in one of the quieter areas of the mansion. This is actually one of the only enclosed restaurants where you can get something to eat. Samosa! Our Indian food has arrived here. And there is more coming. Oh, wow! This is the butter chicken. My samosa which is fresh. It is burning my fingers. Is it good? It's hot. Spicy? No, just hot hot. Nothing like a mango lassi to cool off on a hot day. Is that your chicken tikka? Yeah. Really good. So tender. I'm really enjoying this meal. This is butter naan fresh out of the oven. Fluffy. The curry is nice and spicy. One happy girl? Yeah, the experience there was okay. It's a pretty local joint and we had people staring at us the whole time. We didn't really get to comfortably sit down and enjoy our meal that much. But the food was good. It was okay. Background music playing. We got so bored staying in China that we decided to change things up. Now we're in Venice, Italy. Actually we just crossed the street from our hotel in Macau and now we're visiting the Venetian. So we're still in China. Background music playing. So even if you're not a huge gambler there is still plenty to do in Cotai Central here in Macau. There are so many hotels that you can visit and every hotel usually has a unique show that they put on. Here at the Venetian you can ride the Gondola and just feel like you're in Italy for an afternoon. Then the hotel we were staying at was having some kind of Shrek parade which you missed out on. I did miss it but Sam loved it. Oh wow, yes! There is just lots of shows and different performances that you can attend in the evenings. So plenty to do aside from gambling. Coming early in the morning was a really good idea. We basically almost have this whole place to ourselves. background music playing. Well, Macau is a place where dreams come true. You make a little wish and throw your coin into the water. Being the high roller that I am. I've got a Macau ten cent piece here. Which I'm going to throw. Missed it. You missed it? Nice. And of course 1 baht. what? Great camera work on the coin toss. I got the splash at the end. The after splash. Background music playing. Background music playing. Very exciting afternoon over here. We're leaving our apartment in Mong Kok and we're going to walk over to the Chinese Embassy to see if our Visas for China have been approved or not. So keeping our fingers crossed. Background music playing. The reason we're a little bit concerned is that the Visa process has changed for getting a Visa. Now for China you need more documents. You need to be able to prove you can get out of China. You also need to be able to prove accomodation for your first night there. So our problem is that our train tickets don't actually match our final destination because we weren't able to purchase train tickets to Guilin from Hong Kong. We actually need to be in China in order to do so. So we're going to see how that works out. Hopefully they are not too picky about the application. So the agent who is taking care of our Visa process for us didn't sound very confident, so I'd say there is a 50-50 chance we're going to get our Visas or not. So we're going to find out soon. Well, I'm convinced we're going to get the Visa because I'm a little bit more optimistic than Sam over here. So what is your probability? 98%. background music playing. So these are the people that are going to decide our travel fate. Let's go find out. Ooooh. Bad news. We got em!!! Yeah! Hahaha! We're going to China. Background music playing. We're getting Taiwanese milk tea with tapioca pearls. I've become addicted to it since I got to Macau and Hong Kong. Is this your way of celebrating? Background music playing. We're going to China. We're going to China. Background music playing. Background music playing. We haven't made any videos in a while because I've been back in Canada for a few weeks visiting family but now I am back in Thailand, so we've packed up our little apartment and we're going to be traveling again. And next up is a big trip through Macau, Hong Kong and China. You look like a camel. I'm carrying more than a camel. Anyways, I can't believe our time in Chiang Mai is already over. It feels like we just got here. Background music playing. What are you most looking forward to? I'm going to eat a lot. That's my plan wherever I go. Come on. What kind of question is that? I got a present. It's like Christmas at the airport over here. Why did you get a present? Well, we had to fill out a survey and in exchange we got this cute little elephant. Aaahhh. Isn't that nice. To pass time before we boarded our plane we ended up doing a whole bunch of different surveys and so we acquired some new souvenirs for our backpacks. background music playing. So while I was in Canada I got a brand new passport and look at the pages. They have designs. Oh, Canadian history. What do you know about Canadian history? Not much. Background music playing. One of the coolest features of our apartment in Chiang Mai was that we could look out of our window and see all of the airplanes taking off. Just like we're doing right now. Background music playing. So we're here. We made it to Macau. We're alive. We had to fly through a storm and it there was lightening and turbulence. I was terrified. Yes. So we're looking forward to not flying again for at least another month. Month and a half. Yeah, we'll be taking the trains. Yeah. But we recently derailed on a train, so we're not having much luck are we? No. So we're going to be in Macau for three days. We're really looking forward to just getting a good night sleep and exploring tomorrow. background music playing.",False,20141231 - Top Things to do in Hong Kong and Best Things to do in Macau Travel Guide.en.srt

Edinburgh Edinburgh Edinburgh Edinburgh So we still don't quite know how to pronounce the name of the city. As a Canadian, I would be saying Edinburgh but I keep hearing the locals saying Edinburgh, so that's what we are going to go with for the rest of our videos. Well, as you can probably tell we're not in Kansas anymore and by Kansas I mean Chiang Mai, Thailand. Look at what we're wearing. In our winter clothes. Today we're exploring Edinburgh for the first time. This is our first impressions video. Background music playing. The views of the castle are phenomenal from here. It's time to go climb up for an even better vantage point. And to get there we're going to Granny's Green steps. Background music playing. Screw this hat. I've got myself a proper Scottish winter trapper. More like I've inherited his hat. Background music playing. I'm feeling the Christmas spirit here in Edinburgh. Background music playing. To go on the Ferris Wheel it's going to be a ten minute ride and hopefully we'll some nice views of the city. And we are moving. Woo hoo! And we're only half way there. We're going to even go higher up. Are you scared? Yes, and we're not even at the top yet. We don't like heights at all. We're probably using up all of our courage points doing this. Oh, yes. All for the viewers right? Background music playing. Well there has been a lot of ginger sightings here in Edinburgh. I fit right in. Background music playing. Background music playing. So today we're going to be doing a tour with Haggis Adventures. We're up in the Scottish Highlands and we're going to be visiting some of the main sites around this area. Background music playing. Every time I come here I always get really emotional. I can't explain it. It's a place that is very very close to my heart. This is the battlefield. No jokes. No humor. Guys. This is a massive war grave where my ancestors and other people's ancestors died needlessly. So, just respect it guys. As you're making your way through here. It's the same as if you go over to Europe and you go to these Second World War places. Just utmost total respect. Background music playing. A big massive shield and a big ginger beard. And long hair. Quite intimidating, eh? Boom. Five of you guys have just been disemboweled. Now you guys over here boomfff. I probably just slit through your jugulars. So with one man I could have taken out eight red coat soldiers. That's why the Highlanders were known. The people come here. They sing songs. They tell stories. And they remember. If you guys were to come here just after the 16th of April all the way around this would be five hours and things like that. On the anniversary of the battle during the day they bring a little piper out who is actually blind. And they bring him up here and he stands here for forty five minutes and he plays songs on the bagpipes for forty five minutes. The length that the battle lasted for. And I dare any of you to come and stand next to him and not cry because I did and it is just such an emotional thing. There is just silence and all you can hear is the pipes just playing through and you're just looking around you can just imagine it happening. And it does really really tug on your heart strings because war is such a terrible thing and one thing is guaranteed with war is death. Death and destruction. really really sad. These flags here. The three lions represent the connection to England. fleur de lis a connection to France. And the flower is the connection to Ireland. I think it's quite cool. So this is the Royal standard of King James. If I had to stand here in this battle field 250 years ago and I was flying this flag I would have been taken for treason and hung and killed. This is pretty cool actually. And another interesting thing that one of the Jacobite generals did. If I had saw this being a Jacobite soldier this would have inspired me to have courage and morale. He actually led a charge into the front line against the British government army. Snapped his sword in two, lost his horse. Came back out of the front line of the British government army. Got another sword, go another horse and led a second charge in. Now to me that's balls. If I had of been there and I saw one of my generals acting like that I'd have been YEAH! Come on let's go! He's also the patron Saint of Russia and he's the patron saint of Greece as well. So he's not just exclusive to Scotland. This flag is very important as well. Background music playing. clava cairns. Pffff. There isn't actually much to say about this place because it's a mystery. You still have people coming here in the winter solstice with professor suits on and they all argue with one another basically. Eh, these chambers are older than the Pyramids. They were built by teenagers because the life expectancy back then would have only been about 30 years old. So these tombs were built by teenagers. Now you might have had a dome coming over the top as well. And as you can see the sun is actually just setting right over there. And I believe it's either in the summer solstice or the winter solstice that the sun actually sets in alignment here and the sun beam comes right down in this chamber and there would have been a fire and smoke and all of us would have been sitting in here. So image that beam of light coming in and all of this room started filling up with a smoke and light and things like that. Very very very spiritual. People who come here. If they take any of these rocks from these cairns and take it back to whatever it is they are from bad things happen to them. So much so people actually come back here and replaced the rocks. So there is your disclaimer guys. Don't take any of the rocks. Hahaha. Don't go on facebook. Dave my arms is falling off! I did tell you not to take the rocks. Hahaha! You have been warned. Background music playing. Background music playing. After the rising you had 1719. Spain and England are shall we say had an alliance with one another and voided that alliance, so Spain decided to play the Jacobite card. They spent 300 of their crack Spanish mountain troops to help the highlanders. Thank you very much Spain! Woo! They went down to the eilendon castle which is where I'll be taking you shortly. Unfortunately, for the Scots and the Spanish we were defeated, so it was another failure and arising. Thanks for trying to help us guys. Hahaha. So it's quite crazy to think guys that there were was actually Spanish soldiers fighting here. That's why we've said about Jacobitism being part of Scotland. As I said, Bonnie Prince Charlie was offered to become King of America, so an International dimension as well. What a beautiful place for a battle guys. What a beautiful place for a battle. Background music playing. Wind blowing. So today is day two of our tour of the Scottish Highlands. The blue skies are gone and it is rainy, cold and the weather is just very Scottish and dramatic. So our first stop of the day is eilean donan castle and that's just right behind us. Brrrr. When I'm cold you know it's really cold. Oh yeah! Bone chilling, wet and damp right now. Background music playing. Aside from just the impressive Castle there is also wonderful views here. Background music playing. Wind blowing. SO we've just been warming up in a pub right now. It is really cold, damp, wet and windy outside, so we've got tea for two and we've ordered some traditional pub fare. Background music playing. I actually quite like the damp and the rain because it reminds me so much of home where I grew up on Vancouver Island. background music playing. It is super windy. Our guide Dave this is the windiest he's ever seen it here. I bet you can barely hear me right now. Wind noises. Background music playing. Background music playing. Today is day three of our Haggis Tour adventure and we've had all kinds of weather. On day one it was pristine conditions - sunny blue skies and day two was insane. Howling winds, rain, chilly and today we have a nice overcast day. And we've got great views from the back of the mountains. So the snowy peak we have over in the background is Ben Nevis and it is the highest peak in the UK. It's a real treat that we can see it today. Background music playing. So here is inverlochy castle which dates back to the. So we've just been wandering around the ruins and seeing what is left of it even now. Background music playing. And just behind us we have the three sisters. There is not much explaining to do the scenery speaks for itself. Background music playing. So we're visiting the William Wallace Memorial. Fans of Brave Heart will certainly know who this is. What was interesting was that our guide actually told us that many of the scenes in Brave Heart were actually historically inaccurate. Background music playing. Background music playing. It's our first meal in Scotland, so we've decided to go with something very typical. We're going to be eating the National dish, which is Haggis. So let's go into Whisky Room. So today's meal is all about Haggis. We are starting with Haggis spring rolls. So let's see what those are like. We've had a lot of spring rolls lately in Thailand, Vietnam and other places in SE Asia. Mmmmmm. Never Haggis. And it's also the first time trying haggis. Oh, so hot! Is it hot? Mmmmmm. I'm pleasantly surprised. Oh, yeah. Haggis is good people! Those are hot. Mmmmmm. Wow, so many flavors. It's delicious. I think I've found myself my new favorite spring roll. Haggis spring rolls. Background my playing. So for those of you who aren't familiar with Haggis it's a savory pudding made with sheep's pluck. And that means a sheep's heart, liver and lungs. And if that doesn't sound appetizing enough it's wrapped in the sheep's stomach and it also includes spices and some oats and onions. So that's what we're going to be trying. Background music playing. It's time to cover this bad boy in some gravy. Oh my, oh my. Look at that. So Haggis is served with neeps and tatties, which is basically turnips and potatoes. First bite. So I've got lots of haggis here. Neeps and tatties. Lots of gravy. The verdict. It's awesome. Yeah. That's not an acquired taste. I love it on the very first bite. Do you like it as much as I do? It's a really nice rich winter dish. And like normally I don't like organs. I've had liver before and it has a very strong flavor but somehow when it's all mixed together and they add spices and the gravy it's perfect. I like it. I like haggis! And it's a cold day today so I'm trying something else very Scottish here. It's a nice warm drink. It's called a Hot Toddy. It's got hot water, whisky, lemon and honey. And that sounds good to me. Take a sip. Oh yeah. It goes down nice. Okay, First sip of the Hot Toddy. I'm not I've ever even tried this whiskey. So let's how it is in a hot drink. Ooooh. It's nice. It really warms you up but it's not a strong and overpowering as I thought it would be. This is nice. And it's also very aromatic because they've put some cloves along with the lemon. Like Christmas. So far you're liking Scottish food. Yeah. Background music playing. Background music playing. What's your name? Sam. Sam how you doing man? We're doing a deep-fried snickers, a Twix and we've already done a Mars bar already. Awesome. I'm going to unwrap it. Stick it in the batter. I can't tell you that because it's my secret. Hahaha...secret recipe? Of course. The Twix. One. Two. Mix it around. Give it a little shake. And there it goes. Ah, that looks good. Now for the Twix. Here is the Twix. There you go. How long do you put them in there? Emmmm, we just keep it about...2 or 3 minutes. We fry them separately. This is just for the Mars bars. Mars bars only. Awesome. So the temperature. This is 170 degrees. And while the batter cooks the chocolate will melt. So the batter will cook before the chocolate. Ahhh, perfect. That's so cool. So we've been hearing lots about the Mars bars but Sam here went overboard and tried three different chocolate bars that have been deep fried. So what do you have? Well, at the recommendation of the guy at the chip shop. He recommended I also try the Snickers and the Twix bar, so we've got it all right here. Let's unwrap that. I don't want to drop it here. Okay. Let's see that thing of beauty. Isn't that gorgeous. Alright, so which is which? So I believe this is the Snickers. We've got the two Twixes here and that is the Mars bar. Alright. And you're feeling a little queasy today, so I'm going to be the one trying them all. Yes, you are. Enjoy! So first up. And you can tell they really feel as though they've been deep-fried and melted. This is flimsy in the hand. Ewww. Yeah, this is a Mars bar. I can tell from what is seeping out. Take a bite. Oh, Wow. That is so much better than just having it on its own. It's all melted inside. It's gooey. And you've got the crispiness from the batter on the outside. Mmmmmm. One more bite. Next up Twix. Next up we have the Twix. This one is a little longer. Oh yeah. Is it still crunchy? Yeah, it's still crunchy on the inside. You can see this. All the chocolate has melted on the outside. It's just so much better than having it normally. And the best for last. Best for last. My favorite of all these bars is the Snickers, so I have high expectations for the deep-fried version here. The battered version. Oh yeah. It just melts. All caramel and chocolate inside and the peanuts. Oh,. Let's see the inside of it? That is amazing. Okay, so you've tried all three. Which was our favorite? Definitely the Snickers. Why? Because I love Snickers bars and this just enhanced it. So, it's not surprising that taking something that is already unhealthy and making it even unhealthier would make it taste better. Music playing. So this afternoon we are going to be doing a little bit of a taste test. So we've raided a Scottish supermarket and picked out some items that we thought looked very local. So we're going to try those and see what they're like. Yeah, overall we've got five different things. Two beverages and three things to eat. So first up I'm going to be trying something called Irn Bru and apparently after Whisky this is Scotland's second national drink and it looks like a regular fizzy drink. It kind of looks like it could be orange flavored but I hear it's just sweet and doesn't really taste like fruit. Oh, I'm going to need help opening this. Hahahaha Rawwwr. Thank you kindly. So it smells very sweet and sugary. It doesn't smell like orange. Hahaha. It's a bit like cream soda maybe. It's just really really sweet. Like sweeter than Pepsi or 7Up. Oh yeah? Yeah, it reminds me a lot of cream soda as well. Which isn't my favorite beverage, so overall I don't think I'm going to be an Irn Bru man anytime soon. Next up we've got Mackie's of Scotland's Haggis and cracked black pepper flavored chips or crisps as they like to call them here. Right, exactly. Chips here would be referring to like french fries, so we're going to call these crisps. Let's open it up here. It's going to be like Kettle style chips. Crisps, I mean. Kettle style crisps. Let's try this. You can tell that has a smokey flavor. Can you taste the Haggis? Ummmm, yeah, kind of but I mean it has more of a an all dressed smokey flavor in my opinion. I do like them. Why won't you be trying any of those delectable crisps? Well, I got really sick shortly after eating Haggis, so just the name, just the sound of Haggis kind of makes my stomach turn a little bit, so I'm staying away from haggis flavored chips this time around, which is good for me because I get to eat them all. I like them. Good. And what do we have here? Next up we have Crabbie's. Here in the back it says that it is best served chilled with ice and lemon but we have neither of those. Room temperature? And actually we don't even know if this is Scottish or not but I think so. Let's assume. It says following in the pioneering footsteps of the first Scots. Well, there we go. And what is it? I think it's a Ginger beer isn't it? Ginger beer, okay. With alcohol. Hmmmmm, what does that mean? Ginger beer. Hahahaha. That's exactly what is is. It tastes very gingery? Yes, I don't love beer, so I'm not going to say I love it but it's a nice smell. It smells like ginger tea. Tell me how you like it? Oh yeah, I like that a lot. It's got a very. It's quite sweet. I mean normally beer doesn't have this sweet of a taste, so this is a nice refreshing beverage. Refreshing at room temperature. True. And we've got Butterscotch chocolate. Let's give it a go. Hahaha, that's upside down but that's okay. Let's try a piece of this. Mmmmmm. Oh wow! Oh yeah, you really taste the butterscotch. It's creamy and sweet and delicious. Is this milk chocolate or is it dark bitter chocolate? No, it's really sweet. You'll love it. It kind of reminds me of Dulce de Leche. Dulce de Leche chocolate huh? Like it then? Yeah. I do like it. I mean normally organic chocolate isn't that great in my opinion because it's a little bitter. A bit too natural for me. But this is quite nice. She takes another bite. Nice and sweet. It's creamy. Shortbread cookies. This is Christmas in a tin. Mmmm, smells like Christmas? Oooooh, those look good. I can tell I'm going to like this. Nice big thick cookies. Crispy? Not crispy. Just crunchy Christmas cookies, you know? Mmmmmm. Going to share those? Maybe. You know this would make a really souvenir people. If you're visiting Scotland get Scottish shortbread. Those are real good. It reminds me of my Mom's shortbread cookies. She used to make for me for Christmas and I would eat a lot of those. And last but not least we have tablet, which is a sweet treat that everyone has been talking about. And this is what I'm most looking forward to having. This is supposed to be very much like fudge and so I can't wait to try it. This one is whisky flavored. Mmmmm....mmmm. Oh yeah! So I'm just going to go at this like it's a chocolate bar. Just bite right in. Smells good. Oh, wow. That is really really really sweet. Is it soft, crunchy, gooey, chewy? It's a little. I wouldn't call it crunch. It kind of crumbles in your mouth and yeah I can taste a hint of the whisky. I mean it's not overpowering. It's more sweet than anything else but there is definitely a hint of whisky. It smells like cheese. Take a bite. That's the smallest nibble ever. Okay, it's sweet when you taste it but it smells like cheese. I'm not kidding. Is that the whisky smell? Could be yeah. Do you like the taste though? Yes. Even though I'm just nibbling at it. I'm like grazing it with my teeth. It does taste nice. Very sweet. The smell? Mmmmm-ooooh. The smell doesn't do it for you? It gets a nay from me. Okay, so favorites. What was the best thing you ate? I really liked the tablet and the ginger beer the most. Why? Well, I just love to eat fudge and I like to drink beer - especially anything with ginger in it. Gingery beers....mmmmm. Okay, so my favorite I would say was the shortbread cookies. Those were really nice. It reminds me of Christmas and least favorite I'd have to say the tablet just because it smelled really bad. I'm sure regular tablet is great but the Whisky flavored one I'm telling you it smells like cheese. Like go buy a pack and sniff that and come back to me. And I think the thing we both didn't like was the Irn Bru. Yeah, it's a bit too sweet but not terrible. I didn't like it at all. That was my least favorite by far. Anyways, so yeah when you come to Scotland try out these products and try out other things and let us know what you think. And if you have any suggestions of things that we should try while we're here in Edinburgh just leave it in the comments below. I think tomorrow we're going to be hunting for some deep-fried pizza. Number one goal. Yeah, we just had the deep-fried chocolate bars today so. Okay, tootles. Bye. Arrrrggghhhhh! Hahaha So this morning we are at the Loony Dook and it's a bit of tradition here in Scotland that the day of New Years people jump into the freezing waters of the Firth of Forth and it's all to raise money for charity, so we're going to watch them do that. Are you going to do it? No way! Cheering. More cheering. Hahahaha! Yeeaaaah! Yeeeeeaaaah! So there is a man wrapped up in bubble wrap that nearly floated away. The rescue team picked him up in the water. So that was one of the coolest, craziest and I must say zaniest events I've ever seen. I'm glad that I was behind the lens and didn't go into the water. Everyone looks freezing cold right now.",False,"20141203 - Things to do in Scotland Travel Guide, Top Attractions & Scottish Cuisine.en.srt"

This is the cultural hub of Laos and we're going to show you a few of the things you can do around town. When you're visiting Luang Prabang, it is really easy to stick to the city center. There is so much to do and see there but if you have the time come outside and explore the outskirts of the city. Come and check out the more rural sections. Right now we're going across a bamboo bridge and we're going to see what is on the other side. Lead the way. Because this is a very small city it is really easy to find yourself in the countryside. That's exactly what we've been doing just wandering down rural areas and we even found a dog to join us for the walk. Now we are up bright and early for a biking tour around the city. We picked up these bikes for 20,000 Kip, which is $2.50 USD and we have them for the day, so we're going to be cycling around. Let's see what we find. When comparing Luang Prabang to other cities in Southeast Asia there are some major advantages. One of them being that there is hardly any traffic here. It's a wonderful opportunity to take out your bicycle and just explore. You can go down the main roads, you can go down the side streets and you're not going to have to deal with cars and other bicycles or even pedestrians. Luang Prabang is very pedestrian friendly. In fact, there are so many different little back-alleys and lanes to explore that it is just a great idea to wander about without any sense of direction. There are some fantastic views in this city so one of our recommendations is to enjoy a meal by the river, which is what we're doing tonight. Another thing you'll want to do when you're in Luang Prabang is to visit all of the temples around the city. This morning we're visiting Wat Xieng Thong and it is one of the main temples in Luang Prabang. It is also known as the Golden City Temple and it really has some impressive glass mosaics. You'll want to wander around and take some photos. It is 20,000 Kip to enter which is $2.50 USD and like most places it is good to come early because it starts to get busy during the middle of the day. Now it is time for us to get a little bit of exercise. We're going to climb up 328 steps up Mount Phou si which is more like a hill for the best views of Luang Prabang. Admission to reach the top of this mountain is 20,000 Kip which is again is $2.50 USD. It is kind of cool going up because you go up one way and then you come down the other side of the mountain so you get to see different views along the way. How could we have a list of things to do in a city without focusing on the local cuisine. We're here at our favorite restaurant Tamarind. We've been here so often it's literally our home away from home and we're going to show you a few of our favorite dishes. This is the dipping platter. This over here is a coriander pickle. Next we have an eggplant dip. A tomato dip. We have paste made from buffalo skin. We have some seaweed chips and then some vegetables that we can use with the sauce. Let's dig in. That all goes together, of course, with our sticky rice. Sam is going to demonstrate. This is how you eat. You just kind of put together a little ball like that and then you can pick a different dip. I'll try the buffalo sauce here. You put it together just like that and you pop it in your mouth. Delicious! This is the second plate we've ordered. Again, here we have a vegetable pickle. This is a pork salad that also has banana flowers. We have a pork sausage and here is some buffalo jerky - Sam's favorite. Oh yeah! Over here we have some little lettuce rolls that are stuffed with different dips and different sauces. We'll be trying those. We've ordered so much food we almost forgot about this next dish. It is time for me to do the honors. I'm going to unveil our steamed fish, which comes wrapped in banana leaf. It is called Mok Pa. Let's see what is in here. It is like opening a present. I know. It is like Christmas on a plate. Oh, wow! There it is. You can see the steam coming off of it. That is going to be good. And when the sun goes down it is time to go shopping. We're at the tourist night market and we're picking up souvenirs. If there is one thing that Luang Prabang is known for is for its Almsgiving which happens every morning at six AM. This is where monks collect alms of rice from kneeling locals and tourists. Tips on how not to be a total wanker at the ceremony. First, don't use your flash and don't blind the monks. Secondly, don't chase them down. You see people doing both of these things and it is infuriating. If you love to eat like we do then you can't leave Luang Prabang without taking a cooking class. Today we're at the Phou si market and we're picking up ingredients before we start preparing our food. Not much sugar in Lao cooking like in Thai food. When you taste Thai food you taste milky and creamy and sweet things because they add lots of coconut milk and lots of sugar. That is why their food tastes like that. Laos food is different. Lao food tastes lots of herbs and lots of texture. This is Lao food. I'd like to point out that Sam and I are making the exact same dish. This is his sauce and this is mine. What are you missing? Just about everything. Here we have our buffalo salad. We stir friend some buffalo meat and we also added beansprouts and there is banana flowers. We have string beans, hot chilies and mint leaves. We're going to be rolling this up in lettuce leaves. It is kind of like a little fresh roll. Today we're visiting Vientiane - the capital of Laos - and unlike other cities in Southeast Asia, which are the capitals of other big nations like Bangkok in Thailand, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia or Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam this is a very small and quaint capital city. This city gets a little bit of a bum rap, which I don't think is entirely justified. There are not a lot of attractions here per say but it is the kind of place where you can come and just out and relax. There is really good food and it is cheap. It is a good hub to get to different places in the country. You can get to Luang Prabang in the north or you can head south to Savannakhet or 4000 islands. This afternoon we wanted to visit Wat Si Saket but unfortunately we left it a bit too late. The temple has already closed, so we can't actually go inside but we're going to give you a little tour of the surroundings. Get here before four PM people! This is the place I was most excited to visit. We made it to the Triumphal Arch and we are going to be climbing all the way up. It is only a couple stories high. Why the sad face? We seem to be a roll here because we just got here and apparently it is closed. It closed at four o'clock just like the temple closed at four o'clock and we missed it because we wanted to eat Indian food. We put Indian food before sightseeing. Well, actually you did. Oh, be quiet! We had three major things planned. So far two of those have become absolute failures. Let's see if we can make it to the Mekong river before we miss sunset. Normally when we travel to a destination we like to spend six to seven days basically close to a week because we do have online work and jobs. But Vientiane was unfortunately just a stopover so we only really had one day to go out and explore. This is a bit of an unusual capital in the sense that it is very small and it doesn't necessarily offer a lot of attractions for visitors. However, I really enjoyed being able to spend a few days here and just relax and enjoy the surroundings because it has a very peaceful feel. The journey to Laos is actually a three day trip. Day one involves driving from Chiang Mai to Chiang Khong, which is at the border between Laos and Thailand. On day two we finally get on the boat and travel from Chiang Khong across the border and arrive at Pak Beng. The last day (the third day) is nine hours on a boat all the way from Pak Beng to Luang Prabang. We're going to tell you all about our journey - the pros, the cons, the things that were great and what wasn't so great. First, this is the actual trip. Overall conclusions about this trip - we'd definitely recommend taking the slow boat from Thailand to Laos; however, doing the three day tour is definitely something we'd reconsider. Perhaps a lot of our negatives come from the fact that we did a budget tour and we took the option that is only 2400 Baht. Some of the things we didn't like so much is that we were always leaving behind schedule and sometimes we'd be waiting around for an hour before anything happened. Also, when it came to accommodations the hotels weren't amazing. Our first night was spent at a former jail and it kind of felt a bit spartan. There was no hot water so we couldn't shower. In terms of food, I would call it prison food. It was boiled cabbage and just overcooked rice. Those were some of the cons. I think you're being a little bit too kind with your description of the hotel. That was literally the hardest bed I've ever slept on. I would have been more comfortable on a rock. If I had to do this trip over again I would definitely do it independently. You can take a bus from Chiang Mai (or other Northern Thai cities) all the way to the border. You can cross it yourself and find your own accommodations. You can find something that is a little bit better and more suitable than what we stayed at. Also, you can buy your own boat tickets as well and by showing up early at the pier and purchasing it yourself ensures you get a good seat. That is the key to enjoying your experience going down the Mekong. A few tips to make the trip a bit more pleasant would be to show up early. You want to be the first person on the boat so you can choose the best seats. You don't want to be near the front because the views aren't that great and you're kind of sitting sideways. You don't want to be near the back because the engine is rambling and it is incredibly loud. You want to choose a seat in the middle. Also, you'll want to bring a cushion or a pillow just in case you end up sitting on the wooden seats. Those are not very comfortable and you'll also want to stock up on lots of food and bring sandwiches, pastries and whatever it is you'll want to eat because it is a long trip and on the boat they just have chips and tea and cups of noodles. For lunch today we are eating at one of our favorite restaurants in Luang Prabang - it's called Tamarind. It focuses on Lao food, so we're going to be showing you some traditional dishes. This over here is called Nam Kham and it is a Tamarind cooler and you get a nice little bamboo straw and it is a really sweet and sour drink. It is refreshing but a little tart. I really like it. It's so good! Next up we have our dipping platter. This over here is coriander pickle, next we have an eggplant dip and tomato dip. We have a paste made from buffalo skin, we have some seaweed chips and then some vegetables that we can eat with the sauce. Let's dig in. That all goes together of course with our sticky rice. Sam is going to demonstrate for us. This is how you eat it. You just kind of put together a little ball like that and then you can pick a different dip. I'll try the buffalo sauce here. You put it together just like that and you pop it in your mouth. Delicious! Is it a bit spicy? Oh yeah! This one is really spicy. Finger food! Finger food! That is a huge ball. Little ball. That is not little. Okay, I will go with the aubergine. She has got her happy face on. It is so good. It is not just aubergine. They've added spices - there is coriander, onions - there is just an explosion of flavors. This is the second plate we've ordered. Again, here we have a vegetable pickle, this is a pork salad that also has banana flowers, we have a pork sausage and here is some buffalo jerky - Sam's favorite. Oh, yeah! Over here we have some little lettuce rolls that are stuffed with different dips, different sauces, so we'll be trying those. Buffalo jerky time! I've broken off a little piece of this buffalo jerky and this is my favorite. Chewy, right? Yeah, it is very chewy like any kind of jerky but this is probably the sweetest jerky I've ever had. I can't remember ever tasting anything quite this sweet in jerky form. You have this lettuce leafy roll over here. I taste lemongrass and something sweet like a yam almost but I'm really not sure what it is. It could be some local thing. We've ordered so much food we almost forgot about this next dish. It is time for me to do the honors. I'm going to unveil our steamed fish, which comes wrapped in a banana leaf. It is called Mok Pa. Let's see what is in here. It's like opening a present. I know, it's like Christmas on a plate. Oh, Wow! There it is. You can see the steam coming off of it. It is going to be good. It comes with a side of vegetables, so let's not forget about those. Time for a taste test. First bite! Wow! This is cooked in a dill and basil sauce. It just melts in your mouth. It is so soft and so flavorful. It is delicious! Now for dessert we are having something that is called Khao Gam. It is purple sticky rice that has been cooked in coconut milk and it also has banana and sesame seeds on top. Down here! It looks amazing! If that weren't enough, we get a little shot of Tamarind sauce which we can pour over top. I'm going to try it the natural way without the tamarind sauce first. It is so fragrant. Nice and sweet? Very sweet. You can definitely taste the coconut and it is a nice sticky rice with a bit of a nutty texture. I like it. Let's try this with some tamarind sauce and a big chunk of banana. Oh my, it is so good. The tamarind gives it a kick and a bit of spice. It is still really sweet. That splendid feast came to just over $18 USD, 151,000 Kip which we think was excellent value. It is a bit of a gourmet type of restaurant. It is right by the river. You've got awesome views from here. Here we are visiting a market again and that can only mean one thing - we are taking a cooking course yet again. Today we are going to be learning how to make Lao food and our first stop is Phou Si market. It is the biggest market in Luang Prabang and apparently it opens up at four in the morning. For our cooking class today it's an awesome surprise - we've got this lush garden setting. It feels like we're just walking into someones backyard. In Laos his wife and daughter cook for the family not the husband and son. This is culture. We don't put much sugar in Lao cooking like Thai food. You taste Thai food and it tastes milky and creamy and sweet because they add lots of coconut milk and lots of sugar. That is why the food tastes like that. Lao food is very different tasting like lots of herbs and lots of texture. This is Laos food. This does not mean Thai food is not tasty. Thai food is very tasty but our food tastes different. I'm pounding peppers, onions and that is it. Now time to try your tomato dip. I made mine really spicy accidentally because I thought we were cooking this. I'm making a little ball with the sticky rice. Voila! I'll dip it in here. How is it? It has a real kick to it but it is so good. It has lemon juice, hot peppers, garlic. I like it. I'd like to point out that Sam and I are making the exact same dish. This is his sauce. This is mine. What are you missing? Just about everything. We're making the Mok Pa fish and you are going to show us how to wrap it. What a work of art Audrey. Amazing! Oh, be quiet. It is going to taste amazing. We're cooking our buffalo meat right now. Here we have our buffalo salad. We stir-fried some buffalo meat and we also added bean sprouts,banana flowers, string beans, hot chilies and mint leaves. We're going to be rolling this up in lettuce leaves. It's kind of like a little fresh roll.",False,"20141201 - Things to do in Laos Travel Guide, Top Attractions and Lao Cuisine.en.srt"

In our Finland travel guide we present to you our entire collection of travel videos from Finland in this mammoth compilation. You can watch the entire video, coming in at nearly two hours long, or skip to a section of interest indicated by time links in the description box below. From sampling Finnish cuisine, including Salmiakki, reindeer, Karl Fazer chocolate and Karelian pie, we showcase Finnish food as much as our time spent traveling around the country kayaking, biking, horseback riding and hiking. We hope this video gives you a solid overview of the things you can do in Finland as well as all of the tasty Finnish cuisine worth sampling. This is Finland! Welcome to Helsinki! This week we're in the Finnish capital and we are going to be showing you some of the top attractions you should check out in the summertime. With its long days and short nights, summertime is a great time to be in Helsinki. This was our second visit to the Finnish capital, and we were excited as ever to experience it for a couple of days. With summer in full swing, we enjoyed dinners al fresco, boat trips to nearby islands, and lots of walking around town. Here's a look at how we spent our time in Helsinki: One of our favorite things about being in Helsinki were all the street performances taking place. Esplanade Park hosted several concerts, which were free to the public. Right now we're going to be visiting one of the most famous landmarks in all of Helsinki. This is Helsinki Cathedral and what is really cool about this church is that it is very different from other churches across Europe. Most European churches are very elaborate. They have a lot of paintings inside; however, once we go inside this church you are going to see that it is very simple, very white, very clean and it is just looks like a blank canvas. Helsinki Cathedral overlooks Senate Square, so after you visit the church, you can sit down on the steps and watch people go by. This is a very exciting moment for me here in Helsinki. I'm an enormous Salmiakki fan, which is black salty licorice. It is extremely salty and this particular kiosk here is famous because it sells over 91 different varieties of Salmiakki products. Okay, so what did you order from the kiosk? I've got my favorite kind of Salmiakki product - Salmiakki ice cream. It is like the best of both worlds. It is very salty, it has a very strong licorice taste and it is of course ice cream. Who doesn't like ice cream? And the coolest part here is that it is actually shaped like a Salmiakki candy. It has that exact shape. Mmmm. That is so good. What we're about to show you is called dinner in the sky. And you're going to see some people sitting up on a table just hanging from a crane. Look for yourself. Market square is a great place to pick up fresh vegetables and berries, and you can also try a number of traditional Finnish dishes ranging from grilled salmon to reindeer meatballs. We frequented the market almost daily, and at 10 Euros a meal, we thought it was a budget-friendly option for travelers. So it is now time for lunch and we've stopped off at Market Square - one of my favorite places to grab a really tasty and cheap meal. Today we are having grilled salmon, potatoes and vegetables. And yeah, let's go enjoy this before it gets too cold. Alright, hungry boy. Ready for the first bite? It is time for some salmon. I never get tired of eating salmon. If I lived here I'd probably be eating this daily. So now that we're finished eating we're going to show you the more crafty side of Market Square. This is a great place to pickup some traditional Finnish products and souvenirs to take back home. Helsinki has a thriving design district and I really enjoyed visiting various shops which showcased the best of Scandinavian design. My favourite was, of course, Marimekko which is renowned for its bold patterns and bright colours. Right now I'm in the Marimekko store, which is one of the most famous design stores in all of Finland. Finland has a unique tradition where people come and wash their carpets on floating docks by the sea. The carpets are then left to dry overnight without fear of anyone stealing them. After washing your carpets it is a great area where you can just go and grab a drink and relax. Up next we're visiting the Kamppi Chapel of silence. This chapel is located in one of the busiest areas of Helsinki and it is supposed to be a place where anyone can drop by and just enjoy a moment of silence. No services are held in this church but they do have clergy and social workers on hand if anyone needs to speak with them. Me. Traveller. So Sam, do you think one day you'll be able to grow an impressive beard like Santa's? Never. It looks like peachy fuzz. That I glued onto my face. Helsinki has a number of unique landmarks and attractions. One of them being this church carved out of a rock. And what is really cool about it is that this church has amazing acoustics so it is actually a very popular concert hall. The roof consists of a copper dome surrounded by a skylight, which allows natural light to stream into the building. During one of our afternoons in Helsinki, we hopped aboard the Helsinki Sightseeing cruise. The trip was an hour and a half in length, and we got to see the various islands that make up the city's archipelago. It was a beautiful sunny day with blue skies, and we saw a lot of sailboats out on the water. It is a beautiful day to be outdoors today and we are all geared up to go on a bike ride. We are going to be taking a tour of Helsinki. How is it going so far? I'm getting a workout here. You look really silly with your ball cap and a helmet on. Come on, I'm starting a new fashion trend over here. This is what is considered cool these days. Oh, really? No, definitely not. But what is cool is that just getting outside of Helsinki, a few kilometers, and you're out right in the woods. This is amazing. Let's do a 360. So we just finished our four hour long bike ride around Helsinki and next up we are going kayaking. Right now it is nine PM and it is still bright out and I think we're supposed to be back at midnight. So let's go. Normally, I like to do a single kayak because I don't really trust Sam on the water but I've been talked into this double kayak for newlywed couples. Teamwork. Teamwork. Except, I'm the only one paddling because you're sitting back there filming. Yep, that's about right. Enjoy a few beers in the back of the double kayak. Yeah, I'll just have the beers, sit back and let her do all of the work. Right, Audrey? Oh, hush you. Paddle. Paddle faster. Argh. No, don't make it wobble. I'm going to tip it over. Wobble. Wobble. Wobble. Wobble. Sam, that is not. Sam. Okay, stop it. It is eleven thirty now and we are paddling back home in the dark. With nothing but the moon and our lights to guide us. This is a city that comes alive during the summer months, and it was great enjoying all the events taking place in the city as well as relaxing outdoors. We loved revisiting Helsinki and we discovered so many new places that we had completely skipped over the first time around. Have you been to Helsinki? Let us know about your experiences in the comments below. For more travel and food videos hit subscribe. Surprise, surprise, surprise! We are back in Finland almost one year to the day that we left. This is awesome. This is one of my favorite countries in all of Europe. Most people when they arrive sometimes they go and freshen up. They might splash a little water on their faces or maybe go to the washroom after a long nine hour flight. But no. What is the first thing that I do - get my Salmiakki candy. I've been craving this for over a year and I've already ate half of the bag and I'm having even more now. So good! What we're about to show you is called dinner in the sky. You are going to see some people sitting up on a table, just hanging from a crane. Look for yourself! The port area or market square appears to be even bigger and busier than last time year. It is just bustling with activity and there is a Ferris Wheel right over there. A bit hot and tired are we? Oh my gosh, so sweaty and tired. I need a shower and a bed. And you know what - this is easily the hottest day we've ever experienced in Finland. Yes. It is over thirty. We're back in jail. We stayed here last year. We did. Let's check out the room. Come on in. This room here used to be a jail cell which explains why the windows are so high up, so the prisoners couldn't escape. Also, they have really thick curtains here in Finland and that is because during the summer the sun just stays up a really long time. You wouldn't be able to sleep otherwise. We're back in Finland on an eight day adventure and we plan on shooting a daily vlog. Basically what we want to do is just show you exactly what we're doing and what it is like to be in Finland in the summer - both in the city and outside in the countryside doing more adventure types of activities. We just arrived at Lonna Island. This used to be a former military island and it has just opened to the public this summer, so we're going to check it out. It was a really cool meal. We had grilled fish and potatoes. And that is just like the quintessential Finnish summer meal. It's our first full day in Finland and it is finally breakfast time. We actually woke up at two thirty in the morning because we were jet lagged and then the sun slowly started coming up at like four thirty in the morning. We've been waiting for this for a long time. Someone is hungry. Yes. That was a really filling breakfast. I think we're both just stuffed. We're going to go on a very small walk around jail hotel and show you the sites. They have a really cool little garden where it appears they're growing their own vegetables. It is a beautiful day to be outdoors today and we are all geared up to go on a bike ride. We are going to be taking a tour of Helsinki. How is it going so far? Oh, I'm getting a workout here. You look really silly with your ball cap and helmet on top. Come on, I'm starting a new fashion trend over here. This is what is considered cool these days. Oh really? No, definitely not. But what is cool is that just getting outside of Helsinki, a few kilometers, you're out right in the woods. This is amazing. Let's do a 360. We just finished our four hour long bike ride around Helsinki and next up we're going kayaking. Right now it is nine PM. It is still bright out and I think we're supposed to be back at midnight, so let's go. Normally I like to do a single kayak because I don't really trust Sam on the water but I've been talked into this double kayak for newlywed couples. Teamwork. Except, I'm the only one paddling because you're sitting back there filming. Yep, that's about right. Enjoy a few beers in the back of the double kayak. Yep, I'll just have the beers, sit back and let her do all of the work. Right, Audrey? Oh, hush. Paddle. Paddle faster. Argh. No, don't make it wobble. I'm going to tip it over. Wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble. Sam! That is not. Okay, stop it. It is eleven thirty now and we are paddling back home in the dark with nothing but the moon and our lights to guide us. It is day three in Finland and today we are going for a walk in the woods. We're here at Nuuksio National Park. On today's outing we learned about Every Man's Right in Finland. This is a traditional Finnish concept that allows people to camp out freely, to pick berries and mushrooms in the wild, to fish with a rod and line, and to walk, cycle, or ski anywhere on the land. To sum it up, Every Man's Right means that everyone is free to enjoy the land. Where are you right now? Right now I'm in a woodshed and what is really cool is that the Finnish government provides wood for all of the National Parks. You can go out and make a fire here. Har! Har! Except, you don't have any firewood. After hiking for a while, we cooked some sausages and enjoyed some sandwiches by the lake. It was a great way to spend a summer afternoon in Finland. And we're kayaking again today. It is eight o'clock right now. It is calm. It is peaceful outside. It is still very light and we have the golden rays of the sun shining down on the water. Today is day four of our Finnish adventure and we are going to be going horseback riding. Now let's go meet our Icelandic horses. What makes Icelandic horses different is that they have very gentle characters. Also, while they may be smaller in stature, they are actually very strong horses. We're making our first stop of the morning. We're visiting a local flea market. In here it is a mix of antiques, dishware and clothes. That was a lot of fun. My horse, Farri, turned out to be a really hungry boy. He just kept stopping for grass and for flowers along the way but we got to see the countryside and I really enjoyed it. A cool fact that we've learned while in Finland is that there is thirteen thousand trees for every Finn. That is a lot of trees. Finland's archipelago is made up of thousands of little islands, so one of the best ways to get around is by boat. Our guide took us out to visit a former military island which is now home to little summer cottages. We had a cute German pointer join us, keeping us entertained. We are now on an island called Bolax and this used to be a former military island. Now we have a special guide with us and he is going to take us inside an old canon. Let's go climb in. Along the way we got to see sailboat races and a nesting ospreys. Okay, Sam what are you having today? Salmiakki! Salmiakki! I'm going to down it. One shot. One shot. Oh, that is awesome. What does it taste like Sam? Just like Salmiakki. Sam-iakki. This is shot number three. This is shot number three and it is going down in one blast. Watch this. Oh, so yummy. Is there a forth one? That is amazing. That is so good. There you go. Are you serious? Is it better than the sweets? Why not? Sam, is it better than the sweets? My liver just flipped. Another bottle for Sam? I've got to go to the washroom. Day five in Finland. This morning we're taking a speed boat from Kasnas to Hanko. Ready for some adventure guys? Yeah! Yes! Finland's archipelago region, which is part of the Baltic Sea, is home to thousands of small islands. The rib boat was a fun way to experience the natural scenery of this area. Plus it got us to the port town of Hanko in record time. Woo! We just arrived here in Hanko and we've picked up our Sun Fun bikes and we're going to go on a little tour of the city. Hanko is a small town that sits on the shores of the Baltic Sea, and it also happens to be the southernmost point in all of Finland. This is a popular summer destination, where Finns rent villas by the sea. Everything about the town felt laid-back and relaxed. Our afternoon in Hanko was spent doing a little bit of hiking and plenty of biking past ponds, through forests, and along the beach. So you just made some new friends! Bah bah! I'm just hanging out with my new friends here the sheep. We're visiting a farm and I guess what we're going to be doing here is selecting some ingredients - some vegetables and different things - and we're going to be cooking our own meal tonight. Oh, yes! So neither of us realized this is actually an electric fence and we both just got zapped. That's an electric fence. We just finished our bike ride where we got to visit a few local farms and now we're going to be cooking a meal with all of those local ingredients. Let's go to the kitchen. Peeling time. I'm in charge of potatoes. Don't eat all of my whip cream. I said one bite because you want to be in the video. Mmmm, one more. One more. That's so mean. Alright, so this is day six in Finland and this morning we are going to try stand up paddle boarding. Apparently, this is a sport that has been around since the 60's but it has only become really popular in the last three years. I've never done this before so I hope my balance is really good. And if there is one person that is most likely to fall in it is definitely me. I would agree. Fingers crossed. Our guide attempted teaching us to paddle both the Hawaiian and the Tahitian way, but most of us were concerned about not falling in to the waters of the chilly Baltic Sea. Okay, Mr. Wobble Wobble are you ready? I bet I'm going to be the only one who actually falls in. Like a cat on the water. Worse than a cat on the water. Okay, Sam is going to attempt standing up. Let's see how this goes. Oh, it looks like he's got it. Our first time stand up paddle boarding turned out to be a lot of fun, and we were lucky to have calm waters to practice. Audrey was a natural. I on the other hand, had a little trouble dismounting. Hahaha! Oh my gosh. Did you get it on film? That is not the best way. Dock fail. When in Finland you absolutely have to experience a sauna. Apparently, there are five million Finns and three million saunas. We're going to go in and try one. I absolutely love the sauna. When I lived in Korea I used to go almost weekly, so this is going to be a lot of fun. Okay, let's go in. Finnish sauna is typically enjoyed naked with friends and family, but we kept it PG13 for you guys. You're welcome! We're here in Finland today and we're going to be trying Salmiakki. Now for those of you who are not very familiar with this it is a salty black licorice. We actually got to try it last year when we visited and I hated it but Sam loved it. I think our reactions are going to be a bit predictable. Now today we have six different kinds of Salmiakki so let's get started. The special ingredient of Salmiakki is ammonium chloride and that is what gives it its salty and very overpowering taste. Oh boy, this is a real treat. This is a Salmiakki ice cream and we decided well we better eat this first before it actually melts. Let's open it up and it is from Fazer. From Fazer brand which is a really popular brand in Finland especially for chocolate but it is also really popular for Salmiakki as well. Okay. That is hilarious. What is funny about this is that it is basically shaped like a Salmiakki candy would be. So it has got...yeah. It looks quite authentic here. Let's have the first bite. That is the best salmiakki I've ever had. In ice cream form it is a lot sweeter and it still has got all of that overpowering salmiakki taste. I just love this. I'm going to eat the whole thing. I guess now it is my turn. I'm kind of hoping the middle is vanilla flavored. Yummy yummy? Urgh. No. Um. It is not as bad as the candies I've had before but it still has a really strong Salmiakki taste and I mean the ice cream is actually a bit salty which I don't think should be the case with ice cream. I'm giving it the thumbs down unfortunately. That one didn't last very long. Next up we've got Fazer Super Salmiakki and this of the candy variety. Let's open this one up. And already I can tell - I've tried other Salmiakki candies but this one feels a lot harder, so I have a feeling it is going to be a bit different. It is not going to be as chewy. Let's give this a shot. Okay, so you can definitely taste the Salmiakki here. It is very strong. As I expected, it is a hard candy and it is not very chewy. I think it is a really great type of Salmiakki product you take with you maybe when you're driving in a car or something. You can just pop one in your mouth and it will last quite a while. Just let is sit and roll around on your tongue. I guess it is my turn to give it a go. Oh, the excitement! How much longer do I have to taste it before? Put the whole thing in your mouth. It is like really salty. Saltier than the ice cream. It tastes like horrible medicine. There is nothing redeeming about it. Yeah. Spitting sounds. I'm actually not entirely sure what this Salmiakki product is. These look like maybe more kind of a sugary type of rolls. This should be interesting. Let's try these. I've never had them. Kind of neat. They've got a brown filing. Mmmm. Okay, yeah. These are chewy and really sweet and these are more like your type of traditional candy I guess. You really taste the sugar along with the Salmiakki. Which is strong but it is not nearly as strong as the harder candy. So I'm still recovering from the last one but since these are super sweet and covered in sugar, I figured I'd give it a go. A little nibble. I'm not sure what the middle part is. It is brown. Coffee maybe? No it isn't. No. Urgh! Have it! Hahaha! You can have it! Okay, so as not to torture Audrey, she can be exempt from these next two things that I'm going to try. I'm just going to make her try the chocolate. Next up we've got Salmiakki in a box and we're going to try a different brand here. I believe it is called Halva. Let's try that. Whoops. They just fell out. Okay. I can tell right now these are really hard. Hard salmiakki type things. Let's have a look at them. Can you see them there? See, that is what the ice cream cone was shaped like. Just like this. So I'm going to put them both in. Those are really hard and small. They are similar to the ones I got from the Fazer bag from the first one that I tried. But yeah, they are really strong and again like kind of just slowly dissolve in your mouth. You can just kind of chew on them or just let them roll around on your tongue. And they are long lasting, so. I think the best thing about them is that they come in this little package here, so you could just like walk around with them in your pant pocket and be like hey I feel like some Salmiakki and just whip it out and have a bite. Alright, next up we've got the mixed bag of Salmiakki and this is also from Fazer. As you can see from on the back of the package there is all of the different shapes and sizes. Let's open that up. There we go. You know what - I'm just going to dump a whole bunch of these on here so we can kind of see what they look like. And I'm going to just start trying one of each. This is a different one. This one is different. Okay, so I've got four in my mouth right now and yeah they really are different. Some of them are little bit larger and more chewy and then the other ones are hard and they are kind of similar to the ones that you can get like the pocket sized ones. They are hard and you kind of have to suck on them a bit longer but yeah this is for Salmiakki lovers. This has got it all. You've got all shapes and sizes here. And last but certainly not least we've got Salmiakki in chocolate form. And much like the ice cream I have very high expectations for this. I hope it is going to be sweet and chocolate-y and just overall delicious. Let's open this. Okay. From the outside, as you can see, it looks just sort of like your normal milk chocolate bar but let's break it off here and see if we can see if it is any different. Okay, it still looks normal to me. Mmmmmm. Oh, it is so good. Like it is just amazing. Like, chocolate is stellar. Salmiakki is stellar. Putting them together is just an awesome combination. This is just as good as like chocolate and peanut butter as far as I'm concerned. Okay, I'm going to show this part. And here you can see it is sort of like stuffed inside of the milk chocolate the same way a caramel milk chocolate might be like or if you had come to Canada or the US and you have like the peanut butter milk chocolate. How it is just kind of like in the middle and it is in a bit of a creamy form. Two thumbs up for this product. Alright, well, I do like the Karl Fazer chocolate bars. I have been eating them every single day since I've been back. I'm not so sure about the Salmiakki. I'll try a little corner. Hey, that is not right. The salmiakki is in the middle. You have to take a bite right in the middle. Come on. Last bite. It is like eating chocolate that has been stuffed with medicine and salt. I mean the chocolate is great and it kind of helps mask the Salmiakki taste but I'd rather have a plain chocolate bar. Alright, to sum of all of this up. I liked every single Salmiakki thing tried; however, there were things I liked more than others. My top two, were of course, the ice cream and the chocolate bar because I also have a sweet tooth and combining salmiakki with milk chocolate and ice cream. That is just amazing. Okay, next up I do really like these ones too. These like. These candies that are a bit more sweet than the other ones. So I rank those really highly. So among the more I guess traditional hard candies like these ones would be great to carry with you in your pocket. Although I do prefer the ones that are a little chewier so this is just more portable. And amongst these two I would have to say I'll go with the mixed bag. So everything is awesome. If you're in Finland you absolutely have to try this. It is the kind of polarizing thing. You're probably either going to love it or hate it. And most foreigners who - especially those who haven't tried liquorice before - are probably not going to like it. I love it this stuff, so if you don't finish your bag or your chocolate bar or your ice cream you know where to send it. We were hoping to do a Finnish chocolates and candy bar while we were in Finland but unfortunately we ran out of time. So we're now back at home in Canada and we're just sitting in my backyard and today we are going to be taste testing all of this candy. It should be a fun afternoon. And we've got Max, the dog, to join us. Max, do you want chocolate? Chocolates! He's like - where is the steak? Where is the sausage? First off we are starting with this little Jim bar. And we've never had this one before. No, let's see what it tastes like. It is very small. For a healthy snack. Mmmm. Oh, it is white inside. It has a very fruity flavor but I can't really make out what kinds of fruit are in here. Banana, perhaps? It is really nice. I like it. Okay, so I'm a huge fan of licorice and I've had a lot of Salmiakki since I've been in Finland but this is something I've never tried. This is called Lakupala and it is Tropico. Apparently, there is dark chocolate, orange, berries and possibly pineapple. So I have a feeling this is going to be sweet liquorice. I have no idea. I'm opening it up. You can see the different colors. So here is one that is white. Let's guess the flavors. Okay. So without looking at the bag, what do you think that one is? I think that is pineapple. And it is really sweet. This is definitely candy kind of licorice with a lot of sugar but I like it. Audrey hates licorice but maybe we can finally find something that she likes. Maybe this fruit flavored licorice will win her over. Okay, I'm purposely going to choose the red berries because I like berry flavored stuff, so maybe I'll be able to enjoy this. Did you spit it out? Uhhhh. And no more licorice for Audrey. That would just be cruel for me to force her to try more of it - especially the Salmiakki. Okay, so next up for me is the Tupla bar. Also, this is a bar we've never had as well. So I was reading up on this chocolate bar and apparently Tupla means double because you get two little bars inside of the package. This one looks like it got a little bit crushed. Okay, so it is milk chocolate and nuts on the exterior. And then I think the filling might be nougat. It is kind of chewy and very sugary. Yeah, I do like this one. It is really nice. Audrey was kind enough to share the second one with me so I'm going to try this for the first time. I wasn't kind enough to share - I think you stole it. A guy has got to do what a guy has got to do. You're right, this is a really chewy chocolate bar and very sweet. I do like it though. Mmmmm. Before we became travel bloggers and started making YouTube travel and food videos, we used to teach English in South Korea. And our students were obsessed with Angry Birds. Like they just loved that game. Angry birds originated from Finland and they have a little candy bar here. I think it might be licorice. Let's show us the Angry bird. It is a yellow Angry Bird. There they are. It looks quite angry doesn't it? Alright, let's try this Angry Bird candy. Indeed, it is licorice and it appears to be filled with something. Okay, yeah, it is a very sugary licorice that I'm sure kids would love. And yes it is pineapple flavored inside. Kids and Sam love it. Here I have Moomin gummy bears. So if you're not too familiar with Moomins, they're actually characters from a Finnish fairy tale and they kind of look like Hippos, right? I think it looks like a hippo, yeah. They're just big plump, white creatures and while we were in Helsinki they were celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of the creator of the Moomins, so Moomins were all over the city. These are gummy's. Let's see. Are they shaped like Moomin? Yeah, let's see. This one looks like a Moomin. And there is some people in there as well. I'm not sure what the story is with these guys but they must all be characters. I'll try this one. Mmmm. Maybe apple? Is it sweet? Yeah. These are really good. I think I'll be keeping these for myself since I don't like the licorice, I won't share these. No Finnish taste test video would be complete without testing Salmiakki. This is a treat that is absolutely adored in Finland but a lot of foreigners don't like it. It is extremely salty. It is made with Ammonium Chloride. It is like a black type of licorice except it is so much saltier than any kind of licorice I've ever had. I love it. Audrey really doesn't like it, so I'm not forcing her to have any. And I'm just going to show you what it looks like. Now, this is one kind of Salmiakki you can get. These are the smaller ones and they are kind of harder candies. So you just them in your mouth and you suck on them. Mmmmm. I'm in my happy place right now. So next up we have some Jenkki spearmint gum. So I actually have a few Finnish Canadian friends and whenever they come back from Finland this is what they bring back. I've actually had this several times before in Canada. Let's see. But I like it, so I'm happy to try it again for the video. Jenkki! Let's see what it looks like. It's gum. It tastes like your average gum. It's not a super overpowering flavor like some of the Excel gums but yeah this one is nice. Aside from Salmiakki, my next favorite Finnish food is Karl Fazer chocolate. And this is just amazing high quality chocolate. I think this one we have here is just the plan milk chocolate one. This is your standard Karl Fazer chocolate bar. And I recommend if you're going to eat this get the big bar. This is just the little tiny one. Those big massive 200 gram bars - those are the best. It is just so creamy and delicious and I like that sure it is sugary but it is not too sugary. That is a big difference between European and American chocolate is that there is more creaminess and richness to European chocolate whereas American chocolate is really sugary. So this stuff is way better. Here is a unique one. While we were in the supermarket looking for different chocolate bars we could try we came across Karl Fazer bar but as you can see over here this one is Chili and Crisps. So I've never had chocolate with chili before. We'll what that actually tastes like. I'm expecting to like it. I wonder if it is spicy or not? Yeah. It'll be interesting to see. I hope it is not too too spicy. Hopefully you won't spit it out like the licorice. I mean it must be a good combination for Karl Fazer to produce this. I'm still not tasting the chili. Are you biting into it? Um hmm. Maybe it is just very mildly flavored. I'm waiting for it to kick in. There is something crunchy in there for sure. Okay, actually when you swallow the chocolate there is a slight burn in your throat. I think there is a chili. I'm going to let you try it and see what you think. Alright, I'm going to have two pieces here to try and make sure we can find that chili inside. Yeah, you're right. It is not initially spicy. It does have that crunch though. I think you'll feel it when you swallow the chocolate. Tell me how that feels. Okay, a little bit of a burn but not much. I mean this is very tame. This is very tame. I'm very excited about the licorice all sorts. I grew up eating these in Canada, so I wonder if they taste the same or not. Alright, and so with the all sorts it really is just a whole bunch of different licorice candies. So I'm just going to hold them out in my hand as you can see here. These yellow ones tend to be sweeter. Let's see how this tastes. Mmm. Let's try one of each in the name of research. Yeah, that is very sweet. What is the yellow one flavored like? They are not actually flavored like the colors that they are. They're just kind of sweet. Alright, one more. Yeah, those are really good. I mean they're just as good as any of the ones I've tried in Canada and I can tell that these are ones are really fresh, so I like them a lot. The best way to describe the licorice all sorts. Some of them are more sugary, some of them have more of a licorice taste, some of them are more chewy, so you've just got to grab a whole bunch of them, taste them one by one and see which one you like the most. And I saved one of my favorites for last - this is the Geisha chocolate bar which is also produced by Karl Fazer. Let's try this. I wish Karl Fazer would make his way over to Canada. I know. We really need him over here. Mmmm. That is really nice. So yeah, this one is a milk chocolate and it has a creamy hazelnut filling. Perfection. It is my favorite one, so I'm always happy to eat a Geisha bar. So that concludes our Finnish taste test. Let us know if you've tried any Finnish chocolates, licorice, gummy bears or Salmiakki. We're curious to know. For more food and travel videos hit subscribe. While we've been exploring the archipelago region for the past week we've actually been staying in this town. It has two names - the Swedish name is Dalsbruk and then the Finnish name is Taalintehdas. Most of the residents in this small community are Swedish native speakers and they also speak Finnish fluently. Some of the oldest ruins in town and they were used during the coal industry. That is our abbreviated tour of Dalsbruk - a place many come to vacation in nice cottages to go fishing, to go sailing - it is a very scenic place. We're going to miss it. Alright, tonight we've got a special Finnish treat to share you. This here is called Salmiakki and it is black extremely salty licorice. So my sister Ashley has a been to Finland before and she specifically told me to stay away from this nasty candy. She says it is the worst tasting thing ever out there and that I will spit it out within seconds. So I'm not really looking forward to eating a piece of it but Sam here is quite adamant about it. So this Salmiakki here, this black licorice has sometimes been referred to foreigners as a kind of fear factor food that. The television show the Fear Factor where people are dared to eat something that seems disgusting and really strange. What gives this the salty taste is ammonia chloride and this is very popular in Nordic countries - especially in Finland. That doesn't sound edible. Alright, so here is a piece of the Salmiakki. The black licorice. And I have to say that I've grown up eating licorice in Canada and it is probably quite a bit sweeter than this one and I'm a big licorice fan, so I'm hopeful that I am going to like this even thought it apparently exceptionally salty. So here we go. Eating noises and chewing Woah! Yeah! There is an explosion of flavors going on and that is just...WoW! That is very salty but I like it. Here's another piece. MMMMM! I have a bar of milk chocolate handy over here because I know I'm probably going to need to wash away the flavor of this nasty looking thing. I'm just taking a small bite okay. Eating noises Yummy? Arrrrggggggh!!! Spitting noise! Hahahahaha Did you just spit it out? I don't like licorice. I've never liked licorice and that's just foul. Okay, where is your chocolate piece now? Better? Good, because that means I get more (of the Salmiakki). MMMMMMM Two more pieces in my mouth here. Eating noises...MMMM I'm glad you don't like it because that means I get to eat the whole bag. Today we are having lunch at a place called Strandhotellet here in Dalsbruk, Finland. We are going to be trying some local foods centered around salmon. I'm really excited about the pizza. I've never had salmon as a topping. For our appetizer we ordered some smoked salmon with dill on a nice piece of rye bread and we've also got a really tasty potato salad over here. A big bite. The salmon keeps getting better and better. That is probably the best bite of salmon I've had since I've been in Finland. Here is my wonderful thin crust pizza. Come have a look. It has lots of tomatoes, cheese and greens. I think a few things got lost in translation because we were under the impression that it was going to be a salmon pizza. This looks just as good. Let's dig in. How is that? You're going to like this a lot. So what really makes this pizza delicious for me is the cheese and the olive oil drizzled on top. That is so tasty. Okay, so up next we're trying the chocolate fondant, which has strawberries and cream. Try some strawberry too. Look at the inside. Nice and gooey. You can tell it has just been baked fresh out of the oven. It is so decadent and sweet. That was a really nice meal at a local cafe. The place was recommended to us by one of our local contacts and we really enjoyed the food. It came to 27 Euros and considering we got a entree, a main dish and dessert we think that is a pretty fair price for Europe. Yeah, we ended up sharing everything. Yeah, and we are stuffed. Live rock music. So we are trying three different Finnish beers. We have lager, red ale and I have forgotten the name of this one. Verdict? That's nice. A nice light beer. Okay, next red ale. I like the flavor of this one a little more. What does it taste like? It's just got more of a bite to it. This is a lighter beer for sure. And the last one? My favorite. Really? It's all about the flavor. Alright, your turn. I'm going to start off with the light one. Lager. It tastes like a light beer. I don't know much about beer. Red ale. It has a nice aroma to it and it is a bit stronger than the other one. I agree. This I'm not so sure I will like it just based on the color. It looks really strong. Okay, what is your favorite of the three? I'm going to go with the light girly beer. Surprise, surprise. Rock music playing live. Background music playing. We're going to be eating Rudolph the Reindeer today! I'm a little sad about it but I'm in Finland so I have to try reindeer. Reindeer? Is it tasty or what? It really is. It has a very rich taste. It's must different from the meatballs we had before the other day. This definitely has a real much stronger taste to it. Wow. if I had to compare it to something that tastes like a really strong seasoned roast beef. I'm going to think of it as salami. Okay, it tastes like salami. There we go. I'm eating Reindeer. It's a little sour. Right? Yeah. It's a little sour and salty. Okay. Do you like it? Yeah. It's growing on you? Well, not growing on me but it's okay. Live rock music playing. So Sam has been talking about the reindeer ever since we landed in Finland, so I'm glad he finally got to try it. It was a bit of a pricey appetizer I have to admit. It was sixteen Euro. A bit steep but it was a good experience. I'd say it was worth it. The reindeer cold cuts definitely had a distinct taste. Quite sour and it was certainly a lot better than meatballs we had tried the other day. Well, today we're off on a journey. We're going to be visiting a new country in Europe. Estonia! Tallinn. We're taking the MS Star from Helsinki all the way to there. It's only a two hour trip, so it should be a really comfortable ride. Background music playing. So in this area they have all the private cabins for people who are doing an overnight cruise. Background music playing. This is definitely one of the largest ferries I've ever been on. There is actually nine different levels as you can see from this map. Background music playing. Wow, the weather has really changed. Within just 10 minutes we went from clear sunny skies to foggy, windy weather. We're not even out there on the deck right anymore. Background music playing. So we're now pulling into the harbor here in Tallinn, Estonia and it is a chilly nineteen degrees. It doesn't feel like summer. background music playing. Background music playing. Okay, we are with Raakel my Finnish Canadian friend who is showing us around and we're going to an Island called Suomenlinna. Does that mean anything? It's like Finland. It's kind of like a castle. Background music playing. So we've arrived here finally and we honestly have no idea what we're going to be doing. There is no tourist information. We're just going to wander around. Looks like a village. A cute village. I think this looks like Anne of Green Gable in Finland. The cute little wooden houses, right? Background music playing. We've just witnessed a lovely Finnish wedding on an island. Background music playing. And what are we doing? Enjoying some ice cream. Perfect way to cool down after a little walk around the island. What flavors do you have? Pistachio. And I have raspberry sherbet. And what is that in Finnish? Finnish answer. And I'm having the one unique to Finland. Black licorice ice cream and it is delicious. What is this called in Finnish? Speaking bad Finnish. Lemon and black licorice. Wow, this is really really good. I don't believe it. Background music playing. Tonight for dinner we've decided to have a simple Finnish meal - a do it yourself meal. We went to a Finnish grocery store and just loaded up on a whole bunch of different goodies. We're going to have a small little feast. I have really been enjoying eating lots of black rye bread with salmon and dill on top. I think it is the best meal ever. I personally like to alternate between a hummus spread and a cream cheese spread. Those are my two favorite spreads and salmon is my favorite fish. This is just an amazing little snack meal. I'm going to miss this so much when I go back to Thailand. When we were in Helsinki last week I tried a pear cider. Now that we were in a supermarket, I noticed the same brand but with a pomegranate, so that is what I'm drinking right now. It is so nice and fruity. I'm really thirsty. She's going to get drunk like a skunk. Hey. I've got some beer and I'm assuming it is Finnish beer. I don't really know. It could be Swedish or something else but I'm guessing it is Finnish because of the Nen. I've noticed a lot of Finnish words and especially last names end with that. Let's assume it is Finnish beer. That's good stuff. This is also really good. It is like a potato salad. We're too lazy to get our own plates, so we're just eating right from the container. Having a do it yourself Finnish picnic is a great way to save money while having a delicious meal. We're just having our meal here on the porch of the guesthouse that we're staying at here. It's got fantastic views. Check it out. Background music playing. Today we're in the little town of Kasnas and we are waiting to catch a ferry that is going to take us to a very remote island, which apparently is home to one of the largest lighthouses in the area. Background music playing. We are now visiting Rosala which is an island which is home to a Viking Center. So we enjoyed a really hearty Viking feast that was a thick soup with potatoes and white fish and we also had some black rye bread with butter and after that meal we've just been enjoying the island. There is lots of games and activities for kids. You can try archery. You can try walking on stilts. They have a maze. Rabbits that you can feed. So it's a nice place to spend a sunny day. Laughing. Background music playing. We've arrived at the lighthouse and it's just on a big rock out in the sea. So to get here we had to take a boat. We've been traveling for about forty five minutes and as we were approaching the island it started to get really choppy. The waves are pretty high. So yeah, we're out here in the middle of the ocean. There is no land. It is just a pile of rocks. I don't know what is worse. Air turbulence or choppy waters. Background music playing. So right now we're making our way up the two hundred and fifty two steps that we have to climb all the way up to get to the top of the lighthouse. And apparently there is a couple of ladders too. And here in the lighthouse they also have a very small chapel where people can get married. Background music playing. So this is our first official little video here in Helsinki and we're just about to have a simple picnic lunch. We got some smoked salmon. Oooh la lah! That looks tasty. We go ourselves a nice baguette sandwich to enjoy in the park. A lovely pasta salad with feta cheese and some fizzy drinks to go along. So we're just going to enjoy the view and savor our dinner. Mmmmmm! The smoked salmon is easily my favorite part of this little picnic. It's a wonderful cheap meal. We were able to get all of this food for just roughly 10 Euro. So instead of going out for dining tonight we just decided to hit up a local grocery store, pick out some things that look good and it's turned into a fantastic little feast here on the park bench. Hello bird! Music playing More music playing Our first impression of Finland. One of the things we've noticed the most is just how cool the temperature is. I'm loving it. I can walk outside and I'm not sweating profusely. This city is definitely a lot quieter than where we come from. We've been living in Thailand for a few months and we're used to tuk-tuk's, motorbikes, honking, swirving and everything just.....yeah and meanwhile you can hear sirens and motorbikes in the background. This totally disproves my point...hahaha Music playing We've also noticed there is a really big biking and fitness culture here. Everyone seems to be riding around on their bikes, in-line skating and in this kind of weather who can blame them. Music playing So this is a bit of a cool supermarket we found right here. If you are too busy to go get your groceries all you need is your little smart phone. You can the bar codes for milk, for meatballs, ravioli, whatever, and they just deliver it to your place just like that. Wow! Music playing So we just across a bridge with love locks and that kind of reminded me of our love lock video that we made back in Korea. So it is eight forty five PM right now but as you can see it is still daylight out and that's because we are in the land of the midnight sun. So that's just a quick little intro into Helsinki we're both really tired so we're going to go get caught up some sleep and we'll make some more videos this week. Background music playing. When we were looking for unique places to stay in Helsinki we ended up stumbling upon and article about a prison hotel in the city, so that is where we are today. We're going to give you a tour of the place. Background music playing. So we are staying in jail cell number 319. Background music playing. So this is the oldest hotel building in Finland. It was used as a prison right up until 2002. In 2007, it was converted into a hotel. So we're having breakfast right now in the basement. It has a bit of a dungeony feel and I love that we get tin cups. It really adds to the whole prison feel. It almost feels like I'm a prisoner here but with really good food. Background music playing. So my favorite part about breakfast are these pastries. They are called Karelian pies. Apparently they are filled with potatoes. They're supposed to look like brains. Taste like brains? Oh, yeah. And my favorite part of breakfast here is just this awesome combination of trail mix, fresh berries and thick yogurt. Wow! This is where the prisoners exercised and they would have just walked around the perimeter of the prison. Apparently, the male prisoners dug a tunnel from the men's common room to the women's jail cell. They did this not to escape but for social hour. So this little mushroom would have been where the security guard sat when the prisoners were out walking and he had to make sure that no one escaped. He also had a German Shepard to help him but this was his little shelter. Even in the winter when it was snowy. Sounds like torture doesn't it? Background music playing. So the hotel has a little outdoor cafe. A nice little terrace. It's called the Jailbird and here you can just sample some beers, enjoy some reindeer meat and other Finnish delicacies. And there is also live music almost every night. They do yeah. And who better than to go to jail than Audrey Bergner who is known for being a naughty girl. What??? Okay, so today we're going to go Sea Kayaking and we're visiting some of the islands around the Archipelago here in Kimito Island and I'm all suited up to go out in the water. Hahaha! You sure are. Hello, I'm Benjamin. I work as a Sea Kayak guide in the Archipelago sea. It's a natural park. We have a lot of people from abroad who are coming here knowing about the Archipelago sea and want to see what it is like here. And Sea kayaking is really a good way to experience the wilderness. Background music playing. Meh! haha! Bababha! Background music playing. So how is the kayaking going so far? It's going great. We're just taking a short little break and came across some sheep who are just grazing by the sea. I guess by the sea. And my legs fell asleep so I had to get out for a while. But other than that it is going awesome. No capsizing so far. No. Background music playing. Very graceful. Hahaha! I got the video. You're still alive? Hello, I arrived. Still dry. Background music playing. Soaked little puppy. I am. I managed to make it the entire sea kayaking journey without capsizing. At the very end I flipped the boat over when I was getting out. So this was an awesome experience. We went sea kayaking and we were just paddling through wilderness and these small little islands where we saw different kinds of wildlife. All kinds of different birds. It was just awesome and it was a real workout too. We did this for a few hours. I'm exhausted now but Ioved every minute of it. Okay, so I was told that usually one in ten people capsize the kayak. I survived the whole four hour journey. I am still dry so I think I did pretty good. We're going to give you a little tour of a Finnish supermarket and we'll see what strange food items we can find. So smoked salmon is very popular food over here. You eat it with Rye bread. That's something we had almost everyday. Background music playing. We're also buying some Salmiakki, which is black salty licorice. I detested the taste of it but Sam really like it and apparently so does his Dad, so this is for him. This is a present for my Dad. For George. Background music playing. So in Finland there are many different kinds of alcoholic beers and beverages to choose from that you even have licorice flavored Salmiakki beer. So chocolate is extremely popular in Finland and there is no brand more famous than Karl Fazer. Background music playing. Black rye bread is always a really popular. We've been eating this daily with butter and cheese and smoked salmon on top. Canada represent. We've got some Maple Syrup. And of course the lumberjack. So this is day two in Helsinki. It is chilly as ever and we are going to do some sightseeing maybe visit a few churches and markets. And if we can we want to have reindeer meat at some point in the day. Oh, you are eating Santa's Helper! I'm going to be taking a bite out of Rudolph. background music playing. We found a little dog park. Let's see how friendly these pups are. Ruff. Bark. Bark. Let's go. Background music playing. And here we are introducing Uspenski Cathedral. This is one of the best known churches in Helsinki and it is an Eastern Orthodox church. Background music playing. This particular vantage point on the walk is one of the most popular areas in the city for people to have picnics. While we were walking here yesterday we saw about four or five different groups over here just having their own little picnic and just watching the city as things go by. Background music playing. Hello. What am I? I didn't see her body. Music playing by street musicians. Background music playing. We are here in Harbor Market. It seems to be one of the bigger markets in Helsinki and what we've found to eat. We've found reindeer meatballs. So we're going to go try those right now. Reindeer meatballs here we go. Hi, could we please try the reindeer meatballs? Yes, sure. Those are big meatballs. I think those are potatoes. Would you like some vegetables as well? Oh, sure, yeah. How about garlic sauce? Um, sure, yeah, please. Background music playing. Oh no, I'm not ready but geez I don't have much of a choice. I'm filming. That seems like a big enough chunk, right? It is! And what are you having? Reindeer meatballs. First bite. Is it good? It tastes like a regular meatball. Okay. Yeah, it doesn't have a very strong reindeer flavor. It's more garlic-y from all of the sauce we put over top. And these have to be the biggest meatballs I have ever seen in my whole life. Okay. Let's see what you think of it. Yeah, they don't have as distinct of a flavor as I thought they may. But what I really like here is this garlic sauce that has been put over top. Background music playing. We're back here at the market. This time we've got a salmon dish. Same price. About 10 Euros. This is smothered in garlic sauce. I already know I'm going to like it. Oh, wow. that just melts in your mouth.",False,20141111 - Finland Travel Guide and Finnish Cuisine Tour.en.srt

We're hungry in Hong Kong and that can only mean one thing. We're going out for lunch and we're going to eat dim sum. So we're going to be eating at Tim Ho Wan it's a Michelin Star restaurant here in Mong Kok in Hong Kong and it's one of our favorite places. We've been here, I don't know, maybe five times in the span of week, so we're going to show you what you can get inside. Background music playing. So they have a pretty cool menu over here. Thankfully it's in English not just Chinese, so when you first sit down at the table you just check-off the food items you'd like to order, you specify a quantity and then they bring it to your table as it is ready. Background music playing. Tasty Pu-erh tea from Yunnan Province, it's a dark fermented tea. My oh my, all of the food is arriving at once and over here we have a special little package with sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf and this rice comes with beef and chicken. It's really tasty. One of our favorites. Steaming hot. Background music playing. This is going to be hot. Hahaha! Oh, it is hot. I need a second to tell you about it. So yeah, this sticky rice is really good. I think it's actually called glue rice on the menu and it just has a very sticky consistency as you can see. You can just pick it up with chopsticks and it's been cooked with meat and chicken, so it has a nice meaty flavor to it. Out of all the different kinds of dim sum I've ever tried this is probably one of the most filling by far. Background music playing. Well, we certainly polished that off except for the bone. So next up I'm trying the glutinous rice dumping filled with meat. It's been deep-fried. Ow, hot. Everything is hot. Mmmmm. Well, you can't see the inside right now but it does have meat. Let me prove it. You can see it there. Mmmm. Looks good. It's like a ball of sticky rice with meat inside. Background music playing. And when it comes to dim sum this is my all-time personal favorite the barbecue pork bun. But this is a special variety of it baked barbecue pork bun. So, bite time. Mmmmm. Show us the inside. Ooooh, look at that barbecue pork. Yum. It's just so sweet and flavorful. The inside. The barbecue pork bun. And the outside of the bun it's so delicately crispy. Well, we've got one more dish coming. It is called tonic and pedelar cake. How does that sound to you? MMMMnnnn. Let me correct you on that. It's called tonic, medlar and petal cake as in flower petals. So I'm not really sure what to expect maybe something that tastes like perfume. And it was from the dessert section. Background music playing. I really hope Iike it. It's cold. Like gelatin. Sweet like honey. Michelin star quality that even a cheapskate extraordinaire can afford. Lets see the total. So that is 77 Hong Kong dollars which is just under 10 US dollars. For lunch today we are eating at one of our favorite restaurants in Luang Prabang - it's called Tamarind. It focuses on Lao food, so we're going to be showing you some traditional dishes. This over here is called Nam Kham and it is a Tamarind cooler and you get a nice little bamboo straw and it is a really sweet and sour drink. It is refreshing but a little tart. I really like it. It's so good! Next up we have our dipping platter. This over here is coriander pickle, next we have an eggplant dip and tomato dip. We have a paste made from buffalo skin, we have some seaweed chips and then some vegetables that we can eat with the sauce. Let's dig in. That all goes together of course with our sticky rice. Sam is going to demonstrate for us. This is how you eat it. You just kind of put together a little ball like that and then you can pick a different dip. I'll try the buffalo sauce here. You put it together just like that and you pop it in your mouth. Delicious! Is it a bit spicy? Oh yeah! This one is really spicy. Finger food! Finger food! That is a huge ball. Little ball. That is not little. Okay, I will go with the aubergine. She has got her happy face on. It is so good. It is not just aubergine. They've added spices - there is coriander, onions - there is just an explosion of flavors. This is the second plate we've ordered. Again, here we have a vegetable pickle, this is a pork salad that also has banana flowers, we have a pork sausage and here is some buffalo jerky - Sam's favorite. Oh, yeah! Over here we have some little lettuce rolls that are stuffed with different dips, different sauces, so we'll be trying those. Buffalo jerky time! I've broken off a little piece of this buffalo jerky and this is my favorite. Chewy, right? Yeah, it is very chewy like any kind of jerky but this is probably the sweetest jerky I've ever had. I can't remember ever tasting anything quite this sweet in jerky form. You have this lettuce leafy roll over here. I taste lemongrass and something sweet like a yam almost but I'm really not sure what it is. It could be some local thing. We've ordered so much food we almost forgot about this next dish. It is time for me to do the honors. I'm going to unveil our steamed fish, which comes wrapped in a banana leaf. It is called Mok Pa. Let's see what is in here. It's like opening a present. I know, it's like Christmas on a plate. Oh, Wow! There it is. You can see the steam coming off of it. It is going to be good. It comes with a side of vegetables, so let's not forget about those. Time for a taste test. First bite! Wow! This is cooked in a dill and basil sauce. It just melts in your mouth. It is so soft and so flavorful. It is delicious! Now for dessert we are having something that is called Khao Gam. It is purple sticky rice that has been cooked in coconut milk and it also has banana and sesame seeds on top. Down here! It looks amazing! If that weren't enough, we get a little shot of Tamarind sauce which we can pour over top. I'm going to try it the natural way without the tamarind sauce first. It is so fragrant. Nice and sweet? Very sweet. You can definitely taste the coconut and it is a nice sticky rice with a bit of a nutty texture. I like it. Let's try this with some tamarind sauce and a big chunk of banana. Oh my, it is so good. The tamarind gives it a kick and a bit of spice. It is still really sweet. That splendid feast came to just over $18 USD, 151,000 Kip which we think was excellent value. It is a bit of a gourmet type of restaurant. It is right by the river. You've got awesome views from here. Being back in UNESCO Heritage city Malacca, Malaysia on our one year travel anniversary was the perfect chance for us to eat Thali, an Indian meal made up of various dishes typically including rice, dal, vegetables, roti, papad, chutney and pickle. It is lunchtime here in Melaka and today we're eating at the Selvam Banana Leaf restaurant, which is an Indian restaurant. We've been here several times during the week. It is one of our favorite places so far. It is really popular with locals, so we're going to show you what a Thali set meal looks like. When I was backpacking in India three and a half years ago I subsisted off of Thali, so I'm thrilled to be having the opportunity to eat it again here in Malacca, Malaysia. Thali is an Indian meal that consists of various kinds of dishes. It can be served on a platter or - in this case- we're having it on a banana leaf if you take a look at it down here. It comes with different vegetables, curries and rice. Typically you would eat this using your hand; however, someone has to hold the camera, so I'm going to be using cutlery and Sam will demonstrate how it is done the proper way. Alright boy, dig in. Get them fingers dirty. You mix it around here. There we go. That's awesome stuff. Sam and I ordered two different Thali sets. He is having the vegetarian one and I am having the chicken but the only difference is that I get a little plate with a chicken curry on the side. Everything else we got was the same. We have the same dhal, the same rice and the same chips. Take a bite of that chicken to see how it tastes. I already have a chunk here. It is very tender and you can tell it has been cooked slowly for a long time. It is really good. Is it spicy? Of course, a bit of Indian spice in there. One thing I absolutely love about Thali is the concept of the bottomless refills. You eat until you're fully satisfied. That means if you go through your rice - and you finished your rice and you want more - you call them over and they load you up. It is perfect for a hungry boy. Our Thali lunch came to 22 Ringgit which is roughly $7 USD and that included three drinks, two different Thali sets (including a chicken and a vegetarian) and a roti pisang banana flat bread for dessert. So it is Saturday night in Chiang Mai and today we are heading to the Saturday Night Market. Well, we're still a few blocks away but I know we're close. You know why? Because I can smell the food. Background music playing. What do you got there? So I got myself a twisted potato which is a lot like the tornado chips we used to have in Korea. It looks like it is all seasoned? It's nice. Barbecued flavored. You're going to be sharing that? You are wasting the chips. Background music playing. Yes, blueberry. That looks good. It's like blueberry cheesecake with ice cream. It's going to be messy. Snow ice cream with blueberry sauce drizzled over top. How articulate. Mmmmmmm. Live music playing from the streets. Background music playing. So what did you get? I've got some pan-fried dumplings that are very similar to the Korean gun mandu that we often had when we were living as teachers in Korea. So let's see if these are as good? They look hot. Yeah. Pretty good. Background music playing. Someone found his favorites here. So what started as just a little snack out here at the market has turned into a full on feast. I've got dim sum and fried spring rolls. Looking good. I got this - German sausage. Very good. Background music playing. And in case we didn't quite have enough to eat - a sweet little dessert treat. So that is a banana and egg roti with lots of chocolate and condensed milk drizzled over top. Background music playing. We came to this night market. We were supposed to go for a walk but guess what? We ended up having a massive feast and so instead of exercise we were gorging the whole time but it was worth it. I've now traveled to over forty countries and I've yet to experience street food that can compete with Korea. Known locally as Pojangmacha, you can tantalize your taste buds with spicy, savory, salty and sweet street snacks. Two of my personal favorites include tteokbokki and hotteok. The following is a guide to some of our favorite Korean street -- warning -- I hope you're not hunrgy while watching this. And we are going to show you the different kinds of food you can buy in this alley. So that looks pretty appetizing. What do you have there? It sure does. Well we found some food on a stick here. Different kind of battered food objects. So if you want to take a look. We've got what appears to be a rice cake, kind of a lobster roll and as we go down a bit lower sort of like a hotdog/sausage thingamajig. And this is our first little snack food of the day. It looks tasty. Let's try it. Okay, I'm going to have the rice one. Very classy! Mmmmmm. Nice. Alright, now you are up. What are you going to have? I'm going to take a bite of the hotdog. Scarf it. Mmmmm. It's nice and spicy. Is it? This is really good. Yeah. You'll have to try this one. í˜¸ë–¡? ì–¼ë§ˆ ì£? 1000 ì›�ìž…ë‹ˆë‹¤. Okay, so we have got a delicious treat here called Hotteok. And it's a fried kind of sweet treat. Inside it's filled with cinnamon, honey and sugary kind of goodness. You bit into it and it's really warm. Perfect for the fall or winter. So I will take the first bite here. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's good. Mmmmmmm....haha So we've found ourselves a nice little back-alley to enjoy it. We're going to feast on the hotteok. It's delicious. Show us how it is done. It's hot. It's hot! Oh nice! The gooey-ness. It's made of honey. Malt. M A L T. Actually honey is liquid right? We boil this for one week. We make it solid because I have to show you a performance. It's hard. This is corn flour. Make a hole. Like this. Like this. Stretch. Stretch. Little by little. I have a clump of candy in my cheek. Nice. We just bought some sticky rice taffy and it is all natural. It is very sweet. It is kind of like a chewy candy. This would appear to be ice cream in some kind of cane. Look at what we've got here. Nice. Big enough? Go take a bite of that. Take a look at this. I think it is big enough to share. Well, good. Is that the biggest ice cream you've ever had? Yeah, that is really good. If you're looking to try Korean street food Insadong is one of your best bets in the entire country let alone Seoul. Speaking Korean. When traveling to Korea don't be afraid to sample as many Korean street food snacks as you possibly can -- your taste buds will surely be rewarded. Today we are biking out to Tra Que which is a little village. We're going for a special organic meal at a restaurant that grows its own vegetables and herbs. Oh, wow! Can you hear the sound of the water. This is Sam on the Waterwheel. You're a natural. If this isn't fun I don't know what is. You should move out here and take up farming. So this place is amazing. It's like a little organic oasis where they just grow different herbs and vegetables. Everyone is farming and it is so peaceful and quiet and it is beautiful. Look at all of the flowers around this. We have a very special drink here. It is called the water wheel drink. It's made with lemon basil seed and ginger. Let's take a sip of that. It tastes very healthy. In a good way or a bad way? In a pretty good way. Okay. Tra Que is a small farming community village located two kilometers northeast of the Ancient Hoi An town area. We just came here for dinner but if you decide to visit this village you can also work with the farmers for the day, you can take a rice paper making class or you can take a cooking class. If you've been following along with our recent food videos you probably have noticed we've been having these pancakes a lot and they are delicious. I have to say that the presentation of these ones down here looks the best. So these here are the best country pancakes we've had. What I really like about them is that they are not as oily or greasy as the other ones. They have a little bit of a fluffier texture. So this lovely presented dish is called three friends and there are three friends right in my hand. We have shrimp, pork and vegetables wrapped around. Pop that in your mouth. Friendly? I've got some good pals in my mouth. These tres amigos are almost too pretty to eat. Thank you. Easy. So here we have our colorful papaya salad and I didn't realize it was going to be this big. I started to think we ordered way too much food. Are you kidding me? With me here? Too much food? I'll take care of that. Well to sum up this meal I can honestly say this is the best dinner I've had since I've been in Vietnam. I absolutely loved the dishes. You could just taste the freshness in every single dish we had. The prices were really affordable. The portions were generous and it was cooked really healthy. Nothing was greasy or too oily. It was just absolute delight to come here and eat. I definitely agree. I think the long bike ride out here was definitely worth it and it is nice eating in such a quiet and peaceful setting just being surrounded by the farm. So we highly recommend it if you're in Hoi An. For lunch today we're having one of my favorite foods in all of Korea - Hamuel Pa Jeon. Jeon is a kind of Korean pancake. It's actually the very first meal I ever had when I came to Seoul many years ago, so this is an old familiar favorite. So this is the kind of meal that you eat as an appetizer before a really big feast or you can have it as an anju, which means you eat it as a side dish when you're having drinks. Background noise in the restaurant. So it appears we've got some kind of a rice tea or drink before our meals comes. We're just dishing it up. Let's see what it tastes like. Are you going to take a sip? Yeah, it's a kind of refreshing hot rice drink. Hot rice tea. Background noise in the restaurant. Music playing in the background. So it looks like we have a little soup here with some soy beans and healthy greens. Let's get some broth in here. So in my hands here is something called Makeoli. It's a Korean rice wine and it is something that can be made with both rice and wheat. Fermented rice and wheat. It is traditionally a popular drink with Korean farmers but now everyone loves it. So it comes in these cute little bowls. I'm going to show you what it pours like. It kind of has a white murky milky substance and it is the perfect drink pairing for what we've order - the Korean pizza - Pa jeon. They go together. So Makgeoli isn't too strong. It's typically 6 to 8 percent alcohol, so it's a nice social drink where you can have several cups. They've rolled the kimchi up nice and neat and cute. In fact, I think it's almost too cute to eat. Can you imagine? Kimchi too cute to eat? Okay, so here is. Cheers. Gumbai as they say in Korea. That's nice. Is it nice? Yeah, it is. Okay, time for a Korean cheers. Gumbai. Oh wow, that's massive. Gamsahamnida. Speaking in Korean Here is our Pa Jeon and it is a generous looking size. It's massive. We've got the tongs and the sissors to cut it up. You have expert hands. Background music playing. So it's just been lovingly cut up into nice little bite sized bits. And we are going to try it. Yes, I am. Once I'm able to pick it up. I'm going to dip it into the sauce, which is soy sauce. I know I'm not supposed to be using my hands but I want to make this happen. There we go. Mmmmmm That sauce is good. So Pa Jeon is the perfect meal to enjoy with a friend. It's often typically eaten during bad weather days. For example when it is raining or when I'm hiking together. It's a very social meal. If you look down here you can see the Pa is actually the green onion, the scallions. This here is what is called the Pa and because we have seafood and other objects like this. This is actually Hamul Pa Jeon. This is shrimp. There is a whole bunch of different vegetables and seafood. It's made with a salty pancake like dough. Are you feeling a little buzzed from the Makgeoli? No, I've hardly had any. Okay, what is your verdict for this meal? I really like it. I thought it was a great jeon. It was very tasty, the seafood was pretty fresh. Do you want to know when something has turned out to be a good meal? What? When you look down and there is not even a morsel left. I'll take the last one. There you go. Hahahaha. Some happy customers. Well, I love this meal. We took care of the Pa jeon here completely. And I probably knocked off 85 percent of the Magkeoli. I've got a nice little buzz going on right now. Oh yeah! I'm in a happy place. It is lunchtime here in Malacca, so we're about to go to a Baba Nyonya type of restaurant, which is a mix of Chinese and Malaysian cuisine. This is a real hole in the wall kind of place. It is. I am going to be showing you the Nyonya Laksa, which is spicy curry with a mixture of Malay and Chinese elements. Let's take a look. It is a coconut based curry soup and it has curd puffs, fish sticks, shrimp and clams added to it. It is very flavorful. What I am having next is called Rojak, which is the Malay word for mixture. It is a refreshing salad. Yes. Take a look over here. It is made using fruits and vegetables, so it has pineapple, cucumbers, bean sprouts. It is just a really nice and refreshing salad on a hot day. Oh yeah. The last of our four dishes is called Popiah and it is a spring roll that has an outside like a crepe. I'll show you the ingredients here. It has a sweet bean and soy sauce and it often has turnips and bean sprouts, tofu, peanuts and kind of omelet like. It has got everything going on. Take a bite. Classy! To beat the heat we have some lime juice. Is that refreshing? What has been your favorite dish so far? I've actually like this one here - the Nyonya dumplings - as I've never had this one before. I've tried the others but this is my first time for this. Okay, take a big bite and tell us why you like it. Struggling! What I really like about it is the glutinous rice. It is a unique kind of coating for the dumpling. Also, it is quite sweet inside. It is hard for me not to like sweet foods when it comes to me and my taste buds. What is Miss Audrey's favorite? Well, I've really enjoyed the rice dumplings as well but I think my absolute favorite has been the salad over here. I haven't eaten fresh fruits and fresh vegetables for almost a year because in Korea they cost a fortune, so I'm in heaven right now. I'm just eating and feasting on this. What do you got now - pineapple? Yeah, this is a pineapple. It is a nice sweet treat and the coating on the salad is delicious as well. It is a sweet sauce with peanuts on top, so it is just perfect. Today we are eating lunch at the Bale Well in Hoi An. This is a very small local restaurant. They have a fixed menu. Actually there is no menu. They just bring you food and you pay a fixed price and you eat as much as you want. There focus is on country pancakes and spring rolls. Which we both love! You take the salad, cucumber, kimchi and a spring roll. It is going to be crunchy. Now that is a special roll. That has got meat. Thank you very much. So I dip it here? Give it a try Audrey. Here we go. How is that? Wow, hard to bite huh? So you are going to what? Well, Sam here wasn't paying attention to whole assembly process, so I will have to demonstrate how to roll a spring roll. Okay, so we add a little bit of greens including some lettuce. A bit of fumbling with the chopsticks there. Hey, don't be hating. Then she said this is our kimchi which looks a bit different from the kimchi we ate in Korea. This is Vietnamese style Kimchi. It must be pickled vegetables. Then she added a spring roll. Don't forget the meat. Let's try this one. Yeah, try a smaller one. I don't know if it is chicken or beef but it looks good and smells good. Now that is a super loaded roll. Ok, now to roll it tightly. Viola! This is it. Now you add just a little bit of chilly to the sauce. It is kind of a peanut based sauce I think. And we dip and enjoy! Oh, there comes more food. Oh wow, here is the country pancakes. Yum. So this delectable roll. This time instead of the spring roll it has the country pancake inside of it. So we're going to give it a try. Is that better? These rolls are amazing! You've got pancakes, springs rolls, the greens, the skewered satay all in this. Happy boy! And if that feast wasn't enough we've got a little sweet treat to end off with. What flavor did you get? I got cherry. And the dessert just keeps on coming. Now we have fresh pineapples. Do you have any room for that? No, but I'll eat it. Okay, seriously that was the feast of feasts. Normally country pancakes or spring rolls or satay taste great on their own but all wrapped up together in one big roll dipped into a peanut sauce. WOW! Our lunch came to one hundred and eighty thousand Dong which is about nine dollars. I think that is a great price because they just kept bringing out plates and plates of food and we were stuffed and then they were offering us dessert and it was like 'oh, I don't want to turn it down I guess I'll eat it anyway' so yeah it was a great selection there. The service there is really friendly almost in a very unique kind of way. There was one time when the lady was coming over and she looked like it appeared she was going to be wrapping up a roll for us but instead she just grabbed a satay and plopped it right in Audrey's mouth and at the very end of the meal she came over and noticed I was looking hot and she undid a napkin for me. I thought she was going to put it in my hands. Oh, no. She just came and rubbed my whole face right down. Oh yeah. I'm hungry! I am hungry and this is my hungry face. I'm going to devour food. Today we're having a special Korean meal called Bulgogi which literally translates as fire meat. Paygo Pa In Korean Paego Payo means I am hungry and that is exactly how I'm feeling now. I'm hungry! In Korea the youngest person at the table is supposed to pour the drinks for their elders. Respect your elders! RESPECT! We are now cooking the Bulgogi and the Pulgogi is marinated beef strips in a lovely sauce. So Audrey here is stirring the Bulgogi and it is near the final stages of being cooked and the meat is really starting to look done here. I'm going to do a little demonstration on how to eat Bulgogi. So you grab a lettuce leaf and then you take some meat and plop it in there and you put some of this sauce (the samjjang). What else can we add? Maybe a little seaweed. Sure, you can add whatever you want. And then what do you do? Then we just roll it all up into a little ball and stuff it. Is it good? You look like you're almost choking on it. We are about to lift this stone pot rice lid. Look at that steam! So this lunch is a special meal that is called Cheonsik and in Korean Cheonsik means set course meal. That is why we have a lot more side dishes than usual. We have a special kind of rice today and it is purple in color and it has some kind of beans and also a nice looking date. Special times! These are our lovely side dishes. Let's start over here. So we have the tofu which is called dubu in Korean and it is all dressed up. This looks like some kind of raw meat and we're not sure what it is so we haven't touched it. Oh, it is octopus! I see the tentacles. Look on this side. Yummy. Are you going to try that? This one is our favorite is it not? What is one of the ingredients? This is pumpkin and potatoes. Yeah, kind of like a pumpkin potato salad. It is similar to a potato salad in western culture. This Bulgogi meat is very popular in Korea because it has a sweet flavor to it and it is also really popular in McDonald's and Lotteria because they use it to make burgers. The rice has been sitting in the stone pot for a while and now it is really crispy. Actually I can't even show you. This is a traditional table...no! Yes! So right here we have the Bulgogi. Places such as Lotteria...that is bad. Since we've gotten to Siem Reap we've been trying lots of International foods such as Korean. Today is no different - we are having a Burmese set lunch. Neither of us have had Burmese food much before, so this is going to be a real treat. Here is our first course of the meal. We have a nice soup. It is very hot. What kind of a soup does it appear to be? I'm seeing vegetables - cauliflower, carrots, lots of garlic and a bit of cabbage. I'm just going to try the broth. How does it taste? It is very flavorful considering it only has boiled vegetables in it. You should try some. It has also got a lot more ingredients than what we initially thought. There is ginger, garlic, chicken and it has been a nice surprise. The first of our many courses has arrived and we're starting off with a chicken curry and potato. I have no idea what it is going to taste like with my virgin taste buds being tantalized over here. How is that potato curry? Oh, that's really good. It has got a really strong curry flavor. It is very spicy as well. Flavor explosion over here. We've ordered a whole bunch of dishes with our set meal and we have a potato and chicken curry which is nice and spicy. We also got a fish and vegetable dish in a sweet and sour sauce. Over here we have a nice salad with tomatoes, cilantro and a bit of shrimp and garlic. That is also a bit spicy. We have some nice greens over here and all of that is paired with rice. We top it all off with a healthy fresh fruit dessert. So the verdict on Burmese food. Honestly, I can't say it is that distinct or that unique. I find that Burmese food has a lot of similarities to the dishes we've been trying in Southeast Asia. It has influences from around the region, for example Chinese with the sweet and sour and then you have a little bit of Indian with the curries and Southeast Asia with the tropical fruits mixed in. Today we are having lunch at the Mermaid Restaurant in Hoi An. This is a very famous restaurant in town and that is because it has two very special secret recipes, so we are going to be trying those two dishes today. The first dish that we are going to be introducing you to is called White Rose. As you can see over here it is a shrimp dumpling made using a translucent dough and it was named 'White Rose' when the French came because they thought it looked like a flower the way it is all bunched up together. It is a secret recipe unique to Hoi An and supplied by one family to the rest of the town. I'm going to pick this one up as you can see it looks like a little rose. How does it taste? It is really tasty. It has a nice shrimp paste and it also has some roasted garlic on top, so it has a really nice flavor. The next dish that we're going to be trying is called Cao Lau. It consists of noodles, pork and greens. It is also unique to Hoi An. The Cao Lau gets its special flavor from the water that comes from a well outside of the town. Or this distinct taste could just be from its spice caramelized broth. Delicious noodles. They remind me a lot of the Japanese Udon noodles. The meat is really chewy and flavorful and you can tell it has been sitting in the broth for a little while. This meal came to about five US Dollars which is a bit pricey for a local dish but then again we are eating at a famous restaurant with two secret recipes so that is what you pay. Eating noises Tonight for dinner we're going to show you one of our favorite Korean meals. It's actually Korean Chinese food. In every country Chinese food is a little bit different and Korea is no exception. This here is a typical Korean-Chinese restaurant. It's just a small little place. Hahaha! We have someone who is very hungry. So the last time we had Chinese food it was in Busan on our first trip together. And Sam ate so much that one night that he couldn't even walk afterwards and we ended up not even seeing the markets, not seeing the city. It was straight to bed for him. What you talking about! Actually, sadly it's true. Gamsahamnida! Yum Yum check this out. It's for one person. That's like a feast in a bowl. What is it? That's Jjajamyeong. Which is? It's noodles with a black bean paste and some onions. And this is an actual set we ordered. We got this whole massive feast. Like these are huge bowls. And we got sweet and sour pork. Now this is a value meal. For the two of us $13. Yeah! I'm already digging in. You are. Slurping noises. Stirring noises Eating noises Well, that's a long noodle! It sure is. Oh, it's so good. One of our favorite foods to have. So here we have this sweet and sour pork. It's breaded and deep fried and it's in a nice sweet sauce. And we also have a few veggies like onions, carrots and maybe coleslaw. Mmm....nice little surprise there. that's really good. It's quite sweet isn't it? MMMMM>...yeah In a Chinese Korean restaurant often the best value meals are the sets. We ordered what was Set A which included the two bowls of Jjajamyeong here and the Tongsuyuk the sweet and sour pork. This meal will leave us stuffed. We can't even finish it all. Oh yeah, that's going to fill us up for sure. Eating noises Stirring noises What are you doing? Just mixing in the black bean paste. Then I'm going to stuff my face. Eating noises. Hahahaha...You got enough? As usual in a Korean - Chinese restaurant you don't really get that many side dishes. We just have these lovely little radishes. That's the banchan. That's the Korean side dish. We've got so much to eat leftover. Well, I couldn't quite finish mine. It was just too much food. Sam did a little bit better. There is nothing left of mine. A true pig. But anyways, for someone visiting Korea and looking for a cheap budget meal that is delicious we recommend Korean-Chinese food. It's awesome! Here we are visiting a market again and that can only mean one thing - we are taking a cooking course yet again. Today we are going to be learning how to make Lao food and our first stop is Phou Si market. It is the biggest market in Luang Prabang and apparently it opens up at four in the morning. For our cooking class today it's an awesome surprise - we've got this lush garden setting. It feels like we're just walking into someones backyard. In Laos his wife and daughter cook for the family not the husband and son. This is culture. We don't put much sugar in Lao cooking like Thai food. You taste Thai food and it tastes milky and creamy and sweet because they add lots of coconut milk and lots of sugar. That is why the food tastes like that. Lao food is very different tasting like lots of herbs and lots of texture. This is Laos food. This does not mean Thai food is not tasty. Thai food is very tasty but our food tastes different. I'm pounding peppers, onions and that is it. Now time to try your tomato dip. I made mine really spicy accidentally because I thought we were cooking this. I'm making a little ball with the sticky rice. Voila! I'll dip it in here. How is it? It has a real kick to it but it is so good. It has lemon juice, hot peppers, garlic. I like it. I'd like to point out that Sam and I are making the exact same dish. This is his sauce. This is mine. What are you missing? Just about everything. We're making the Mok Pa fish and you are going to show us how to wrap it. What a work of art Audrey. Amazing! Oh, be quiet. It is going to taste amazing. We're cooking our buffalo meat right now. Here we have our buffalo salad. We stir-fried some buffalo meat and we also added bean sprouts,banana flowers, string beans, hot chilies and mint leaves. We're going to be rolling this up in lettuce leaves. It's kind of like a little fresh roll. For breakfast this morning we're having one of my all-time favorite foods - dim sum - and there are so many restaurants to choose from here in George Town but I'm going to my favorite. Let's go. There is a recurring theme in most of our morning videos and that is I'm usually not awake and that I'm being dragged out of bed to go do something. This morning it is Chinese breakfast again. What do we got? I believe those are shrimp dumplings. Could I have a cup of tea darling? You may and this is very hot. Burning yourself for love. No dim sum meal is complete without a cup of tea. Sam and his buns. Barbecue pork bun and red bean paste bun. One of the most fascinating aspects of eating at this dim sum restaurant is just how you order the food. All of the different ladies come by pushing these different kinds of carts some of them filled with dim sum and some of them are filled with pao. There are different kinds of buns. They have pork and all kinds of things. You just pick them and they put them right on the table. They have this little bill here and they check them off with the prices. You can see our bill right now and how it is shaping up. I'm sure we'll be ordering more. Which one did you try just now? I got a shrimp and veggie one and it is so tasty. Have a look? One of my absolute favorites is the barbecue pork bun. It just has so much flavor and it is 'wow' delicious. We've been trying lots of different dim sum. I find that the fillings are varied. You can get vegetables, pork and there are some with shrimp and then you have all of the sweet dim sum, which have a red bean paste. Those are the ones I like the most. The ones that I'm not a huge fan of. Again, lots of different variety. One of my favorite things about having dim sum is the social aspect. It is the kind of meal that you come and enjoy with friends over a cup of tea. I'm so full yet I keep eating more. Sam is certainly in his element over here. This is my local kimbap restaurant. We are at my local kimbap restaurant. This is a place where I eat several times a week. Sometimes several times a day. It is a very small space, a very quaint room and they have excellent food. Here is the menu here at the kimbap restaurant. As you can see a lot of things are between 2000 and 4000 Won. This here is our banchan. We've got kimchi, some egg rolls (kyeran) and I'm entirely sure what this is. I can see my rice being prepared here from a distance. This is awesome. Here comes my kimchi fried rice and soup. Alright. Here we are. We've got the chamchae jjigae, the spicy Korean soup with tuna. Over here is the kimchi fried rice which is typically topped with an fried egg on top. They brought us - they got it mixed up here. I'm having the rice and Audrey is having the soup. Is this what you order most of the time? Oh, yeah. This is my favorite meal - it is called Chamchae jjigae. It is kind of like a tuna stew and it is very spicy. It has onions and a little bit of tofu and some veggies. It also comes with a side of rice. It is quite healthy. It is a very filling meal and it is only a little bit over $4 USD, so I'm happy with the price. The nice thing about restaurants in Korea is that when you finish your side dishes you can always ask for more and it is all free. We've got two here to replenish. One of the reasons we like to come to the kimbap restaurant especially for me is that we do live a sort of a backpacking lifestyle. We like to save up for travel and by coming here we get to have delicious Korean food at a real cheap price. What are you having today? I'm having kimchi bokumbap, which is kimchi fried rice. It is also a spicy dish and it is my favorite way to eat kimchi. I really like it when it is fried. I already know it is going to be good. Tonight we're going to be trying a new dish here at our favorite restaurant. It is going to be our last time to eat here because I'm finishing my teaching contract and going back to Canada soon. Anyways, we're going to be trying the signature dish of this restaurant and it is called Dtalktoritang which is spicy chicken vegetable stew. I've had this before and it is delicious. We've always come here and had our Dolsot bibimbap and sundubu jjigae because we've loved it but this actually the signature dish at this restaurant and we're going to be eating it tonight. Yummy! How hungry are you? I'm hungry yeah! Hungry! Yeah! Let's see your hungry face? I'm hungry! My hungry lion face? Rawr. Come on - I'm hungry! Gamsahamnida (thank you in Korean). There comes the stew. Here is our hearty chicken stew and it is the perfect winter dish and it has got lots of pieces of chicken, potatoes, onions, vegetables and it looks really tasty and really filling. It is bubbly bubbly bubbly. Let's dig in! We have a nice piece of chicken breast over here. I'm loading up myself. Lots of potatoes and lots of chicken. This is the perfect dish now that the temperatures have dropped below zero. It is just so filling and it gets you feeling all warm. The potatoes are nice and soft and the chicken has been boiling for a while so it is very tender. It falls right off the bone. Yes, it is one of my favorite Korean dishes so far. I wish I had discovered it sooner. Too bad. Tell us your thoughts? How much are you loving this dish? I'm loving but I think you're loving it even more. One of the interesting things about this dish is that there are several different parts to the chicken here. There are drumsticks and various parts without bones. There is some work involved while eating. This is the bone section. Dtalkdoritang is what this dish is called and I'll break down the words we used. Dalktorri - tang means stew. You can imagine this as chicken stew. I have a feeling it might be chicken mixed stew or chicken spicy stew. It also has potatoes and onions and different things in it. It is steaming as you speak. This dish comes in a several different sizes. The one we got here is actually a small. If you take a look at it it is not small. That's a lot meat boiling there. It's a lot of meat and potatoes for two people. It also comes in medium and large size, so this dish we're ordering here is 19,000 Korean Won which is 17-18 USD these days. All of this for that price is really reasonable. The medium is 24,000 Won and the large is 29,000 Won. I'm guessing the large could feed an entire family and maybe even an entire extended family. It is just a lot of food and we're enjoying it. We polished off the stew. This is what is left of it and this actually the best part. The broth got really thick and it is flavorful and saucy. You like your saucy foods don't you? What a feast. What a great way to end my time in Korea. And I think you have a little sauce on your lips in the corner of your mouth a bit. No? This is day three in Chiang Mai. We just moved here a few days ago and we already have a favorite restaurant called Chang Chalaad. Today we are going to be ordering some classic Thai meals. I've been to Thailand probably close to ten times and this place literally has the best Pad Thai I've ever had anywhere. I like this dish so much. That is why I can't stop smiling. So Pad Thai is the kind of dish you know even if you've never been to Thailand. You can get this back in Canada or really anywhere in the world. The ingredients - well, it is a noodle dishes as you can see. It also has tofu because we got the vegetarian version. It has egg, peanuts, beansprouts, peanut sauce. It's just so tasty, so filling, so good. So what makes this the best Pad Thai I've ever had? Well, it's especially the sauce. This is the most tangy, sweet and rich. It's almost a bit creamy sauce I've ever had on a Pad Thai. This must be a secret recipe because I've never had anything quite like this before. It is just really really unique. So Chang Chalaad is sort of this tiny little unassuming restaurant that I first visited back in 2008. It has incredible food, so that has always been one of my biggest travel tips to try out these little small places. Try out these places that aren't on trip advisor or the Lonely Planet. They are often the best places you can eat. So the price of the Pad Thai was only 60 Baht, which is two US dollars. What a deal! Today we are at a Japanese restaurant and it is the kind of restaurant where the food just revolves around and you pick what you want. Let's see what we find. Sushi! Alright, so everything is completely self-serve. The different color plates mean different prices. I'm a huge fan of salmon so I will be eating a lot of the salmon today. I chose the grilled salmon here so I'm going to take a bit of this and see. That looks like a happy customer. I am happy. Here we have the menu of all different sushi you can get. Is that plural? Different kinds of sushi - that'll work. They are all different prices. There is a huge list, so it is basically you go here and you eat as much as you want and afterwards they stack up your plates and you get a bill. It is time for me to try the salmon here. You look like you're really enjoying that. That is so good. This totally reminds me of when I grew up. I grew up on Vancouver Island, Canada where I had smoked salmon all the time. My Dad would be smoking salmon in the summer and this totally reminds me of home. I love it. Time to put it in my mouth. How is the raw salmon? It is really good. There is my hot tea. That looks like water honestly. I don't even know what this is. It is supposed to be green tea but maybe not. What are you doing here. I'm making myself some green tea here. In Korean that is nokcha. I'm adding some green powder. We already have hot water here and I will swirl it with a chopstick I guess. It certainly looks green. Yeah, that is some nice green tea. Alright, so six stacked plates. That is all of the sushi we ate. That is close to eighteen dollars. It is a very cold winter day today so for lunch we've decided to have some Gamjatang, which is a hearty Korean stew. In Korea you cut everything with scissors - forget knives - this is the way it is done. Eat like the locals. The same with the kimchi. Let's chop that up. It looks nice and fresh. Here is the delicious stew and these are all of the different ingredients that we have for it. We've got some vegetables and lots of potatoes here on the side. It is going to be lovely. I'd like to know what the white stuff is. This is the kind of restaurant where you come to fight off a hangover by eating Haejeongguk. In our case, if you're freezing you come for a hearty stew like this one. Bubbling goodness. What are you eating over there? I'm just taking the meat off of the pork spine. How is the meat? Is it tasty? Oh, yes. Okay, it is time to dish it up. It is all cooked. You can see that the broth is a real thick and hearty looking with the different sesame seeds and all kinds of different paste. Gamjatang soup basically means that it has potatoes but there is also lots of other things in there. We have pork spine, there are some rice cakes, sesame leaves, sesame seeds, mushrooms and there was a white paste which we haven't really figured out what it was. We think it might be a sesame based paste. How would you describe the broth? It is a lot spicier than I was expecting but it is very flavorful. It is really good. Let's get a close-up shot. With the gamjatang you really have to make sure to stir it around so that it doesn't stick to the bottom. We kind of made that mistake earlier. I'll just add to the flavor. This is the meat after it has been de-boned. I like to dip it in the mustard sauce - it is really spicy and it almost reminds me of wasabi a little but with a mustard-y flavor. It definitely does have a bite and a little bit of a tang to it. Show us how it is done. Let's grab a little bit. That looks fatty. Here is a normal piece - that one. Here you go. You can just dip it and swirl it around. Delicious! We're almost finished the meal and what is left is basically just a thick collection of stew, meat and a few random potatoes and veggies. As you can see here our feast is complete. The cost of this meal was 25,000 Won - roughly 25 USD - a little bit less. Overall, our feeling was that although it was tasty and definitely delicious relatively compared to what we can get at other Korean restaurants it was a little bit expensive. We probably won't try this one again. We are at our new favorite restaurant in George Town. It is called Kapitan. Restaurant Kapitan. They serve up amazing Indian food. If you like rich savory curries and buttery naans you have come to the right place. Over here we have a tandoori set which I got. It came with a buttery naan bread and some nice curries. We also have Alo Ghobi over here with potatoes and cauliflower and some extra Naan because we just like it so much. We need double the portion. That chicken is superb. It is juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Wow! What flavor. How is the curry? It's so good. So so good! Aside from being a great restaurant in terms of the quality of food, the other thing we really like about coming here is that it is so affordable. You can just pick a whole bunch of different dishes, mix and match and you'll get a great meal. One of our absolute favorite dishes so far has been the Palak Paneer, which is really delicious and we've also really enjoyed the Tandoori chicken which is always fresh, crispy and the butter naan. That is good. This is a 24 hour restaurant and we like it so much we're considering coming for breakfast, lunch, dinner and maybe even a snack. So today we are having lunch at a little place called the Peppermint cafe. This is in some little back-alley in Chiang Mai. We're sitting outside right by the street and we're going to enjoy some more Northern Thai food. And you know how much we like our back-alley restaurants. Background music playing. We're here for original Thai food and good shakes. Looks like you got just that. So today we are having a dish that is called Khao Soi and if you just look down over here you can see that it kind of looks like a curry type soup and we have regular boiled noodles, some crispy noodles and chicken over top. So this is a Burmese influenced dish from Northern Thailand and it literally means cut rice. This is one of Northern Thailand's most famous dishes. background music playing. So I've had this dish once before and I think my favorite part is the combination of the soft egg noodles mixed in with the crispy ones. It's just a nice, crunchy, soft texture and the curry sauce gives it a bit of an extra kick, so here we go. I love coconut based curries and this is quite similar to Massaman Curry. background music playing. This is a really popular street food in Northern Thailand. It's actually quite hard to find overseas in Thai restaurants, so that means you have to come to Northern Thailand and try it for yourself. Empty plate over here. The sign of a good meal. Overall, that meal was delicious and coming in at just 59 Baht per dish - what value! We are at a Korean restaurant right now and we're going to be cooking our own barbecue. We will be grilling our own meat here at the table and it is a very tasty meal, so I'm excited to be eating it once it all gets here. How are you doing dear? Can you flip them? Just struggling a little bit. Nice skills with the chopsticks. Nice, nice skills. This is a very Korean thing. They usually bring you a pair of scissors to cut your meat instead of slicing it for you. They let you play chef at the table. It is almost like doing surgery here. Little snippets of meat being put onto the table. Now we just finished cutting up all of the pieces of meat and we're just cooking them a little bit longer. We want them nice and crispy. They have a lot of fat so I am trying to melt some of that away. This is going to be one delicious bite. Samgyeopsal and Ssamjang. Tasty! How does it taste? It tastes great. Okay, I am going to show how we have this delicious Korean barbecue the Korean style way. First, what we do is we grab a nice piece of leafy lettuce here and then we take a piece of the samgyeopsal (which is meat) and we dip it into this red sauce just like this pop it onto the lettuce, grab some springs and put those on and a piece of garlic. That looks delicious. It is going to be good. Then what you do is roll it into a bite sized shape - just like this - and some people take several bites but you know how I eat I am going to pop it all in. Is it ever good. Oh, I'm so full but it was so good. Okay, we just finished our meal and I am stuffed. I ate most of the garlic when Sam wasn't looking, so watch out. I knew I didn't get much. It was a very filling meal. I have no room for dessert. That is it. Today we're having another soup - Budae Jjigae. I'm hungry. Rawr! Today we are having Budae Jjigae. Budae Jjigae is not Korean traditional food. It was invented after the Korean war when American food (like spam and hotdogs) were very abundant. Apparently, it originated from an area we've been to before, Songtan. The ingredients in Budae Jjigae are often similar to what would be in other Korean stews. The main difference being that things such as spam and hotdogs, which you can see Audrey moving around here (and she stopped) were found around the American bases. There is also a kind of fusion stew, so there can be any kind of different ingredients thrown in. Sometimes you'll find noodles are put in. There is a lot of different things and it is getting steamy. Considering it has spam it is quite tasty. It is light and just a little bit spicy. As with all Korean meals this comes with rice, kimchi and other side dishes. Today we are in a very unexpected place - A Korean restaurant in Cambodia. I can't say I expected to be eating Korean food so soon after leaving. We've already got a craving. One of the things we've noticed since coming to Cambodia is just how much of a Korean influence is here. We've noticed that with the buses, all of the buses have been Korean. With have noticed it with guesthouses, restaurants and also just going into grocery stores we've seen Korean popsycles and this and that. And then you have all of the Korean K-Pop playing on the radio. Yes, we just head Psy's Oppa Gangnam Style. We complimentary sweet potato - Kokuma. Oh, that looks good! How is the sweet potato? It is the best sweet potato I've ever had and I'm not exaggerating it is really good. Korean food back home where we're from in Canada is actually really expensive but here in Cambodia - where the cost of living is a lot lower - it is actually a little bit less than what we paid when we were in Korea. Of course, every Korean meal comes with side dishes - the banchan. We have some of our favorites like Kimchi Jeon (Kimchi pancake). The million dollar question whenever we eat Korean food outside of home origin (outside of the home country) is it as good. Is it as authentic? And this here gets full marks as being very authentic and delicious. We just ordered our favorite Korean meals, which we used to almost eat daily when we were back in Korea. I'm having the sundubu Jjiggae, which is a tofu stew and Sam is having Dolsot Bibimbap, which is rice in a hot pot. It is crazy how much I'm actually enjoying this meal. The sundubu jjigae is something that I eat almost every single day for a whole year when I was in Korea and you'd think I'd be sick and tired of it but I'm actually been craving Korean food, so it is really nice to find it here in Siem Reap. Today's Valentines Day in Korea and instead of stuffing ourselves with copious amounts of chocolate we've decided to come and have a Korean traditional set lunch. So Korea has a lot of lovey dovey holidays for couples and we've actually managed to miss most of them, so there was kiss day in June I believe and hug day in December and we were unaware of these, so we've got to make up and celebrate Valentines Day this year. So by Korean set meal, what it is called locally is Hanjeongsik, and what that means is basically it's a set meal built around rice dishes (such as the dolsot stone pot rice set). What we expect to have is a lot of different side dishes and soups, so it's going to be a really big meal. Mmmm....I'm starving so I'm looking forward to this. Yes, me too. First off, they brought us juk, which is kind of like a soup, so take a look in here. And this black. I wonder what it is made of? Good question. I'll take a sip and let you know. Any guesses? I have no idea. Hahahaha! Is it good though? No, it's good - it's really nice. Oh, and there is jeon too. Little jeon. Gamhasamnida. Neh Background music So our feast has arrived. It's a pleasant surprise. We really didn't know what we were going to get, so we'll give you a bit of a tour here. Over here we've got something called Bulgogi, which is marinated beef strips. Down here it looks like we've got a normal salad. Jeon, which is a Korean style pancake, which we both love. This looks like a sort of mini kind of Tonkatsu, mini cutlet and another kind of salad and chapchae. We've just been brought one more dish here, which is called Bosam, a kind of steamed meat. So the Bulgogi is finished cooking now we're going to dish it up. Let's get some veggies in there too. And the Bulgogi is known for having a sweet sauce. What it is being marinated in is actually quite a sweet sauce. How does that look? That looks awesome. It's steamed up. Time to try it. MMm...it's awesome. The meat is really tender. Really nice....soft....MMMMMM. What do you got there? This is the most delicious Pa Jeon I've had since I've been in Korea. Korean pancake? It's a little Korean pancake with lots of green onions and this one also has seafood. It looks like octopus maybe. And it's so good. Very crispy isn't it? MMMMMMhmmmm. Flavorful? There are so many side dishes to choose from that it's a little difficult to decide what you're going to eat next. Music playing in the background. So I really thought the meal was over after the first set of dishes came out but behold there is even more to eat. All kinds of goodness ranging from fish to soup and here is the dolsot, the stone pot, rice. What we're going to be doing right now is we're actually going to be scooping out the rice from the stone pot and then adding water to burnt sides of it. And what that does is it creates a rice soup. So Audrey is scooping it out. So at this point we scraped out all of the rice from the main part. As you can see we've put it in the bowl and now we've just got the rice on the side. We're going to add some hot water and turn it into a soup. Sizzling water boiling sound. Cover it up. And we wait. Water boiling sound. Steaming Looks like we've put a little bit too much water in here. It's actually bubbling over. That's my rice just bubbling next to me on the table. So here is my whole fish. I'm just trying to get some meat off the bone, so I have to take out the spine. It's kind of difficult. A morcel. It is time for the official unveiling of the stone pot. Da da dun da dun. So now we have a little rice soup. It's kind of a murky looking soup. Audrey will try it. Hopefully not burn myself. It does look very hot. Mmmmm, it's very sweet. Is it sweet? It's like a sweet tea with rice in it. It was a great meal. I'm personally stuffed. And there are still so many dishes I never got around to trying. It was just very very filling. So much food. Would you come back again? I would definitely come back here. Definitely feel the same way as Audrey. one of the better value meals I've had in a long time. It's just awesome. Today we are having dinner at a great little restaurant that is located right across from the Puduraya bus terminal in Kuala Lumpur and it is Indian food. My favorite! Nothing like refreshing fruit drinks to start your meal. Here is our food. Nice! Thank you! Delicious. What we are having today is called Roti Canai and it is an Indian flat bread. I've got one that has cheese inside and I'm going to dip it in the curry sauce. The roti canai is the Malaysian form of flat bread. Oh yeah! What we're having here is roti canai. Roti means bread in Hindi and Malay. Canai in Malay means to roll out the dough. How do you roll it out? Show us. Nice. It is made with egg flour and water and in special cases where there is special ingredients like this one here - cheese! Sam is feeling a little shy because there is people watching him eat right now. Is it the freckles? Is it the t-shirt? Is it because he is using his hands? It's s spectacle. What could it be? There are two ways to eat roti canai - by hand or by utensil - and believe me I will not give up an opportunity to use my hands. Demonstrate for us. Mix it up really good. That's sloppy! You just wiped it on your pants! No, I didn't. Audrey here will be having it using utensils. I on the other hand am eating like a lady using a fork and spoon. Keeping it classy. So roti canai is thinner than the Indian style Naan bread which a lot of people are more familiar with. It is thin in the same way as chapati for example. You can get plain roti or you get a little fancier with your order and they have banana roti, garlic roti, cheese roti and egg roti. Yes, I had that earlier. Lots to choose from! One of the coolest things when we come here to the restaurant is the little order you get. You just keep tallying it up here on the side and eventually when you're finished feasting they finally give you a total. This is a meal that you can have for breakfast, lunch or dinner. We're having it for dinner right now and I'm pretty sure I'll be coming back for breakfast. Get ready! It is Saturday morning and normally on a weekend I would expect to wake-up late and maybe have some waffles or pancakes for breakfast but instead I've been dragged out of my apartment way too early to eat Ox Bone soup. In the cold! I'm on? Woo! One of the nicest things about this restaurant here is that it has the heated floors, which in Korean is called Ondul. We were walking around in the subzero temperatures and now we're warming up our butts on the ground. What has arrived at our table is called Seolleongtang and it is an ox bone soup with brisket. This is what it looks like - it has got kind of a murky white color. I'm going to stir it. This is instant noodles and here is the brisket. This soup comes with rice as you can see and we also have some veggies and kimchi that we can supposedly add to our soup. Kimchi in a jar. I think this is what we add to our soup - all kinds of onions. Oh, more of the radish kimchi. She is chopping up the kimchi. That is how it is done. Doesn't that look good? It sure does. Is it time for the first bite? Okay, let's try the broth first. I can not say it is very flavorful. It is like water. Yeah? Let's add more things to it. Okay. We've just grabbed the salt - hopefully this will make the soup a little less bland. Let's add a little. Do you want to add some more. Alright, let's give this a stir. Try a bit with the broth. Experimenting here. That is better but it needs more. Lots more! We've found even more seasonings here. We've got some pepper in an attempt to really spice things up a little and to add a little zest. Let's stir it. Let's try that now. It is much better - okay good. I am trying the brisket here. How does it taste? It is nice and tender. It is a real 'nice' cut of meat and not fatty at all. After doing a little bit of research on this dish, on wikipedia, I read that often rice can be added into the Seolleongtang, so that is exactly what I'm going to do. I'm going to take my bowl of rice and plop it right in. That is definitely going to thicken things up here. Let's try that. Not too bad. Audrey is going to try the noodles. How are those? They are really tender and really soft. Are they soft? Yes. The verdict: I can't say I would eat this soup again. I really wanted to like it but it is just too bland. It is white rice and plain noodles and a white murky broth. There is no spice, so I prefer the Hajeonguk or the Dtalktoritang. I am sad. Or the sundubu jjigae. Yes. Okay, so what did you think of the soup? Well, I have to agree with you on this. It wasn't my favorite. I did finish it but I do like so many Korean spicy and flavorful soups. One of the ones love are some of the ones you mentioned but also sundubu jjigae, kimchi jjigae and so many others. It just didn't quite hit the spot but it was okay. Gamsamnida (Thank you in Korean). Basically what shabu-shabu is a kind of hot pot Korean style hot pot. What we do is we have different ingredients here. Thin slices of beef putting in, greens, different vegetables here already in the pot and we've got noodles at one point and over here this is what we're going to be putting in to make the rice at the very end. It's a lot of different courses to this meal. Basically, eventually we're going to get all of these different ingredients and meat into here and it is a spicy type of hot pot. It's perfect for the winter season. We're going to put some of the vegetables in the soup right now. Snip snip. All the leafy goodness. That looks tasty. One of our favorite aspects of these communal Korean meals is the do it yourself part. We're cooking a bit of the meal here. Next up is the meat. Plop it right into the pot and it cooks very fast. That is why you don't want to put it in at first. It's good to cook to the vegetables first because of that reason. Apparently, the name Shabu-shabu is derived from an onomatopoeia meaning that the Shabu Shabu sound is supposed to indicate the swishing sound of the beef cooking in the hot pot sauce. Shabu shabu! Shabu-shabu! Bubbly bubbly bubbly bubbly! Now it is noodle time. Oh my gosh okay! There we go. Disaster averted. Yeah. That makes it a lot more thick with the noodles. I'm really enjoying the meal so far and my favorite part is the thin strips of beef and you can dip that in a wasabi and soy sauce mixture and it is really strong and really potent. It has made my eyes water a couple of times. Let's see you do the demo. Let's see a demo here. I'm not sure there is any beef left. I've devoured most of it. Dip it into the wasabi. Let's soak it and the camera is all fogged up now. Here I am with the thin strip of beef and I'm going to be dunking it into the soy sauce wasabi combo. Absolutely delicious. Mashiketa (delicious in Korean). A Korean lady is over there making our bokumbap - our fried rice - and she is using some of the leftover ingredients from the Shabu-shabu as well as mixing it into the pot. Here comes our fried-rice bokumbap. Look at that! The best part is that if you leave it for a while it gets crispy on the bottom, so you get a nice crispy golden rice. Hold on - it is really hot! Tasty? Oh yeah. This meal cost Man Gu Cheon Won which is 19,000 Won which is less than 19 USD. It's a pretty good price. It is the meal that keeps on giving. You get the soup, the vegetables, the beef, the noodles and the rice at the end. You also get complementary coffee. What is not to like? It's a lot of food for free. Hawker Centres, which are open air food stall complexes, serve up a variety of inexpensive food. From Chinese to Indian and Malaysian to Indonesian there is a diverse selection of cuisine to choose from. We're having our first lunch here in Singapore at a Hawker Center and I've ordered myself some Chinese food. I have some Hainanese chicken rice, which looks absolutely delicious and I've got a butter chicken with butter naan right down here. Here is my dish - it is just a bit of plain rice and some chicken with crispy skin on the outside. Despite it looking a bit bland it is actually quite tasty. It is hard not to enjoy butter chicken - this is awesome. We've got a few more snacks to complete the meal. What are they? This is a combination of satay and dim sum, so we have sweet potato here and this one is yam. We've got tofu cubes over here. This one is prawn and I believe that is a shrimp dumpling. I'm going for something a little sweet here. I have some kind of yam spring roll. Should I dip it in peanut sauce? Nah, just have it. Is it sweet? It is. It tastes like sweet potato except that it is white. This crab didn't go on a skewer and it will taste good in the peanut sauce I'm pretty sure. We'll mix that bad boy around. What is happening over there? Kind of chewy? Here is the crab! Nice claw. Oh, that is delicious. It is so juicy inside. As budget travelers these Hawker centres in Singapore are a real find. Because it is really expensive in Singapore - it is one of the most expensive cities in all of Asia - certainly in Southeast Asia. You can find dishes here for between four to ten Singaporean dollars and it is so much cheaper than eating in a restaurant. I like the variety that you can find at the Hawker centers. For example, today we had some Indian food, Chinese food and we also saw stands selling Malaysian food, Singaporean dishes and lots of other things. This Hawker center is by the Singapore Flyer but you can find them all throughout the city. We are at Tek Sen restaurant in George Town in Penang today. Not to be confused with Texan food because this place is actually a Chinese restaurant. And it is spelled T-E-K S-E-N. Background music playing. So this is one of the most popular restaurants in all of Georgetown for locals and if you don't come at the right time you have to wait for a table. And if a restaurant is popular with locals I know I'm going to like it. Background music playing. So this here in the mapo tofu. Apparently, it is one of Sam's favorite dishes and I'm going to try it. Oh, it's so hot. It's like tofu mixed with ground beef in a really rich sauce that is kind of spicy. I like it. Background music playing. Oh, wow. Is that ever good. It's crispy chicken in a sweet plum sauce. Background music playing. That's just your standard fried rice with shrimp, a little bit of veggies and some meat. It's really tasty. Here are some Chinese chopsticks. Better. Background music playing. Nothing quite as refreshing as lime juice. Are delicious Malaysian Chinese feast came to thirty three Ringgit, which is roughly eleven US dollars and it was worth every single Ringgit. Background music playing. You know we love to eat, so today we've signed up for a cooking course where we're going to learn how to make some of our favorite Thai dishes. Right now we're at the local market, so we're just going to be walking around picking out some of the ingredients we'll need today for the class. Let's have a look. Judging from the amount of cooking videos we make you'd probably think that we're constantly in the kitchen and that we always like to cook. That couldn't be further from the truth. Most of the time when we're on the road we eat out, so this is actually kind of an excuse to get into the kitchen and cook and to actually try and make food because normally we don't do that. We have now arrived at the Thai Farm Cooking School. We drove about seventeen kilometers outside of Chiang Mai and it is a completely different world out here. We're just surrounded by nature and an organic farm. We're actually going to be picking a lot of vegetables from here. We had a choice between doing the cooking course in the city or going out to the countryside and I think we've made the right decision. Now clean rice already. Please come inside. I would like you to pick by yourself the whole leaf basil. I'm making my Yellow curry paste. Pound, pound, pound! Harder! Faster! Stronger! So Sam is lagging a little behind right? Come on. Master Chef here - look at that. Perfection. No, I really am lagging behind, I better hustle up. I'm making a yellow curry today. This is mine. This is what I created and Sam went for the green curry, so this is his. And I'd like to point out I don't think he did a very good job. Oh, that just fell in there. What is this? Whatever. Total chunks. You get an F! Alright, oh! It's boiling! It is not supposed to boil. We're making the Tom Yum soup. Mine is going to have shrimp and I've got my coconut milk here, so I'm going to be adding some ingredients - mushrooms, onions. I'm ready to try fine creation. This is my Tom Yum with shrimp. Let's see. I made mine really sweet. I think maybe I put in to much sugar but it is kind of nice and creamy because I used coconut as a base. You need to add more salt or fish sauce then. Mine does need more salt. How is yours? You look like a farmer drinking soup. I'm keeping this hat I swear. I'm quite happy with mine. I put quite a bit of salt in it and I also put fish sauce. I'm making my Yellow curry now. I'm just stirring the coconut milk. I put in the curry paste I made earlier. There is also some pumpkin and potatoes and I accidentally added some leaves that I wasn't supposed to but shhhh.....Cheater! Not that we've chopped everything up we're going to be throwing this into the Wok and making our stir fried rice. I was wrong about this dish. It is not a stir fried rice. It is just a vegetable stir-fry. It's really good. I made one with chicken and string beans and mushrooms and here is my yellow curry with potatoes and pumpkin. Is it good? Uh-huh. At this point in the day I'm getting completely stuffed. I actually wouldn't mind taking a siesta right now but we're going to be making two more dishes. I'm going to be making a Pad Thai and then a Mango Sticky Rice. So I'm suffering from what my family calls bulbous plumptitude. I'm making Pad Thai. Your favorite. Here is my Pad Thai which is probably one of the easier Thai dishes you can make. We saved the very best for last. Here we have our favorite Thai dessert - Mango Sticky Rice - and it has some deep fried Mung Bean on top. It is crispy. This is going to be good. Alright, let's check out that first bite. It is nice and coconut-y and it is amazing. So overall that was a really cool experience learning how to cook Thai food. I made five different dishes. I'm beyond full. Like I feel like I'm ready to hibernate now. So this was 1100 Baht. It was like lunch and dinner and the thing I really liked about this particular school was that it was out in the countryside where we were able to get outside of the city and away from the pollution and whatnot and just have a really cool organic cooking experience. Today we are visiting the Shin Old Tea House where we will be enjoying a cup of traditional tea. Right now we find ourselves in a very cozy little tea house. It is very cute. They have low dim lighting and tapestries and pillows on the ground, so we've ordered ourselves some nice fruity teas. This tea house is located just off of Insadong, which is known as sort of the cultural hub street of Seoul. We've found this quaint little place. As we've placed our orders we have some delicious looking snacks. This looks like rice cake and maybe another rice cake covered in honey with little cereal chunks on top maybe. Let's try this. Crunchy huh? Okay. It is like puffed rice - like rice popcorn maybe. It has like honey on the outside and it is very sweet and airy. Here is the ginger tea and the masilcha is the plum tea. How is the plum tea? It is delicious. Mine is so sweet it is almost like liquid honey but it is not too overwhelming. It is really nice. There is plenty of flavor aside from it being sweet. What kind of tea did you get over there? I got ginger tea. The same thing - it is a nice sweet tea with a really strong ginger flavor. It is just a perfect way to warm-up on a winter day. Oh, yeah. I'm going to try one of these now. It is a rice cake with a green swirl in it. I'm not sure what the green swirl is because I can't taste any difference. Is it kind of plain tasting? It is just a regular rice cake. We're receiving heat from two different sources - an electric fan up above us and then we also have the ondul system on the floor. The heated floors by the heated pipes underneath. We're as toasty as you can get. I feel like I could take a nap in here. I probably could too. Getting off of Insadong's main strip is a really good idea because it is usually in the back alleys where you can find traditional restaurants, traditional tea houses and just quieter places. It is much better value and also has traditional homes as well which is the same as here. We are finished sadly our tea is gone. It is time to wrap things up and head back into Insadong for a little shopping and maybe some cake. Today we are having lunch at the Green Moss in Hoi An and this happens to be a cooking school but it has more of a casual feel. Basically, you choose two dishes from the menu and then you pay an additional two dollars and you get to go into the kitchen and cook it yourself. That is what we'll be doing. Believe me when I say this ""If I can do it. Anyone can."" We are entering into the kitchen and we're making a cooking video. Audrey is up first. First like this? You roll one time. So you cover it up? So then we get the sides tucked in? And then we finish as tight as possible. There you go. Not so bad. It is great. It is like we're an exclusive peak into the kitchen. This is how we're making Pho. Can I try? Two tablespoons. Here are the first few dishes we've prepared. We have the Pho and the fresh spring rolls. Let's go eat it. Take them to the table and devour them. Here is the spring roll that Audrey personally rolled herself. No, I didn't. You rolled it. Do you remember? Let's see how it turned out. This is one of my favorite dishes at this restaurant. It is just such a nice fat spring roll. How is that Pho? Delicious, and prior to learning how to make this I didn't realize how many different ingredients went into this dish. You can really taste the flavors. Next up we will be making a vegetable Cao Lau. So the Cao Lau noodles are made from the water used an ancient well and apparently it is quite secret. Not only in Hoi An. Unique noodles to Hoi An. It is harder. It's a crispy noodle. Now we're making our very last dish the vegetable pancake and it happens to be my favorite one. We've got a lot of multitasking going on. We've got the tofu simmering, we've got the noodles being steamed over here and we've got the pancake mixture ready to be spread on the frying pan. So that is when we know it is done? Okay. Take fermented soy bean sauce. Here is the finished product and this is round two of our feast. It was a fascinating experience getting to see how all of this food was made in the kitchen. We're going to show you how to roll the country pancake in a rice paper, so that it is easy for dipping into the sauce. And a big bite. Oh, yeah. The pancake is nice and crispy and the sauce is kind of sweet. It has a bit of a tomato ketchup base I believe but it is also spicy because we added all of the chilies. It is a nice combination of flavors. How is the Cao Lau? I love it. What really stands out with the Cao lau is the taste of the noodles. They are just really unique to this area and I love them. So the texture of the noodles are a little bit crispy and it almost tastes a little bit like they are under-cooked but that is what makes them quite unique. We just finished our cooking class at Green Moss and it was a little bit different from previous cooking classes we've taken. This one was a little bit less hands on and more watch and learn, which is great because we got to watch a professional make it and the dishes turned out great. Everything was tasty. That is the first kind of cooking class where it has been more of a just a demonstration only that I've taken before. And I really enjoyed it partly because I'm really slow at preparing food but the other reason was it was so hot in that kitchen. I don't think I've ever sweated that much, so I could barely handle being in there as long as I was. Had I been preparing the food I may have passed out on the ground. So today we are going to a local restaurant in Nha Trang. It is called Au Lac and it is the kind of restaurant that doesn't even have a menu. You just go in there and sit down and they bring you a plate of food. That is what you get. Pure vegetarian feast. Tofu central. And we are here. So here we are just piling on everything. All kinds of different veggies; there is different tofu. This is a typical meal at Au Lac. Essentially it is just a big plate of rice and on top they pile lots of veggies, different tofu. It is just a healthy meal that tastes great and it is cheap. How is the tofu? The best tofu I've had. Ever? Ever! Wow! That's pretty good. So we got a little soup with our meal and it has cucumber and zucchini and also centro. Nice flavors. So tell us how much did that vegetarian feast cost? It cost thirty five thousand dong, which if you're doing the math is one dollar and seventy five cents US. That's not per person. That is total. For two soups, two plates of rice covered in vegetables and tofu. What a deal! One of the best tips I have for saving money while backpacking is to eat at local joints and restaurants because you'll get authentic food at rock bottom cheap prices.",False,20141108 - 40 Asian Foods to try while traveling in Asia ∩╜£ Asian Street Food Cuisine Guide.en.srt

Mai,Bangkok,Kuala Lumpur","[Music] [Music] so today we are taking a fun little day trip outside of Chang maai we are visiting the elephant Nature Park which is about 60 kmet outside of the city and this is an elephant rescue and rehabilitation center so we're going to be showing you around so this Center is also a refuge for a number of injured and abandoned animals such as dogs cats water buffalo and [Music] others so we have a bucket full of fresh fruit and on today's menu for the elephants are bananas and [Music] watermelons baby oh there you go [Music] so that was my first time touching an elephant and their skin is surprisingly coarse and hairy so right now the rescue center is home to 37 elephants 32 of them are female and five of them are males and these are Asian elephants which vary from the African elephant elant the African elephant is actually a lot larger than the Asian elephant and they also have much bigger ears most of the elephants on site have been rescued from the logging tourism and Bing [Music] industry happiest time of day the elephants are now being bathed [Music] so overall the experience at elephant Nature Park has been phenomenal we've really enjoyed having the opportunity to feed bathe and interact with all of the elephants and it's a great alternative to doing the trkking where you're just sitting on top of the elephant and they're working this way you get to spend time with the elephant in its natural environment feeding it and just having a great [Music] time today we are visiting a special little place we got up super early at 5: in the morning and check it out this is where we are and corw Cambodia [Music] we are inside Anor wat and this is the largest religious structure in the whole world so this is my very first time visiting Anor wat but Sam over here has been to this place a whopping four times World traveler much so how is your fourth time here different from the first second and third tell us well the temples are certainly still as impressive as ever but there are so many more tourists here than when I first came it's I would say tripled quadrupled maybe even more than that it's just unbelievable how many people are sharing the experience [Music] so this is actually a Hindu temple that was dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu and the temple was built by a Cambodian King who helped unify the country and to also spread the C influence across southeast Asia one of the most most impressive things about this Temple here is actually the mass of moat that surrounds it it's one of the first things you notice as you're coming up to the temple [Music] m [Music] there are several options for booking tickets to visit the temples of Anor we went with a three-day option and that was $40 but you can also go with a one-day option two-day option or if you really love temples 7 Days wow but I imagine that's quite pricey a good time to come to Anchor watt is actually right at lunchtime because a lot of the tourist buses and tourists are out having lunch or are at that point in the day templed out which means they're they're really hot they're tired they're sort of they've seen enough temples for the day so if you want an alternative time to come definitely consider coming around you between say 12:00 and [Music] 1:30 coming back for the for time was amazing I never get tired of this place but one funny observation I have is that I notice that any family is dragging along bringing their children children really didn't seem to be enjoying this as much they just dragging their feet I think it has a lot to do with the heat and humidity outside right now it's just it is really really hard to be walking around and not sweating profusely I really enjoyed getting up early and coming to watch the sunrise at Anor watt I thought that maybe the experience wouldn't feel special because there are literally hundreds of people also here at that time of day but it felt kind of like we were sharing the moment together so I really enjoyed it [Music] [Music] so we have made it to long prang and this city has quickly become one of my favorites here in Southeast Asia this is the cultural Hub of LA and we're going to show you a few of the things you can do around [Music] town so when you're visiting langang prong it's really easy to stick to the city center there's so much to do and see there but if you have a Time come outside and explore the outskirts of the city come check out the more rural sections right now we're going across a bamboo bridge and we're going to see what's on the other side lead the [Music] [Applause] [Music] way because this is a very small City it's really easy to find yourself in the countryside so that's exactly what we've been doing just wandering down rural areas and we even found a dog to to join us for the [Music] walk and now we are upright and early for a biking tour around the city we picked up these bikes for 20,000 Kip which is $22.50 and we have them for the day so we're going to be cycling around let's see what we find [Music] [Applause] When comparing L long bong to other cities in Southeast Asia there are some major advantages one of them being that there's hardly any traffic here it's a wonderful opportunity to take out your bicycle and just explore you can go down the main roads you can go down the side streets and you're not going to have to deal with cars and other bicycles or even [Music] pedestrians Wong pong is very pedestrian friendly in fact there are so many different little back alleys and Lanes to explore that it's just a great idea to wander about without any sense of direction [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] there are some fantastic views in the city so one of our recommendations is to enjoy a meal by the river which is what we're doing tonight [Music] another thing you'll want to do when you're in luang prang is to visit all the temples around the city this morning we are visiting watang thong and it's one of the main temples in Wang prang it is also known as The Golden City Temple and it really has some impressive glass mosaics so you'll want to wander around and take some photos [Music] 20,000 Kip to enter which is $2.50 American and like most places it's good to come early because it starts to get busy during the middle of the day now it's time for us to get a little bit of exercise we're going to climb up 328 steps up Mount fousey which is actually more like a hill for the best views of longang [Music] [Music] Pang so admission to reach the top of this mountain is 20,000 Kip which again is $2.50 and it's kind of cool going up because you go up one way and then you come down the other side of the mountain so you get to see different views along the [Music] way and how could we have a list of things to do in a city without focusing on the local Cuisine we're here at our favorite rest in Tamarind we've been here so often it's literally our home away from home and we're going to show you a few of our favorite [Music] dishes platter so this over here is a coriander pickle next we have an eggplant dip tomato dip we have a paste made from buffalo skin we have some seaweed chips and then some vegetables that we can use with the sauce so let's dig in and that all goes together of course with our sticky rice so Sam is going to demonstrate for us this is how you eat it you just kind of put together a little ball like that and then you can pick a different dip I'll try the buffalo sauce here it together just like that pop it in your mouth delicious so this is the second plate we've ordered again here we have a vegetable pickle this is a pork salad that also has banana flowers we have a pork sausage here's some Buffalo jerky Sam's favorite oh yeah and over here we have some little lettuce rolls that are stuffed with different dips different sauces so we'll be trying those we've ordered some so much food we almost forgot about this next dish but it's time for me to do the honors I'm going to unveil our steamed fish which comes wrapped in a banana leaf and it's called MPA let's see what's in here it's like opening a present I know it's like Christmas on a plate oh wow there it is oh you can see steam coming off of it that's going to be [Music] good and when the Sun goes down it's time to go shopping we're at the tour night market and we're picking up souvenirs [Music] there's one thing that langang Pang is known for it's for its Elms giving Which happens at 6:00 a.m. every morning this is where mons collect Elms of rice from kneeling locals and tourists [Music] [Applause] [Music] on how not to be a total wanker at the ceremony first don't use your flash don't blind the monks and secondly don't chase them down you see people doing both of these things and it's infuriating if you love to eat like we do and you can't leave longang Pang without taking a cooking class today we're at the FY Market we're picking up ingredients before we start preparing our food much sugar love cooking like Thai food you you taste Thai food taste milky creamy sweet because they add lots of coconut milk lots of sugar that's why the food tastes like that lot food when eat taste lots of herb lots of texture this is lovely so I'd like to point out the samai are making the exact same dish this is his sauce this is mine what are you missing just about everything so here we have our buffalo salad so we we stir fried some buffalo meat and we also added bean sprouts there's banana flowers we have string beans hot chilies and mint leaves so we're going to be rolling this up in lettuce leaves it's kind of like a little fresh roll [Music] [Applause] [Music] today we're going to be having a special experience we are taking a bamboo train along these old tracks that used to run from nen all the way to Baton ball [Music] [Applause] so this train is really just a bamboo platform with a few mats laid over top it has a six horsepower engine and we are going to be speeding through and see what we find we're on the B Train F yeah really really yeah oh yeah [Applause] [Music] [Music] spee [Music] foree face this morning we've got a special activity plan we are taking cooking class Kim cooking class and I'm all thumbs in the kitchen but I'm going to give it my best shot right now we are at the local market and we are going to pick up some ingredients for the cooking cloth and it's raining a red curry paste and it's a chili paste yeah so these are vegetables very very fresh vegetable and then they said Ginger but it is not a ginger it is galangal coconut and then she gr it you she grating to get her meat coconut meat so so we've got our aprons on ready to cook and they Converse

her husband toot they will take you to the market and you will spend an hour there just looking at different vegetables picking up ingredients and then afterwards you come back to the school you cook

blocks away but I know we're close you know why cuz I can smell the food [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's me friends what you got there so I got myself a Twist potato which is a lot like the tornado chips we used to have in K yeah looks like it's all seasoned and nice barbecue flavored and you're going to be sharing that you're wasting the chips [Music] [Music] yes blueberry good it's like blueberry cheesy snow ice cream with blueberry sauce drizzled over top how articulate m [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so what did you get I've got some pan fried dumplings very similar to the Korean goon Mandu that we often had when we were living as teachers in Korea so listen see if these are good they look hot pretty good [Music] someone found his favorites here so what's started is just a little snack out here at the market has turned onto a full on Feast I've got dimsum and fried spring rolls looking good and I got this German sausage very [Music] good and in case we didn't quite have enough to eat a sweet little dessert treat so that's banana egg Roy with lots of chocolate and condensed milk drizzled over [Music] [Music] [Applause] top came to this night Mark that we were supposed to go for a walk but guess what we ended up having a massive feast and so instead of exercise we were gorging the whole time but it was worth it welcome to Singapore we've got less than 48 hours in the city we're going to show you as much as we possibly can with limited time taking down to visit the world's most prosperous city state and busy as Port we set out on foot bus Subway and boat to cover as much ground as we possibly could Singapore has often been given the title of the sterile Utopia however after traveling around chaotic Southeast Asian hubs like Bangkok koala lumur and Saigon it was a welcome relief to visit a mega city that was clean orderly spacious and pedestrian friendly one of the top highlights was visiting the various districts including Chinatown Little India and Camp home glam [Music] hopping on a traditional bum booat offered a unique perspective of the city as we were able to learn more about his color for history on her guided [Music] tour one of the highlights was drinking Singapore slings at the Raffles hotel where the drink was invested paying 27 Singapore dollars allowed us to sip on this wonderful cocktail and throw peanuts on the [Music] [Music] floor Singapore is impressive by day but really shines at night many of the stand out landmarks have a completely different look when the sun goes down and the bright lights of the city emerge when it comes to street food Singapore ranks favorably with Korea Malaysia Taiwan and Thailand Hawker centers offered up a spread of Asian Delights that were heavy on Flavor while being light on our [Music] wallet in order to cover as much ground as possible we purchased a Hop On Hop off bus ticket to get around the city being able to get on and off whenever we wanted was a real bonus as it helped us preserve our walking life although we saw many of the most popular attractions such as merlon Marina Bay and the Fullerton Hotel it was the adventures we had wandering around that formed the greatest impressions of the city overall our time in Singapore was distinctly memorable hopefully we'll have a chance to come back again soon to explore more of this impressive 21st century city state [Music] so we are in Mala right now and it is night time so we are about to head over to joner Street where they have one of the biggest night markets I have ever seen it is a great place to find food and go shopping so let's head over there [Music] okay so what are you eating right now well nothing very to do at the night market the juner street Night Market than to indulge in street food and we've got a refresh in little dish right down here take a look at him different kinds of jellies and beans and shaved ice with sweet maybe some sweet coconut milk and cane syrup oh is ever good perfect way to beat the heat okay so right here we've ordered something that's called a carrot cake I am not seeing any carrot so far but it looks really tasty let's see what this is smells good m is it good mhm how would you describe it not car I would say it's like a pad thae without the noodles and you have the bean sprouts you have a little bit of tofu some egg peanuts awesome I don't know where the carrot name comes from [Music] so I just bought some sugar can juice it's really sweet and refreshing I love that they gave us lot of ice perfect perfect for a hot Night Like This come [Music] [Applause] your [Applause] the other side not you talk to I tell you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we boarded a river taxi one of our favorite ways of getting around Bangkok to visit one of the most iconic landmarks of the entire [Music] city today is one of our last days in Thailand and actually one of our last days in Southeast Asia so we've decided to do a bit of sightseeing around on Bangkok and we are visiting watt AR this is the Temple of dawn located on the West Bank of the Chao PRI [Music] River already sweating profusely and now it's time to go climb this massive Temple I've seen water r a few times when traveling down the Chao pra River and it's really interesting because from a distance it just looks like it's a gr Temple maybe made out of concrete but once you actually get here and walk up close to it you can see all the intricate little details like it's made up of broken tiles and ceramic so it's really cool it's a bit of a surprise [Music] and it gets even [Music] steeper so that was easily the scariest set of stairs I have ever climbed the steps were like this high and they were only this wide so your feet could barely fit on there I had to come down seated the whole time like just on my butt some tips for visiting water run first make sure you bring tons of water like we brought two water bottles and we've just guzzled them I swear I've sweated out half of my body weight and second even though it's a really steep climb even if you're afraid of heights like I personally am still worth going up the views are [Music] amazing welcome to B Indonesia after spending nearly a year traveling in Southeast Asia we couldn't leave without first visiting Bali we decided to take a two-e trip to the famed Island and split our time between Ubud and S to explore as much as possible [Applause] during one of our first nights on the island we attended a banese fire and trance performance this dance and music drama originated in the 1930s depicting stories from Hindu [Music] literature ubba is the art and cultural capital of Valley and we enjoyed spending a few days here our mornings in the town were spent visiting the various temples browsing through markets and soaking in the surroundings [Music] we also had a chance to visit the talang rice teres they were lush green and reminded us of our time in Korea because Sam's apartment overlooked Rice Terraces [Music] Bali is mainly Hindu and the island is home to many temples during our time in Valle we visited the elephant Temple which is best known for its menacing cave entrance we also visited gunun kawi which is nicknamed The Rock Temple The Rock Temple gets its name because of the 10 shrines that were carved into the rock wall they stand 7 m tall and are a like to [Music] be well I'm supposed to sprinkle water on my head so here we [Music] go during our tour around the island we stopped at a lookout point where we saw the impressive Mount batur looming in the Horizon Mount batur is an active volcano however when we learned that it was open to hikers we decided we were up for the challenge Valley is a great jump off point for exploring some of the surrounding beaches and Islands trips to luk Nui lambangan and the Gilli islands are very easy to arrange there are plenty of water sports to choose from including snorkeling free diving scuba diving surfing and even kaying ubit is home to the monkey Forest where Infamous little Maco roam freely the monkey Forest is home to over 600 monkeys who over time have lost all fear of man the monkeys are not shy and will approach people and even climb onto their bodies they believe you have food if you're feeling adventurous and would like to feed the monkeys you can purchase bananas right at the entrance of the monkey Forest [Music] one of the highlights of our time in Bali was climbing Mount batur for Sunrise the morning of the hike we got up at 2: in the morning and we're driven to the base of the volcano armed with a trusty guide and flashlights in hand we began the steep climb that would take close to two hours to complete we took plenty of breaks along the way but once we finally reached the top we were rewarded with a rainbow colored sunrise [Music] overall we really enjoyed our time in Bali it may not have been the quiet Paradise that's depicted in the movies but it offered culture natural beauty and it was a great place to [Music] relax we are on a little raft just cruising down the Mong Delta loving the conical hat like your hat I'm loving the Hat I need a hat of my own come on we should be wearing this back in Canada what's wrong with [Music] people a little traffic jam over here hello hello hello hello [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we're doing a 3-day tour of the Mong Delta this is day number one and we just started off by sampling some tea with honey and a few little snacks and now we're doing a little paddle boat uh Adventure down the m [Music] the [Music] [Applause] [Music] so this is the hillside town of piie it's about 3 and 1/2 hours away from changmai and this is where we've been spending the weekend so we are staying at the pie Chan cottages and this is our private little Bungalow so let's go have a look inside hey hey hey come on in this is our little humble little room here see we got a nice big size bed mosquito net over here which fortunately this time of the year we haven't had to be using very often because it's freezing at night it's freezing so the likely the mosquitoes have all died but the best part about this place are the views check out [Music] this rice fields [Music] am I interrupting your nap you're just too cute and wrinkly look at [Music] that we've only got a few days left here in Thailand and I've been hearing from friends' been raving about pie for years and I've always put off coming here and this time I said there's no way we're going to leave Thailand without coming to pie and now I understand what all the fuss is about this place is wonderful it's one of the most relaxing towns I've ever visited and we're going to show you around and you're going to get to see firsthand why we love it here [Music] what you doing well I couldn't be any more relaxed in this hammock right now at this rate I don't even know if we'll get into the town [Music] one of the main reasons people come to pie is just to relax and totally chill out I mean a lot of other destinations you go to visit temples you go to do other types of things but here it's just enjoying the scenery wandering around swinging on a hammock those are the top things to do and I'm loving it so far so we seem to have found hippie Central just across the river there's a cool little bar called Sunset Bar and it can be reached via a bamboo Bridge shall we check it out [Music] that was awesome we crossed that rickety old bridge and then we came to some really cool looking guest houses and now we're here in the [Music] fields so one of the draws to is being able to explore the countryside and yesterday I rented my very first scooter it only cost me $3 a day and I got a helmet with that um and it was a great way to explore I mean I thought it was going to be kind of tricky riding it for the first time but it was a lot of fun well you did well didn't you and it opened up a lot of the surrounding areas that would have been tough to reach by foot aside from chilling out and relaxing in pie one of the few things that we actually really want to do is to take a trip over and visit the hot [Music] springs so we're here in pie visiting the hot springs this is the 35° pool and I'm swinging like tarzen well not exactly but I'd like to think that [Music] and that giant white Buddha over there is something I plan on visiting tomorrow morning when I wake up [Music] I I can't swing I need an assistant to swing me Sam come swing me I'm just kidding I'm kidding no Sam Sam no oh my God what are you doing okay I just want to get you on the hammock do you want to go flying no okay just go back on and say something you fetch me a drink [Music] today we are having a feast of a dinner we are at a Cambodian restaurant and we have just ordered ourselves an e horse meal this restaurant is called Anor Pond and it's come highly recommended so we have high expectations for this meal [Music] so right now I am trying the fresh spring rolls and I think they have rice noodles inside so see waa that's a mega bite that was a really good spring roll it had some very fresh and zesty flavors and a little bit of seafood as well so so far so good so next up we have the spare ribs and these do look good oh yeah just melts in your mouth so next up we are trying the amok which is one of the most popular dishes in Cambodia and amok is fish that has been coated in coconut cream and then baked in a banana so let's see how that [Music] tastes hit the spot M she takes a second bite before I get in mhm [Music] and this is the one thing that I'm probably almost most excited about the homemade green curry with chicken I've got a slice of [Music] chicken wow you can really taste the curry and once again just like the spare ribs it just melts in your mouth I barely even have to chew is it coconut based I don't think it's that strong strongly coconut base no so up next is our shaved mango salad which has some peanuts and mint leaves on top M sweet sir it is sweet it's also nice and crunchy because of the peanuts and it has some nice spices it's really flavorful you just took a second bite and last but certainly not least is the fried water spinach yeah that's tasty it's got kind of a buttery garlic flavor time for dessert tell us what you're having and to finish off we've got a sweet little treat a tap tapioca based pudding with banana ooh take a big bite oh my so sweet so good so we have finished our Feast of dinner I must admit when I first saw the platter being brought over I thought H this is for two people I think I could probably eat my own but in the end we still had food left over like that was just so much to eat it was so tasty but it was really feeling at the same time so good stuff good dinner so the8 course platter is $14 for two people and for those who want to come here this restaurant is located right in the heart of CM reap nearby the Central Market can't miss it [Music] today we are outside CM reap and we are exploring the temples of Anor starting with Anor Tom Most Fascinating thing about Bon are the cold faces that have a hint of a smile [Music] this massive complex has 54 towers with 216 faces on them [Music] n [Music] so over here we have the Terrace of the elephants it is 350 M long this was once used as a viewing platform from where you could watch the ceremonies that took place for the king well we're traveling right now in Cambodia April and it is the hottest time of the year here it's always hot in Cambodia but this is literally the worst month I'm just sweating bucket so a tip for people coming here if you want to come in a bit of a cooler time December January February great time to come it's also peak season here so you will be sharing it with more tourists but you won't be sweating as much [Music] waking up early in the morning certainly has his advantages we we are the first people to arrive at this Temple [Applause] bant this is one of the temples that we have been most excited to visit and we are officially the first ones here [Music] a [Music] [Music] [Music] so here we are inside the temple this happens to be a Hindu temple and it is dedicated to the god Shiva most of the temples of Anor were commissioned by powerful Kings but this temple in particular was not it was commissioned by a Brahman which makes it quite unique because we came here early we got a VIP tour normally these areas are gated off as you can see by the way weight perimeter here in the Rope look at where we are [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the advantages of being the first on site can't be underestimated I mean anything to avoid those package tourist is a good [Music] [Music] idea there are many temples to choose from but this one in particular bantis Ray is considered to be the crown jewel of anoran art because it has some of the most Exquisite and intricate carving this Temple is located very far away from CM re we had to travel over an hour in a Tuk Tuk and I slept most of the way but I hear it was a very Scenic Journey yes along the way we pass a lot of rural villages we saw locals out doing various kinds of activities early in the morning some farming related some business we saw bikes packed you know just to the total brim full of stuff we saw a lot of different things and it was just a really cool trip to get out here [Music] [Music] bright and early it's only 7:20 in the morning and I've been dragged out of bed by someone to go visit the Batu Caves early in the day and how are we getting there mhm we are taking the commuter train from chaos Cal one ring at each it was cheap [Music] today we are visiting the Batu Caves it's only 13 km north of koala lumur and this is an important Hindu shine the caves takes its name from the Batu River and is dedicated to Lord murugan looks like it's feeding time for the pigeons over here [Music] who said money or food couldn't buy you friends [Music] here I am on step number one I've only got 272 more of these bad boys to climb [Music] [Music] [Music] are lots of mots Little Monkeys and this is my first time seeing monkeys up close so it's all I'm taking pictures of forget the temple finally 272 steps later we have made it to the top [Music] he [Applause] so this is actually my third time coming to the batti caves but this is by far the earliest I've come and what a difference it makes there's hardly anyone here it feels like we have the place to ourselves we've had intimate encounters with pigeons monkeys boosters there's a performance going on my tip to anyone come early we beat the first tour bus Group here look at them I'm [Music] coming so now we're rewarding ourselves with the vegetarian Indian Feast I swear I must have lost half my water and body weight going up and down those fat [Music] caves so I ordered myself a delicious Roy which I'm going to enjoy right now I am starving oh [Music] well hello hello so we are up bright and early again it's probably about 700 in the morning and today we are doing a biking tour at CM [Music] Reef here we are at our first stop Temple garden and we were just politely kicked off of our bike so a good tip if you're taking your bike you cannot explore the temple garden with it you'll have to get off and walk [Music] so now we are along the banks of the CM Reef river which runs through the heart of the city and we are just going to be cycling the length of it so you can see a lot of things along the river there's a man over there fishing elephants they're just statues [Music] oh [Music] here we are biking along the river Sam of course is way ahead because he has giant legs oh there he is now that we've crossed the other side of the river we've gone from hotels and restaurants to more rural style Cambodian homes [Music] helloy hello hello puppy hi we've been biking past lots of little communities along the side of the river and the kids have been really friendly so far they keep running up to us and just waving hello and trying to chat chat with these foreigners so let's keep going [Music] this afternoon we are going to be visiting the golden Mount and together we will be taking public transportation namely Water Taxis when exploring Bangkok one of my favorite ways of getting getting around is hopping on a river taxi the system is very extensive [Music] [Music] so these taxi boats have blue tarps along the side that you have to lift up once the boat starts moving and that's because the river looks like that you would not want to fall in there or get any of that water in your mouth oh even smell it woo that's St here [Music] [Music] a [Music] [Music] tonight we are visiting the Sunday Night Market in changmai and right now we're at tap gate this is where the market starts and it runs 1 kilometer into the old city so we're going to be wandering around sampling some food and showing you what it's like over here on a Sunday [Music] so you can buy a lot of handicrafts here at this market for example silks scarves uh wood carvings you can get some paintings they have ceramics silverware lots of jewelry I mean you can browse here for hours on end and trinkets Galore [Music] you get tired walking around in the Night Market you can just head over here sit down relax and get a nice tie for Lun 30 minutes for $2 right probably it's 80 B for the foot massage you can get a cheaper one at the changm park like you're getting way one spring roll one eggplat tempura one oh yes one well you sure loaded up with some tasty treats okay so this is my second dinner I have some deep fried tempura eggplant with sweet and sour sauce on top and fresh spring rolls with carrots and cilantro maybe and some noodles hey try one of them [Applause] okay and that would be it taste very healthy the fresh row it's [Music] good it's not as flavorful as I would have hoped here have a look it's it's actually bean sprouts not noodles I was wrong bean sprouts and tofu and some carrots what's this over here well I must have been a monkey in a past life because whenever I get a chance to try a banana I'm always in there and this is the deep fried version so it's already kind of smooshed up here awesome does it have some kind of special sauce over top no there's no special sauce it's just deep fried and the banana is really mushy and moist in the inside okay this is my tempura eggplant thank okay that tastes a lot better it's almost like a french fry can I say that yep it has a nice sweet and sour sauce over top it's it's very oily um but that means it's very flavorful French friy a stick [Music] and that concludes our visit to the hectic Chang my Sunday Night Market [Music] today we are visiting a place that is an important part of georgetown's Heritage the clan Jetties these are the last bastions of old Chinese settlements [Music] [Music] [Music] one of the things that has surprised me most about visiting the clan jety is that people live here with their pets so even though their houses are on stilts above the water they still keep dogs cats and it works and here we found some friendly little doggies yes leave it to me to find puppies cat it's purring cat let's steal you let's take you home yes you can fit in my [Applause] backpack well we've encountered a lot of friendly cats and dogs but not this one [Music] all of the houses in this area are built on stilts over the water and they even have a temple and here's a temple on stilts that we were looking to find [Music] this area is now part of the Heritage Trail and it was established roughly 150 years ago so there are several distinct Jetties along this area in fact there were seven at one time one just burnt down and now we are visiting The Chew jetti Is Us [Music] [Music] so how are we feeling feeling good just resting on someone's porch I imagine the stilt Villages here actually remind me quite a bit of the ones I visited while in brunai which were called the campong A and those were even quite a bit bigger but these are still very fascinating in the back of one of these Jetties there's the most random Santa Claus poster in the back [Music] so here we are visiting a market again that can only mean one thing we are taking a cooking course yet again today we are going to be learning how to make La food and our first stop is the fousy market it's the biggest Market in luang kabang and apparently it opens up 4:00 in the morning [Music] for our cooking class today it's awesome surprise we've got this Lush Garden setting it feels like we're just walking into someone's [Music] backyard almost inlaws cook is wife and daughter cook forever not husband and son family this is culture we don't put much sugar love cooking like Thai food you you taste St food taste milky creamy sweety because they add lots of coconut milk lots of sugar that's why the food tastes like that L food when you eat taste lots of herb lots of texure this is love food is not mean Tha food not tasty Tha food very tasty but we are taste different too [Music] pounding peppers and shallot and that's it time to try your tomato dip I made mine really spicy accidentally I thought we were cooking this so you're making your little yeah make a little ball with the rice medum it in here I don't want tast PL I just one how is it has a real cake SAR but it's so good has lemon juice hot peppers garlic I like that so I'd like to point out the Samar are making the exact same dish this is his sauce this is mine what are you missing just about everything all right so we're making the mkp fish and you are going to show us how to wrap it [Music] put wow what a work of art Audrey amazing be quiet it's going to taste amazing so we're cooking our buffalo meat now so here we have our buffalo salad so we we stir fried some buffalo meat and we also added bean sprouts there's banana flowers we have string beans hot chilies and mint leaves so we're going to be rolling this up in lettuce leaves it's kind of like a little fresh [Music] roll this morning we are venturing up to DOI suep and there's a temple at top of the mountain over overlooking shangai so we're going to be taking a red song tow to get there and hopefully the view of the city will be amazing here's the song tow crew say hi hi we're going to Jo [Applause] theft yeah build up of lactic acid [Music] get out of the vehicle and this is our first vantage point unfortunately it's still a bit hazy outside so we don't have a great View at the moment but the city is there [Music] somewhere so the long climb begins I'm not entirely sure how many steps we have to go but I know it's going to be a long way I think there's over 300 [Music] [Music] Pi up new one [Music] [Applause] [Music] so ideally you should be able to see the views of changmai from up here but today it's just really hazy so there's a cloud hanging over the city we can't really see much which is unfortunate [Music] [Music] so that concludes our visit to do suep it's definitely different than what I expected I was kind of expecting this quaint little temple on top of a hill and instead it's an extremely popular tourist attraction it's really crowded over here I would say the exterior of do theep is quite similar to a lot of the other Watts we have visited here in Shang however the Highlight for me was actually going inside the temple because there's a courtyard with a golden stupa and you can walk around like candles there's incense burning so that was a nicer experience [Music] it is lunchtime here in Mala so we're about to go to a babona type of restaurant which is a mix of Chinese and Malaysian Cuisine and this is a real hole in the wall kind of place it is [Music] I'm going to be showing you the monia laxa which is a spicy curry mixture of malet and Chinese element sauce take a look here it is coconut based curry soup and it has Cur Puffs fish sticks shrimp clams added to it very flavorful so what I'm having next is called rojack that's the the Malay word for mixture it's a refreshing salad yes so take a look over here and it's made using fruits and vegetables so it has pineapple cucumbers bean sprouts it's just a really nice refreshing salad in a hot day oh yeah oh yeah the last of our four dishes is called papaya it is a spring roll has an outside like a crepe and I'll show you the ingredients here it is has a sweet bean and soy sauce often has turnips bean sprouts sort of omelette type carrots lettuce tofu peanuts on top it's got everything going on take a bite glassy when the lime juice is here beat the heat we have some lime juice is that refreshing mhm [Music] [Applause] [Music] so what's been your favorite dish so far I've actually liked this one here the Bonia dumpling oh I've never had this one before I've tried the others but this is my first time okay take a big bite and tell us why you like it all right if I can struggling struggling well what I really like about the glue in this rice is a really unique kind of like coating for the dumpl also it's quite sweet inside hard to go wrong with sweet Foods when it comes to me and my taste part and what is Miss Al's favorite well I've really enjoyed the rice dumpling as well but I think my absolute favorite has been this salad over here I haven't eaten fresh fruits and vegetables in almost a year because in Korea they cost a fortune so I'm in heaven right now I'm just eating on what you got right now this pineapple which one yeah this is a pineapple nice sweet treat and the coating on the salad is delicious as well it's a sweet sauce with peanuts on top so it's just perfect so for the next two days we are doing a tour of how long bay so here we are aboard our ship our lovely home at Sea so we're going to give you a tour of the place [Music] lounging on the deck how are you enjoying the views you're okay [Music] so we've been doing lots of activities while we've been at howong Bay there's been kaying and exploring caves and this morning we're spending a bit of time at a private [Music] beach okay so Sam you are revisiting how long bay for the second time yes indeed I am okay so tell us what's been your favorite part this time around and how has it changed well it actually hasn't changed too much this tour is quite similar to the one I did before uh previously I did a 3-day tour this time we're doing a 2day 2 days I think is plenty we've done a lot of different fun activities I've just enjoyed being on the boat all the gorgeous scenery the mountains the cars Mountain well this has been my first time to how long bay so obviously what has impressed me the most is the scenery because it just looks out of this world it's unlike anything I've ever seen before so I've really enjoyed just hanging out on the top deck reading a book checking out the views and also the Fooda board has been really nice [Music] and next we're going to show you our room on the boat so hello hello Cabin [Music] Fever okay we've been here maybe half an hour it's already messy hey I blame it on this person no this person [Music] here we are just biking through the streets of hoan hello so here we have our little ticket for sightseeing around hoyan and the way it works is that you pay $6 and you get a ticket that grants you access into five different historic sites around town and you just show up at the entrance they snip off one of these little tabs and that's it works you're good to go here we are at the Japanese cover bridge it was built in 1593 so construction on this bridge began on the year of the monkey and it finished on the Year of the Dog and for that reason one side of the bridge is guarded by a monkey and the other by a dog [Music] [Music] we are at the most popular pedestrian bridge in town heading here to small square and this is where a lot of fabulous performances take place especially at nighttime [Music] here we at Quang trueu Assembly Hall it's a place of worship for the Cantonese community [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] a n [Music] [Applause] [Music] up next we are visiting the Assembly Hall of the Fuji and Chinese this place now acts as a temple to the goddess tinha who is from The fujian Province in China oh [Music] we are at our new favorite restaurant in Georgetown it's called citan restaurant capan and they serve up amazing Indian food if you like Rich Savory curries and buttery knots ohoh have you come to the right place [Music] so over here we have a tany set which I got and it came with a buttery na bread and some nice curries and we also have alobi over here with potatoes and cauliflower and some extra na because we just like it so much we need double portion that chicken is superb juicy in the inside crispy on the outside and wow what flavor the house the cry so good so good so so good [Music] aside from being a great restaurant in terms of the quality of food the other thing we really like about coming here is that it's so affordable you can just pick a whole bunch of different dishes mix and match and you'll get a great meal so one of our absolute favorite dishes so far has been the FL paner which is really delicious and you've also really enjoyed the tandur chicken which is always fresh crispy and the butter da that's good this is a 24-hour restaurant and we like it so much we're considering coming for breakfast lunch dinner maybe even a snack [Music] kaying Around The [Music] [Music] Bay we are paddling down the palong bay oh yeah look at you paddle I know I'm doing all the work and Sam's just there for the ride exactly you paddle girl you go [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so one of the coolest things out here by far are the floating villages [Music] survived our kaying experience in how long bay almost crashed into the cliff yes it was kind of scary it's a bit stressful especially because whenever the big boats the junks go past they create these little waves and like kayak and you have to get out of the way of the junk too that's if it's stressful yeah but it was fun it was a fun way to see the day so today we are having lunch at a little place called The Peppermint Cafe this is in some little back alley in changai and we're sitting outside just right by the street and we're going to enjoy some more Northern Thai food and you know how much we like our back alley restaurants [Music] we're here for Original Thai food and good shakes looks like you got just that M so today we are having a dish that is called cow soy and if you just look down over here you can see that it kind of looks like a curry type soup and we have regular boiled noodles some crispy noodles and chicken over top so this is a burmes influence dish from northern Thailand and it literally means cut rice this is one of Northern Thailand's most famous dishes [Music] so I've had this dish once before and I think my favorite part is the combination of the soft egg noodles mixed in with the crispy ones it's just a nice crunchy soft texture and the curry sauce gives it a bit of an extra kick so here we [Music] go I love coconut based curries and this is quite similar to masaman Curry [Music] this is a really popular street food in Northern Thailand but it's actually quite hard to find overseas and Thai restaurants so that means you have to come to Northern Thailand and try it for yourself empty plate over here sign of a good meal overall that meal was delicious and coming in at just 59 bot per dish what [Music] value I'm going to start off by saying that I was tricked into coming here I was told it was going to be a short oh it's a 10minute walk from Chinatown we're right around the corner and we've been walking for 45 minutes in C and then uphill I I'm covered in sweat and a bird just flew by me so we're at kale bird park the largest walk-in Avary in the world and that means the birds can fly freely around the park [Music] this Aviary is home to over 3,000 birds in more than 200 species and so far far we have seen love birds flamingos peacocks and birds that we don't even know what they [Music] are so this over here is the feeding area and as you can see the birds get a really nice diet of papayas and bananas [Music] this feels like Jurassic Park with birds instead of dinosaurs so I'm going to choose two birds and to with them wish we l so this is the selection you've got how about that you friendly yes having fun so we can feed Lori for like two ring which is about you know 70 cents so why not [Music] so Sam tell us about your new friends here who are they got four little friends and we're having a feeding party right now h [Music] e [Music] [Music] overall this was a really fun experience although it's not the cheapest thing to do in kale it's something we both highly recommend and wear bug spray so today we are setting out on a two-day hike through sappa and we are just walking through the town we've picked up a few more people who are joining us and we've already picked up some some local buddies who will be walking with us it seems what's your name [Music] today's hike is going to be divided into three sections and the first Village that we will be visiting is called Lao chai that's about 8 km from where we started out and we're 2 km into the truck so far it's getting really hot and I'm sweaty so let's keep going tell us about the scenery scenery here is stunning unbelievable everywhere we [Music] [Applause] [Music] walk so as you can see over here there's been a bit of a landslide that's blocking the road into the [Applause] town it's like [Music] a [Music] [Music] I thought I heard a waterfall down there it turns out it's just a river still impressive so after several kilometers of hiking we're finally approaching the village of Lao chai down below so we are about to cross this bridge into town and it is not for those who have vertigo because there are no railings on this bridge [Music] [Music] after 2 hours of hiking we've reached our first destination Point L Thai Village and it's time for lunch and I'm pretty hungry how about you I am starving I can't wait to get there fast enough it's just over there where the bridge is that's L chai [Music] for lunch today we are eating at one of our favorite restaurants in luang prang it's called Tamarind and it focuses on Lao Foods we're going to be showing you some traditional dishes so this over here is called num Mam and it's a Tamarind cooler you get a nice little bamboo straw and it's a really sweet and sour drink it's refreshing but a little tart I really like it [Music] so next up we have our dipping platter so this over here is a coriander pickle next we have an eggplant dip tomato dip we have a paste made from buffalo skin we have some seaweed chips and then some vegetables that we can use with the sauce so let's dig in and that all goes together of course with our sticky rice o so Sam is going to demonstrate for us this is how you eat it you just kind of put together a little balll like that and then you can pick a different dip I'll try the buffalo sauce here put it together just like that pop it in your mouth delicious is it a bit spicy oh yeah this one's really spicy actually finger food finger food yes that's a huge ball little ball that's not little okay and I will go with the [Music] oine slamed it down didn't worry she's got her happy face on so good it's not just oine they' added spices there's coriander there's an it's just an explosion of flowers so this is the second plate we've ordered again here we have a vegetable pickle this is a pork salad that also has banana flowers we have a pork sausage here's some Buffalo jerky Sam's favorite oh yeah and over here we have some little lettuce rolls that are stuffed with different dips different sauces so we'll be trying those okay Buffalo jerky to brok off a little piece of this Buffalo jerky this is my favorite chewy right yeah it's very chewy like any kind of jerky but this is probably the sweetest jerky I've ever had I can't remember ever tasting anything quite this sweet and jerky form so I'm going to try this leafy roll over here I taste lemongrass something sweet like a yam almost but I'm really not sure what it is it could be some local thing we've ordered so much food we almost forgot about this next dish but it's time for me to do the honors I'm going to unveil our steamed fish which comes wrapped in a banana leaf and it's called WPA look at that let's see what's in here it's like opening a present I know it's like Christmas on a plate oh wow there it is see the steam coming off the it's going to be good and it comes with a side of vegetables so let's not forget about those here are those here we go all right time for the first bite so this is cooked in Adil and basil sauce just melts in your mouth it is so soft and so flavorful it's [Music] delicious now for dessert we are having something that's called cow gam and it's purple sticky rice that has been cooked in coconut milk and it also has banana and sesame seeds on top so look down here it looks amazing uh and if that weren't enough we get a little shot of Tamarind sauce which we can pour over top so I'm going to try it the natural way without the Tamarind sauce first see so [Music] fragrant nice and sweet very sweet you can definitely taste the coconut and it's a nice sticky rice with a bit of a Nutty texture I like it all right let's try this with some tamaron sauce and a big chunk of [Music] banana oh lot so good Tamarind gives it a a k bit of spice still really sweet so that Splendid Feast came to just over $18 151,000 Kip which we think was excellent value it's a bit of a gourmet type of restaurant and it's right by the river you've got awesome views from here pap [Music] it's the second day of our Mong Delta tour we're going to visit some traditional floating markets out here and we're rocking the colorful hats [Music] want to B now [Music] one 10 how to know hey [Music] we just finished a very hot and sweaty ride through a floating Market there were small little vessels selling things like fresh fruit and ice cold coffee so we sat there enjoyed the scenery and ate some food they literally had the perfect strategy down they just had us sitting there for like 15 20 minutes we were sweating profusely and they were selling us cold drinks they must have made a fortune [Music] so today we are back at our favorite Thai restaurant but we are going to be having a special meal we have ordered a set for two people that focuses on Northern Thai Dishes so we are going to get a sampling of different curries that come along with sticky rice and this is what it might look like our first dish has arrived and it's called cow soy and it is fried noodles on top of a hearty Curry ooh that looks amazing does m let's dig into that baby [Music] going to try my first fried noodle fried noodle I've never had anything like this H it's kind of nice ooh and the curry is kind of spicy how's that a very flavorful spicy curry I can tell it's made out of some coconut milk it's not a very thick Curry it's more stew like and soupy but it's really nice on a warm day like this I'm enjoying it [Music] ooh sticky rice inside so a lot of the northern Thai Dishes have pork in them so as you can see over here we've got a pork sausage we have something that looks like ground pork with some nice green herbs and this might also be pork if you ask me one of the characteristic elements of Northern Thai food is that you eat your side dishes with sticky rice oo this is going to be [Music] tasty so I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be using my hands or not but since it's sticky rice I am we're going to dip it over here let's see how it tastes Spicy Sweet this one is surprisingly sweet so I'm going to try one of these little Puffs and another kind of diing sausage M that looks like it could be spicy yeah yeah it is burning your mouth so we also have a nice pumpkin stew over here tofu with tofu spicy not spicy just really hot okay what's next so next up in the dishes to try here would be the ground park looks like it's been marinated in nice little sauce [Music] very strong flavor with the sauce it's like looks like soy sauce but that's hard going down very tasty though so it's only our first week in changai in Northern Thailand but we are quickly discovering that this part of the country has a lot to offer in the cooking Department normally when you think Thai food you think oh Pad Thai green curries but really there is so much here and like today we had dishes that we've never even heard of before and they were so tasty so and we still don't even know exactly what they are yes we don't know the names I'm sure we will learn them over the course of our time here but for now what we can tell you is Northern Thai food is really tasty so just when we thought the meal was finally over we are so stuffed they bring dessert out for us and it is amazing so here you can see bananas it's just slices of bananas in a sweet thick coconut cream and it's amazing really oh yeah need to try it I want to see your face when you bite into that wow it almost has a bit of a rum caramel type flavor which really accentuates the coconut milk that was seriously the Feast of Feasts he paid 300 bot in total for that which is roughly $10 us and it was worth every penny or should I say every [Music] bot tress towers are brilliant by day but wow do they ever shine at night [Music] black [Music] okay so this is now our third time coming to the Patronis towers and having seen it during the day and at night I have to say I prefer it at night a lot more they have really cool light show that takes place there's also a lot more people who come to watch the show [Music] n [Music] there you have it the petronis towers at night a sight to [Music] behold today we are standing in front of Malaysia's most iconic building the petronus towers there are lots of different Vantage points around the park so that you can get your shot with the petronis towers and this is one of them the petronis towers took six years to build and they were the tallest building in Asia until taipe 101 took them over and I've been to taipe 101 and these are more impressive so these towers were designed by an Argentinian architect named Caesar P represent represent because why where oh because I grew up in Argentina there you go the double decker skybridge here connects the two towers together it's quite awesome so my question is is this a water fountain or can I actually go swimming in there [Music] [Music] n [Music] he [Music] [Music] so now we are at another Temple called pracon which means sacred sword and this Temple is believed to have been a university that housed over a thousand [Music] teachers this here is one of our favorite temples the reason why we really like it so much is that it's just not overcrowded like we've come here mind you we've come early in the morning but there's hardly anyone here and it has that kind of eerie feel to it similar to top prom but without all the crowds so you can be walking through and you feel like you're going through a maze it's really quite fascinating n [Music] [Music] n [Music] so people who have come through this Temple have picked up some rocks and stacked them into a little formation and I do believe this has a special meaning in Buddhism [Music] one of the top things to do when you're visiting Georgetown is to take a Rick Shaw tour and that's exactly what we're going to do this is our colorful little ride right herey what's your name p har nice to meet you bye we're going on a rick shot ride [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we got some m big waves coming here oh so we got soaked by a massive wave we sure did and it's actually kind of refreshing now so I'm kind of happy at and our camera survived it so not too bad actually [Music] the big cat and the little mouse this is PR cute so this is a Chinese temple yeah Chinese very old Temple oh wow 100 years [Music] old so a tour around historic Georgetown will reveal some crumbling Colonial architecture as Audrey likes to say no I do [Music] so over here is St George Church come here black oh before the British come here the governor British governor use the car oh that's the old Governor's car where are you so this is the old train that used to travel up panang Hill carrying passengers up bamboo ship a bamboo ship wow this Cassie Mustafa one of our favorite restaurants in Georgetown to get Roy and it is noticeable for its bright green and yellow [Music] [Music] paint e [Music] [Music] [Music] and final stop our hotel [Music] so today we are having dinner at a great little restaurant it's located right across from the Paya bus terminal in koala for and it's Indian food my favorite nothing like refreshing food drinks to start your meal here o nice a banana [Music] what we are having today is called Roti chai and it is an Indian flatbread I got one that has cheese inside I'm going to dip it in the curry sauce and the Roy chai is actually the Malaysian form of oh yeah what we're having here is Ro chai Roti means bread in Hindi and Mal chai and Mal means to roll of how do you roll it out show us nice it's fed with fat eggs flour water and in special cases where there's special ingredients like this one right here Sam's feeling a little shy because there's people watching him eat right now is it the freckles is it the t-shirt is it because he's using his hand what could it be [Music] there are two ways to eat Roy 10 I my hand or by utensil and believe me I will not give up an opportunity to use my hand demonstrate for us wait mix it up good e that's sloy you just wiped it on your pants no I did and Audrey here will be having it using utensils well I on the other hand am eating like a lady and using a fork and spoon keeping it classy [Music] so Rosie chai is thinner than the Indian style non which a lot of people are familiar with it's thin in the same way as a chapati for example so you can get plain Roy or you can get a little fancier with your order they have banana Ro garlic Roy cheese Roy egg as well egg Roy yes I had that earlier lots of cheese from one of the coolest things when you come here to the restaurant is the little book you get you just keep toweling it up here on the side and eventually when you're finished feasting they finally give you your to so this

me denti milk has copious amounts of sugar [Music] big ice from back yeah okay aside from the ice cap I think we need to discuss Sam's new look over here pretty obvious change right what what is that what that mustache awesome you love it throwback from [Music] so there are two different cost is in this train we are traveling in the soft seat section which has AC and really cushy chairs then you also have hard benches with band yeah big difference I'm glad we got these ones a lot more comfortable [Music] w [Music] we be having chicken one of my favorite snacks of all fried Springs and I get to eat them on the train [Music] so today we are doing something that I've been wanting to do ever since we got to hoan and that is shopping there are said to be over 200 different tailor just in hoana this is a city where you come to have your clothes custom made you can get dresses shirts suits shoes purses anything made and they can copy the latest designs you just have to show them a magazine with what you want and they'll recreate it for you shopping for clothes especially dresses this is not my realm of [Music] expertise hi shopping come here here here [Music] hold having fun changing over there um having trouble putting into my dress ooh looks nice you like it yeah it feels like the a little smaller number two and how do you like this one grey nice my color I like this it's got the flowers is nice I like it yeah I can do a little smaller yeah a little smaller in the back so you can make smaller yeah I [Music] good side for you you like it I do yes you like all three of them uh we stay here two more days two more days yes so what are we having done right now getting my dresses made so that they fit me properly where you going now after here we go to Hanoi oh Hanoi Hanoi very far away so we're just waiting here for Audrey's dresses to get some minor alterations done on them I think too big they were a little too big on me but I'm so excited for them to be so I'm quite pleased with my purchases I ended up getting three dresses and I probably could have gotten more cuz lady just kept pushing me try this one try that one and she really wanted you get that fourth dress oh yeah but we had to cut it off at three so overall we paid $18 per dress plus a slight discount and that included alterations and everything so a little tip for anyone who's thinking of going shopping in Haan I would say just walk around the different streets see what the shops have to offer see what styles you like and then go into a store and don't be afraid to bargain a little and ask for different patterns different Fab bricks they can make anything want so the journey to Lao is actually a 3-day trip day one involves driving from Chang maai to Chang Kong which is at the border between lao and Thailand then day two we finally get on the boat and we travel from Chang Kong cross the border and arrive in PAC bent and the last day the third day it's 9 hours on a boat all the way from Pac bent to luang pron we're going to tell you all about our journey the pros the cons the things that are great what was wasn't so great first this is the actual trip [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so overall conclusions about this trip we definitely recommend taking the slowboat from Thailand to Lao however doing a 3-day tour is something we would definitely reconsider so perhaps a lot of our negatives come from the fact that we did a budget tour and we took the option that was only 2400 bought so some of the things we didn't like so much was that we were always leaving behind schedule sometimes we would be waiting around for an hour before anything happened also when it came to accommodations the hotels weren't amazing our first night was spent at a former jail and it kind of felt a bit Spartan there was no hot water so we couldn't shower in terms of food I would call it prison food it was boiled cabbage and just overcooked rice so those were some of the cons I think you're being a little bit too kind with your description of the hotel it's literally the hardest bed I've ever slept on I would have been more comfortable on a rock so if I had to do this trip over again I would definitely do it independently you can take a bus from Chang ma or other Northern Thai cities all the way to the Border cross it yourself find your own accommodations find something that's a little bit better more suitable than what we stayed at also you can buy your own boat tickets as well and by showing up early at the pier and purchasing it yourself that ensures you get a good seat and that's the key to enjoying your experience going down the makong so a few tips to make the trip a bit more pleasant would be show up early you want to be the first person on the boat so you can choose the best seats you don't want to be near the front because the views aren't that great and you're kind of sitting sideways and you don't want to be near the back because the engine is rambling and it's incredibly loud you want to choose a seat in the middle also you'll want to bring a cushion or a pillow just in case you end up seating on the wooden seats those are not very comfortable and you'll also want to stock up on lots of food bring sandwiches pastries whatever it is you'll want to eat because it's a long trip and on the boat they just have chips and tea and noodles in a cup so Hawker centers which are open a food stall complexes serve up a variety of inexpensive food from Chinese to Indian and Malaysian to Indonesian there is a diverse ction of Cuisine to choose from we're having our first lunch here in Singapore at a hawker Center and I've ordered myself some Chinese food I have some H chicken rice which looks absolutely delicious I've got a butter chicken with butter knot right down here so here is my dish it's just a bit of plain rice and some chicken with crispy skin on the outside and despite it looking a bit Bland it's actually quite tasty it's hard not to enjoy butter chicken this is [Music] awesome we got a few more snacks to complete the meal what are they so this is a combination of Sate and dimsum so we have sweet potato here this one is yam we've got tofu cubes over here this one is prawn and I believe that is a shrimp dumpling so I'm going for something a little sweet here I have some kind of yam spring roll should I dip it in peanut sauce no just have it is it sweet it is it tastes like a sweet potato except it's white so this crab didn't go on a skew and it will taste good in the peanut sauce I'm pretty sure mix that around mix that bad boy around W what's happening over there kind of chewy here's the crab W nice cloth oh that's delicious and it's so juicy inside M so as buzz it Travelers these Hawker centers in Singapore are real fine because it is really expensive in Singapore it's one of the most expensive cities in all of Asia certainly the most expensive in Southeast Asia and you can find dishes here for between you know 4 to 10 Singaporean dollars and so much cheaper than eating in a restaurant and I like the variety that you find in the Hawker centers for example today we had some Indian food Chinese food and we also saw St selling Malaysian food Singaporean dishes and lots of other things this Hawker Center is by the Singapore Flyer but you can find them all throughout the city hello hello hello hello hello we are now visiting Tapo which is a Buddhist temple where the jungle just dominates the architecture here the buildings are wrapped in trees some of the entrances are blocked and Indiana Jones would feel right at home here at this temple in fact it was used for the set of two Mo Raider starring Angelina Jolie it's decaying it's crumbling but it's a great place to explore this is an example of nature taking over the temple here you have this massive tree that's just straddling a wall really some parts of the temple have been completely destroyed over the centuries which actually creates quite a fascinating atmosphere I first visited to ROM back in 2008 and wow was it an entirely different experience there was hardly anyone I was able to walk around without you know encountering Mass crowds it's completely different this time instead of sort of lamenting about it and you know just getting really negative and down about it what I've been actually doing is just taking a lot of time lapse shots I'm using the crowds and the people as sort of a you know backdrop for filming and that's what I'm going to do throughout this entire time that I'm here exploring the temples of ancore [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he a much quieter alternative once you've explored the temple is actually just to walk around the perimeter it's quite peaceful here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you know we love to eat so today we have signed up for a cooking course where we're going to learn how to make some of our favorite Thai Dishes right now we're at the local market so we're just going to be walking around picking out some of the ingredients we'll need today for the class and yeah let's have a look judging from the amount of cooking videos we make you'd probably think that we're constantly in the kitchen that we always like to cook that could be further from the truth most of the time when we're on the road we eat out so this is actually kind of an excuse to get into the kitchen to cook to actually try to make food because normally we don't do [Music] that we have now arrived at the Thai Farm cooking school so we drove about 17 km outside of changmai and it's a completely different world out here we're just surrounded by nature and an organic farm and we're actually going to be picking a lot of the vegetables from here with a choice between doing a cooking course in the city or going out to the countryside and I think we've made the right decision now C already [Music] pleas come inside no I would like you to pick by yourself the holy B making my yellow curry p p p p p p p p p so Sam's lagging a little behind right oh come on Master Chef here look at that Perfection no I really have legging behind I better hustle okay so I'm making a yellow curry today so this is mine this is what I created and Sam went for the green curry so this is his and I'd like to point out I don't think he did a very good job oh that just fell that just fell in there what's this whatever whole chunks F you get an F all right it's boiling it's not supposed to boil so we're making the tomyam soup mine is going to have shrimp and I got my coconut milk here so I'm going to be adding some ingredients mushroom so ready to try my fine creation this is my tomyam shrimp I made mine really sweet I think maybe I put in too much sugar but it's kind of nice it's it's creamy so I use coconut as a base you need to add more salt or fish sauce then mine does need more salt how's yours you look like a farmer drinking soup keeping this out swear no mine I'm quite happy with mine I put quite a bit of salt in it and I also put F sauce taking my yellow curry now just stirring the coconut milk so I put in my the curry paste I made earlier there's also some pumpkin and potatoes and I accidentally added some leaves that I wasn't supposed to but she [Music] so now that we've chopped everything up we're going to be throwing this into the walk and making our stir fried [Music] rice I was wrong about this dish it's not a stir fried rice it's just a vegetable stir fry um tting really good I made one with chicken and string beans and mushrooms and here is my yellow curry with potatoes and pumpkin is it good mhm so at this point in the day I'm getting completely stuffed i' actually wouldn't mind taking a siesta right now but we're going to be making two more dishes I am going to be making a pad tie and then a mango sticky rice so suffering from what my family calls bulbous plump itude so making pad tie your favorite and here is my pad tie probably one of the easier tie dishes you can make so we saved the very best for last here we have our favorite tie dessert mango sticky rice and it has some um I think deep fried mung bean on top it's crispy this is going to be good all right let's check out that first bite it's nice and coconuty it's amazing so overall that was a really cool experience learning how to cook Thai food I made five different dishes I'm beyond full like I feel like I'm ready to hdate now so this was 1100 bought it's like lunch and dinner and the thing I really liked about this particular school was that it was out in the Countryside we're able to get out of the city away from the pollution and whatnot and just have a really cool organic cooking experience today we're in Saigon one of the most hectic and chaotic cities in Southeast Asia and we're going to show you the main attractions and the best souvenir to take back home weasel coffee so that's coffee that's been pooped out of a weasel in case you were wondering looks a little bit like an oh Henry bar so there's a lot of exotic things you can buy in Vietnam nothing more so than snake wine snake wine here we go we also have some very cool chocolates over here in the shape of conical hats or you can get your own Duan Duan choc tasty our first stop today is the war remnants Museum in Saigon this Museum Chronicles the war from the perspective of the north [Music] side so we just finished visiting the war remnants Museum and inside it's divided into several galleries I would say that the most impacting Gallery is the one that focuses on the results of Agent Orange and the Agents orange was a defoliant used to get rid of the leaves in the jungle so that it would make Warfare easier but the thing is that the toxins affected people decades later so someone who had been exposed to the toxins when they were 12 years old when they had children at 25 most of those kids were born with deformities and like thousands of people in Vietnam are affected by this [Music] we're here at tinh how Temple dedicated to the goddess of the sea so many years ago this is where people would have come to pray for protection before a long sea Journey over here they're burning the used incense sticks [Music] so the spiral cones that you see burning up there are actually incense sticks and they burn for 3 months so if a family wants to have good luck they come to the temple they write their name and their date of birth on a little ribbon and that's attached to the incense stick and it just burns there for 3 months and you're lucky the whole time next up it's time to go shopping at the bint Market let's see what we can findy Market is a bustling Hive of activity you can buy just about anything here you look I for [Music] you we have some very forceful sales women over here one lady Gra to my arm and I was pulling and she would not let go of me cuz I wouldn't buy a Sil scar [Music] we are now visiting the reunification Palace this used to be the presidential Palace for South Vietnam and it is stuck in a Time Warp it has been left to look exactly the way it did when the north stormed through on April 1975 [Music] this is the notra dam cathedral in Saigon and it's a very easy Landmark to notice because it's made out of red brick and if you happen to be here at the right time you can even join mass and our last stop of the day we are visiting the general post office in Saigon and normally a post office wouldn't be a main attraction but this one was designed by Gustav AEL the same guy who built the Eiffel Tower the old phone booths have been turned into ATM machine stations [Music] although it is a main tourist attraction it still does function as a post office and that concludes our grand tour of Saigon we hope you enjoyed [Music] it sir looking Happy on the train train to Bangkok so right now we are in the dining carriage and as you can see there is no AC so the windows are open and the fans are blowing but I am still sweating rusly [Music] oh I [Music] [Music] [Music] a heart are you dreaming about cats or hamsters cats not if it's cats yes I dreaming about cats so the first travel agent we went to in changai told us there were no seats left on the train but look at this we are on a train no one's up there and we are going to Bangkok on the train that is very full not so basically what happened is we went to this really shady travel agent the first time and what they wanted to do was sell us bus ticket really really overpriced bus ticket normally a bus ticket is only 400 bot from changai to Bangkok but they were trying to sell it to us for 750 bucks they said no trains only five seats left on the bus yeah right this will be my first time going to Bangkok last time I was there it was just in transit so I hadn't seen any of the city and that's it for now I think yeah today we are biking out to trackway it's a little village we're going for a special organic meal at a restaurant that grows its own vegetables and herbs [Music] oh oh wow you hear the th oh yeah yeah yeah the S on the water water wheel water wheel you're natural fun I don't know what is you should move out here and take up farming so this place is amazing it's like a little organic Oasis where they just grow different herbs and vegetables everyone is farming it's so peaceful and quiet and it's beautiful like look at all the flowers around us so we have a very special drink here it's called the water wheel drink lemon basil seed and ginger M let's take a sip of that tastes very healthy in a good way or a bad way in a pretty good way okay [Music] traay is a small farming Community Village located 2 kilm Northeast of the ancient hoan town area so we've just come here for dinner but if you decide to visit this Village you can also work with the farmers for the day you can take a rice paper making class or you can take a cooking class so if you've been following along with our recent food videos you probably noticed we've been having these pancakes a lot and they are delicious I have to say that the presentation of these ones down here these look the best so these here are the best country pancakes we've had what I really like about them is they're not as oily or greasy as the other ones they have a little bit of a fluffier [Music] [Music] texture so this lovely presented dish is called three friends and there are three friends right in my hand we have shrimp pork and vegetables wrapped around pop that in your mouth friendly some good pals in my mouth these T Amigos are almost too pretty to eat [Music] thank you thank [Music] you so here we have our colorful papaya salad and I didn't realize it was going to be this big I'm starting to think we ordered way too much food are you kidding me with me here too much food MH I'll take care of that well to sum up this meal I can honestly say this is the best dinner I've had since I've been in Vietnam absolutely love the dishes you could just taste the freshness in every single dish we had the prices are really affordable the portions were generous it was cooked really healthy nothing was greasy or too oily just absolute Delight to come here and eat I definitely agree I think the long bike ride out here was definitely worth it and it's nice eating in such a quiet peaceful setting just being surrounded by the Farms so highly recommend it if you're in Haan [Music] So today we're visiting vnn the capital of Lao and unlike other cities in Southeast Asia which are the capitals of other big Nations like Bangkok and Thailand KOA Loomer and Malaysia or Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam this is a very small Queen capital city so the city gets a little bit of a bum wrap which I don't think is entirely Justified there aren't a lot of attraction here per se but it's the kind of place where you can come and just chill out and relax there's really good food it's cheap and it's a good Hub to get to different places in the country like you can get to Long pong in the North or you can head south to Savanah cat or 4,000 Islands this afternoon we wanted to visit watt cette but unfortunately we left left it a bit too late the temple has already closed so we can't actually go inside but we're going to give you a little tour of the surroundings we get here before 4 p.m. people yeah [Music] so this is the place I was most excited to visit we made it to the triumphal Arch and we are going to be climbing all the way up it's only a couple stories high why the sad face we seem to be on a roll here because we just got here and apparently it's closed it closed at 4:00 just like the temple Clos at 4:00 and we missed it because we wanted to eat Indian food we put Indian food before sightseing well actually you did but oh be quiet so we had three major things planned so far two of those have become absolute failures let's see if we can make it to the mayong river before we miss sunset [Music] [Music] [Music] normally when we travel to a destination we like to spend 6 seven days basically close to a week because we do have online work workan jobs but venan was unfortunately just a stopover so we only really had one day to go out and explore so this is a bit of an unusual capital in the sense that it's very small and it doesn't necessarily offer a lot of attractions for visitors however I really enjoyed being able to spend a few days here and just relax and enjoy the surroundings because it has a very peaceful feel today we are eating lunch at the Bale well in hoan and this is the very small local restaurant they have a fixed menu actually there is no menu they just bring you food and you pay a fixed price and you eat as much as you want and their focus is country pancakes and spring rolls which we both love mhm [Music] yeah salad yep put the salad in cucumber cucumber right andin cheese and spr and a spring roll oh it's going to be a crunchy and yeah oh wow okay uhhuh now that is a special roll that's got a meat okay okay thank you very much yes we make like this nice excellent so I didp here yeah that's okay give it a try Audrey should we okay yeah okay mhm oh okay yeah here we go how was that mhm wow Hard To Bite huh so you're going to what well Sam here wasn't paying attention to the whole assembly process so I will have to demonstrate how to roll a spring roll okay so we add a little bit of greens some lettuce oops little fumbling with the Chopsticks there here hey hey hey don't be hating some greens so maybe some of this this looks good yep okay then she said this is our kimchi which looks a bit different from the kimchi we ate in Korea Vietnamese style kimchi y so let's add some must be pickled vegetables yeah then she added a spring roll and oh don't forget the meat the meat let's try this one try small one yeah I don't know if it's chicken or beef but looks good smells good no that is a super loaded roll okay now tight this um voila this is kind of it and now you add just a little bit of chili to the sauce it's kind of a peanut based sauce I think Y and we dip and enjoy well there comes more food VOA oh wow oh wow here's the country pancakes thank youum [Music] [Music] okay food monster so this delectable roll this time instead of the spring roll it has the country pancake inside of it so we're going to give a try to that [Music] one oh how's the taste is that better the walls are amazing you got pancakes to Spring off them the greens the skewed sa all in this happy boy and if that Feast was enough we've got a little sweet treat to end off with ooh what flavor did you get I got cherry and the dessert just keeps on coming now we have pineapple pineapple oh wow do you have any room for that well e it okay seriously that was the Feast of Feasts normally country pancakes or spring rolls or sat taste great on their own but all wrapped up together in one big roll dipped into a peanut sauce wow our lunch came to 180,000 dong which is about $9 I think that's a great price because they just kept bringing out plates and plates of food and we were stuffed and then they were offering us dessert and it was like oh I don't want to turn it down I guess I'll eat it anyway so yeah great selection there the service there is really friendly almost in a very unique kind of way there was one time where the lady was coming coming over and she looked like it appeared she was going to be wrapping up a roll for us but instead she just grabbed a saté and popped it right in Audrey's mouth and at the very end of the meal she came over and noticed I was looking hot she undid a napkin for me I thought she was going to put it in my hands oh no she just came and rubbed my whole face right down oh yeah",False,"20141024 - 50 Things to do in Southeast Asia Travel Guide, Attractions and Asian Cuisine.en.srt"

We are visiting the Elephant Nature Park, which is about sixty kilometers outside of the city. This is an elephant rescue and rehabilitation center, so we're going to be showing you around. This center is also a refuge for a number of injured and abandoned animals such as dogs, cats, water buffalo and others. We have a bucket full of fresh fruit and on today's menu for the elephants are bananas and watermelons. Hi Baby! There you go. No bananas. Nope! That was my first time touching an elephant and there skin is surprisingly course and hairy. Right now the rescue center is home to thirty seven elephants. Thirty two of them are female and five of them are male. These are Asian elephants, which vary from the African elephant. The African elephant is actually a lot larger than the Asian elephant and they also have much bigger ears. Most of the elephants on the site have been rescued from logging, tourism and begging industries. This is the happiest time of day! The elephants are now being bathed. Overall, the experience at the Elephant Nature Park has been phenomenal. We've really enjoyed having an opportunity to feed, bathe and interact with all of the elephants. It is a great alternative to doing the trekking where you are just sitting on top of the elephant and they are working. This way you get to spend time with the elephant in its natural environment feeding it and just having a great time. This is the hillside town of Pai. It is about 3.5 hours away from Chiang Mai and this is where we've been spending the weekend. We are staying at the Pai Chan Cottages and this is our private little Bungalow, so let's go have a look inside. Hey! Come on in! This is our humble little room here. You can see we've got a nice big size bed and mosquito net over here. Fortunately this time of the year we haven't had to be using it very often. It's freezing at night! It is freezing so likely the mosquitoes have all died. The best part about this place are the views. Check out this: rice fields! Am I interrupting your nap? You're just too cute and wrinkly. Look at that little nose. Meow meow! We've only got a few days left here in Thailand and I've been hearing from friends raving about Pai for years and I've always put off coming here. This time I said 'There is no way we're going to leave Thailand without coming to Pai."" Now I understand what all of the fuss is about. This place is wonderful. It is one of the most relaxing towns I've ever visited and we're going to show you around. You'll get to see first hand why we love it here. What are you doing? I couldn't be anymore relaxed than in this hammock right now. At this rate, I don't even know if we're get into town. One of the main reasons people come to Pai is to just relax and totally chill out. A lot of other destinations you go to visit temples, you go to do other types of things but here it is just enjoying the scenery, wandering around and swinging on a hammock. Those are the top things to do and I'm loving it so far. We seem to have found hippy central just across the river. There is a cool little bar called sunset bar and it can be reached via a bamboo bridge. Shall we check it out? That was awesome! We crossed that rickety old bridge and then we came to some really cool looking guesthouses and now we're here in the fields. One of the draws to Pai is being able to explore the countryside. Yesterday, I rented my very first scouter. It only cost me three dollars a day and I got a helmet with that. It was a great way to explore. I thought it was going to be kind of tricky riding it for the first time but it was a lot of fun. You did well didn't you? It opened up a lot of the surrounding areas that would have been tough to reach by foot. Aside from chilling out and relaxing in Pai one of the few things that we actually really want to do is to take a trip over and visit the hot springs. We're here in Pai visiting the hot springs. This is the thirty five degree pool and I'm swinging like Tarzan. Well not exactly but I'd like to think that. Oooh Oooh Oooh! That giant white Buddha over there is something I plan on visiting tomorrow morning when I wake up. I can't swing. I need an assistant to swing me. Sam, come swing me! I'm just kidding. I'm kidding! No, Sam. Sam no! Oh, my gosh! What are you doing? Okay, I just want to get you on the hammock. I don't want to go flying! No. Okay, just go back on and say something. Go fetch me a drink! We boarded a river taxi, one of our favorite ways of getting around Bangkok, to visit one of the most iconic landmarks of the entire city. Today is one of our last days in Thailand and actually one of our last days in Southeast Asia. We've decided to do a bit of sightseeing around Bangkok and we are visiting Wat Arun. This is the Temple of Dawn located on the west bank of the Chao Phraya river. I'm already sweating profusely and now it is time to go climb this massive temple. I've seen Wat Arun a few times while traveling down the Chao Phraya river. It is really interesting because from a distance it just looks like it is a grey temple made out of concrete but once you actually get here and walk up close to it you can see all of the intricate little details like it is made up of broken tiles and ceramics. It is really cool. It is a bit of a surprise. And it gets even steeper. That was easily the scariest set of stairs I have ever climbed. The steps were like this high and they were only this wide, so your feet could barely fit on there. I had to come down seated the whole time - like just on my butt. Some tips for visiting Wat Arun. First, make sure you bring tonnes of water. We brought two water bottles and we've just guzzled them. I swear, I've sweated about half of my body weight. And second, even though it is a really steep climb - even if you're afraid of heights like I personally am - it is still worth going up. The views are amazing. So it is Saturday night in Chiang Mai and today we are heading to the Saturday Night Market. Well, we're still a few blocks away but I know we're close. You know why? Because I can smell the food. Background music playing. What do you got there? So I got myself a twisted potato which is a lot like the tornado chips we used to have in Korea. It looks like it is all seasoned? It's nice. Barbecued flavored. You're going to be sharing that? You are wasting the chips. Background music playing. Yes, blueberry. That looks good. It's like blueberry cheesecake with ice cream. It's going to be messy. Snow ice cream with blueberry sauce drizzled over top. How articulate. Mmmmmmm. Live music playing from the streets. Background music playing. So what did you get? I've got some pan-fried dumplings that are very similar to the Korean gun mandu that we often had when we were living as teachers in Korea. So let's see if these are as good? They look hot. Yeah. Pretty good. Background music playing. Someone found his favorites here. So what started as just a little snack out here at the market has turned into a full on feast. I've got dim sum and fried spring rolls. Looking good. I got this - German sausage. Very good. Background music playing. And in case we didn't quite have enough to eat - a sweet little dessert treat. So that is a banana and egg roti with lots of chocolate and condensed milk drizzled over top. Background music playing. We came to this night market. We were supposed to go for a walk but guess what? We ended up having a massive feast and so instead of exercise we were gorging the whole time but it was worth it. So today we are having lunch at a little place called the Peppermint cafe. This is in some little back-alley in Chiang Mai. We're sitting outside right by the street and we're going to enjoy some more Northern Thai food. And you know how much we like our back-alley restaurants. Background music playing. We're here for original Thai food and good shakes. Looks like you got just that. So today we are having a dish that is called Khao Soi and if you just look down over here you can see that it kind of looks like a curry type soup and we have regular boiled noodles, some crispy noodles and chicken over top. So this is a Burmese influenced dish from Northern Thailand and it literally means cut rice. This is one of Northern Thailand's most famous dishes. background music playing. So I've had this dish once before and I think my favorite part is the combination of the soft egg noodles mixed in with the crispy ones. It's just a nice, crunchy, soft texture and the curry sauce gives it a bit of an extra kick, so here we go. I love coconut based curries and this is quite similar to Massaman Curry. background music playing. This is a really popular street food in Northern Thailand. It's actually quite hard to find overseas in Thai restaurants, so that means you have to come to Northern Thailand and try it for yourself. Empty plate over here. The sign of a good meal. Overall, that meal was delicious and coming in at just 59 Baht per dish - what value! You know we love to eat, so today we've signed up for a cooking course where we're going to learn how to make some of our favorite Thai dishes. Right now we're at the local market, so we're just going to be walking around picking out some of the ingredients we'll need today for the class. Let's have a look. Judging from the amount of cooking videos we make you'd probably think that we're constantly in the kitchen and that we always like to cook. That couldn't be further from the truth. Most of the time when we're on the road we eat out, so this is actually kind of an excuse to get into the kitchen and cook and to actually try and make food because normally we don't do that. We have now arrived at the Thai Farm Cooking School. We drove about seventeen kilometers outside of Chiang Mai and it is a completely different world out here. We're just surrounded by nature and an organic farm. We're actually going to be picking a lot of vegetables from here. We had a choice between doing the cooking course in the city or going out to the countryside and I think we've made the right decision. Now clean rice already. Please come inside. I would like you to pick by yourself the whole leaf basil. I'm making my Yellow curry paste. Pound, pound, pound! Harder! Faster! Stronger! So Sam is lagging a little behind right? Come on. Master Chef here - look at that. Perfection. No, I really am lagging behind, I better hustle up. I'm making a yellow curry today. This is mine. This is what I created and Sam went for the green curry, so this is his. And I'd like to point out I don't think he did a very good job. Oh, that just fell in there. What is this? Whatever. Total chunks. You get an F! Alright, oh! It's boiling! It is not supposed to boil. We're making the Tom Yum soup. Mine is going to have shrimp and I've got my coconut milk here, so I'm going to be adding some ingredients - mushrooms, onions. I'm ready to try fine creation. This is my Tom Yum with shrimp. Let's see. I made mine really sweet. I think maybe I put in to much sugar but it is kind of nice and creamy because I used coconut as a base. You need to add more salt or fish sauce then. Mine does need more salt. How is yours? You look like a farmer drinking soup. I'm keeping this hat I swear. I'm quite happy with mine. I put quite a bit of salt in it and I also put fish sauce. I'm making my Yellow curry now. I'm just stirring the coconut milk. I put in the curry paste I made earlier. There is also some pumpkin and potatoes and I accidentally added some leaves that I wasn't supposed to but shhhh.....Cheater! Not that we've chopped everything up we're going to be throwing this into the Wok and making our stir fried rice. I was wrong about this dish. It is not a stir fried rice. It is just a vegetable stir-fry. It's really good. I made one with chicken and string beans and mushrooms and here is my yellow curry with potatoes and pumpkin. Is it good? Uh-huh. At this point in the day I'm getting completely stuffed. I actually wouldn't mind taking a siesta right now but we're going to be making two more dishes. I'm going to be making a Pad Thai and then a Mango Sticky Rice. So I'm suffering from what my family calls bulbous plumptitude. I'm making Pad Thai. Your favorite. Here is my Pad Thai which is probably one of the easier Thai dishes you can make. We saved the very best for last. Here we have our favorite Thai dessert - Mango Sticky Rice - and it has some deep fried Mung Bean on top. It is crispy. This is going to be good. Alright, let's check out that first bite. It is nice and coconut-y and it is amazing. So overall that was a really cool experience learning how to cook Thai food. I made five different dishes. I'm beyond full. Like I feel like I'm ready to hibernate now. So this was 1100 Baht. It was like lunch and dinner and the thing I really liked about this particular school was that it was out in the countryside where we were able to get outside of the city and away from the pollution and whatnot and just have a really cool organic cooking experience. Tonight we are visiting the Sunday Night Market in Chiang Mai and right now we are at Thapea Gate and this is where the market starts running one kilometer into the old city. So we're going to be wandering around, sampling some food and showing you what it is like over here on a Sunday. Background music playing. So you can buy a lot of handicrafts here at this market. For example, silk, scarves, wood carvings. You can get some paintings. They have ceramics. Silverware. Lots of jewelry. I mean you can browse here for hours on end. And trinkets galore. Mmmmm. Background music playing. When you get tired of walking around in the night market you can just head over here to sit down and relax and get a nice Thai foot massage. Thirty minutes for two dollars right? Probably. Background music playing. Actually it's 80 Baht for the foot massage. You can get a cheaper one at the Chiang Mai park. background music playing. Sizzling noises. Crowd noises. One spring roll. Yeah. One tempura. One of this. One of this? Ah, yeah one. Well you sure loaded up with some tasty treats. Okay, so this is my second dinner. I have some deep fried tempura eggplant with a sweet and sour sauce on top and fresh spring rolls with carrots and cilantro maybe and some noodles. Okay, try one of them? And that would be? It tastes very healthy. Hahaha! Is it good? Mmmm, it's not as flavorful as I would have hoped. Here, have a look. It's actually bean sprouts not noodles. I was wrong. Bean spouts and tofu and some carrots. And what is this over here? Well, I must have been a monkey in a past life because whenever I get a chance to try a banana I'm always in there. And this is the deep fried version. So, it's already kind of smushed up here. Awesome. Does it have some kind of special sauce over top? No, there is no special sauce it's just deep-fried and the banana is really mushy and moist in the inside. Okay, this is my tempura eggplant. Mmmm. Okay, that tastes a lot better. It's almost like a french fry. Can I say that? Yep, it has a nice sweet and sour sauce over top and it's very oily. Um, but that means it is very flavorful. French fry on a stick. Background music playing. And that concludes our visit to the hectic Chiang Mai Sunday Night Market. Background music playing. This afternoon we're going to be visiting the Golden Mount and to get there we'll be taking public transportation namely water taxis. When exploring Bangkok one of my favorite ways of getting around is hoping on a river taxi. The system is very extensive. Background music playing. So these taxi boats have blue tarps along the side that you have to lift up once the boat starts moving and that is because the river looks like that. You would not want to fall in there or get any of that water in your mouth. Oh, I can even smell it. Whew! That's stinky! Background music playing. It's a lovely day here in Chiang Mai and we're going to give you a tour of our neighborhood. Background music playing. So we live in a very residential neighborhood and in this area you're going to a see a lot of traditional homes, as well as luxury mansions, so let's have a look. Background music playing. Hi, Puppy. You're cute. Do I smell nice? Background music playing. Hi puppies. How are you? Hello. You're cute. Look at you. Barking. Hello Puppy. So we've encountered lots of friendly dogs this morning. One of my favorite things about this neighborhood is that we live right by Chiang Mai Gate and it is a great place to get lots of really tasty street food at night and the best part is that it is so cheap. So you can get mango shakes and mango sticky rice, noodle soups. There is just so much good stuff to eat there. And what is your favorite part about our neighborhood? I like just how peaceful and quiet it is. Chiang Mai can be a really hectic and chaotic city in certain sections but where we live it's just tranquil. And one of the perks of living in our neighborhood - we live right beside a Silver temple. Background music playing. So that is an example here of one of the moor traditional style Thai homes. And right across from it you have a super modern mansion I'd say. Background music playing. So that concludes our tour of the neighborhood and we'll show you a different part of the city next time. We're being deported from Thailand, so we're planning our escape. No, okay, actually it is time for a Visa run. We've been living in Thailand for a month now and we only get thirty days, so today we're going to Burma to get an extension and right now we've stopped in Chiang Rai where we have this lovely sulfur spring that smells like eggs. So we're not too far from Chiang Rai right now. We've got here in like record time. Our driver is an absolute maniac. He's driving on the wrong lane in places where it says forty kilometers he's going like one hundred or one hundred and twenty but at least we're going to get there fast if we actually make it there alive. Water spring noises. Background music playing. And just like that we're in Burma and this is my little pass. I've only got an hour until we've got to cross the border again. Background music playing. Three for 6 baht. So I've just got a little goody bag of treats. I honestly don't have any clue what it is. We really don't have a lot of time. We were only given one hour to cross the border and get back, so now we've got to head back to the Thai side already. So sad. Yeah. Background music playing. Okay, so how the Visa run works. We took a bus from Chiang Mai to Mae Sae and that was 650 Baht and it took about four hours. Then once we reached the border we had to go through Immigration, get our passports stamped and we paid five hundred Baht to get our re-entry Visa basically. The whole process cost only eleven hundred and fifty Baht which is slightly less than forty US dollars. So that gives us an extra two weeks in the country before we need to hop another border in order to extend again. Background music playing. This is day three in Chiang Mai. We just moved here a few days ago and we already have a favorite restaurant called Chang Chalaad. Today we are going to be ordering some classic Thai meals. I've been to Thailand probably close to ten times and this place literally has the best Pad Thai I've ever had anywhere. I like this dish so much. That is why I can't stop smiling. So Pad Thai is the kind of dish you know even if you've never been to Thailand. You can get this back in Canada or really anywhere in the world. The ingredients - well, it is a noodle dishes as you can see. It also has tofu because we got the vegetarian version. It has egg, peanuts, beansprouts, peanut sauce. It's just so tasty, so filling, so good. So what makes this the best Pad Thai I've ever had? Well, it's especially the sauce. This is the most tangy, sweet and rich. It's almost a bit creamy sauce I've ever had on a Pad Thai. This must be a secret recipe because I've never had anything quite like this before. It is just really really unique. So Chang Chalaad is sort of this tiny little unassuming restaurant that I first visited back in 2008. It has incredible food, so that has always been one of my biggest travel tips to try out these little small places. Try out these places that aren't on trip advisor or the Lonely Planet. They are often the best places you can eat. So the price of the Pad Thai was only 60 Baht, which is two US dollars. What a deal! It is Saturday Night in Chiang Mai and today we are heading to the Saturday Night market. Well, we're still a few blocks away but I know we're close - you know why? - because I can smell the food. What do you got there? I got myself a twist potato, which is a lot like the tornado chips we used to have in Korea. It looks like it is all seasoned. It is nice. It is barbecue flavored. You are going to be sharing that! You are wasting the chips. Yeah, that's blueberry. It looks like blueberry cheesecake with ice cream. It is going to be messy. Snow ice cream with blueberry sauce drizzled over top. How articulate. Mmmmmm. What did you get? I've got some pan-fried dumplings. They are very similar to the Korean gun mandu we often had when we were living as teachers in Korea. Let's see if these are as good. They look hot. They're pretty good. Someone found his favorites here. What started as just a little snack out here at the market has turned out to be a full on feast. I've got dim sum and fried spring rolls. Looking good. I got this - German sausage. It is very good. Krap. In case, we didn't quite have enough to eat - a sweet little dessert treat. That is banana egg roti with lots of chocolate and condensed milk drizzled over top. Background music playing. So here we are in Chiang Mai and it is August - the rainy season. And it rained for maybe about twenty minutes and the whole city has flooded. Come have a look. Background music playing. At one point about thirty minutes ago the water got so high on our bikes that we had to take refuge in a coffee shop and we pushed a tuk-tuk out of the water. background music playing. I thought I lost my shoe at one point. The current took it away and I just couldn't reach it because the water was too deep. But then once we finally managed to get out of that street that was flooded. Low and behold there was my shoe sitting on the sidewalk. You are one lucky girl. I am lucky. And that is a lucky shoe you are holding. Background music playing. We had no plans to make a video today but Mother Nature gave us a little surprise. background music playing. Background music playing. So we ended up at the Golden Mount in Bangkok and it looks like there is some kind of celebration going on. We're going to see what it is all about. Thai speaking in the background. Coin noises. So out here we've got all of the different animal signs. I'm the cock or rooster and so I've got my lucky piece of Baht to put in here. Let's see if it's going to bring some good luck. Background music playing. So this is actually a really nice place to cool off because they have mist blowing on you as you go up the steps. Background music playing. Banging noises. Bells ringing. Gong. Gong. Gong. Background music playing. So I visited this temple about a month ago and there was no one here. Today happens to be a big Buddhist holiday, so everyone is coming here to pay their respects and the place is just packed. Bells ringing. Background music playing. Some of the best views of Bangkok from up here. Bells ringing. So today we are back at our favorite Thai restaurant but we're going to be having a special meal. We have ordered a set for two people that focuses on Northern Thai dishes, so we are going to get a sampling of different curries that come along with sticky rice. And this is what it might look like. Our first dish has arrived and it is called Khao Soi and it is fried noodles on top of a hearty curry. That looks amazing. It does. Let's dig into that baby. I'm going to try my first fried noodle. I've never had anything like this. It's kind of nice and the curry is kind of spicy. How is that? It's a very flavorful spicy curry. I can tell it is made from coconut milk. It's not a very thick curry. It is more stew-like and soup-y but it is really nice on a warm day like this. I'm enjoying it. Sticky rice inside. So a lot of the Northern Thai dishes have pork in them, so as you can see over here we have a pork sausage. We have something that looks like ground pork with nice green herbs and this might also be pork if you ask me. One of the characteristic elements of Northern Thai food is that you eat your side dishes with sticky rice. This is going to be tasty. So I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be using my hands or not but because this is sticky rice I am. We're going to dip it over here and see how it tastes. Spicy or sweet? This one is surprisingly sweet. So I'm going to try one of these little puffs in another kind of dipping sauce. That looks like it could be spicy. Yeah, it is spicy. Burning your mouth? We also have a nice pumpkin stew over here with tofu. Spicy? Not spicy. It's just really hot. Okay, what is next? So next up in the dishes to try here would be the ground pork. It looks like it has been marinated in a nice little sauce. Very strong flavor with the sauce. It looks like soy sauce but that is hard going down. Very tasty though. So it is only our first week in Chiang Mai in Northern Thailand but we are quite quickly discovering that this part of the country has a lot to offer in the cooking department. Normally, when you think Thai food you think of Pad Thai, Green Curries but really there is so much variety here. Today we had dishes that we had never even heard of before and they were so tasty. We still don't even know exactly what they are. We don't know the n ames. I'm sure we will learn them over the course of our time here but for now what we can tell you is that Northern Thai food is really tasty. So just when we thought the meal was finally over and we are so stuffed they bring dessert out for us and it is amazing. So here you can see bananas. Those are just slices of bananas in a sweet, thick coconut cream and it is amazing really. Oh yeah, you need to try it. I want to see your face when you bite into that. Wow! It almost has a bit of a rum caramel type flavor which really accentuates the coconut milk. That was seriously the feast of feasts. We paid 300 Baht in total for that which is roughly ten US dollars and it was worth every penny or should I say every Baht. Background music playing. Looking happy on the train. We're on a train to Bangkok! So right now we're in the dining carriage and as you can see there is no AC so the windows are open and the fans are blowing but I am still sweating profusely. Background music playing. Karaoke music playing in the background. Background music playing. What is wrong with this. Background music playing. A heart. Are you dreaming about cats or hamsters? cats? Nod, if it is cats. Yes, I'm dreaming about cats. Background music playing. So the first travel agent we went to in Chiang Mai told us there were no seats left on the train but look at this. We're on a train and no one is up there. And we are going to Bangkok on the train that is very full. NOT! So basically what happened is we went to this really shady travel agent for the first time and what they wanted to do was sell us a bus ticket. A really really overpriced bus ticket. Normally a bus ticket is only 400 Baht from Chiang Mai to Bangkok but they were trying to sell it to us for 750 Baht. They said no trains and only five seats left on the bus. Yeah, right. This will be my first time going to Bangkok. Last time I was there I was just in transit so I haven't seen any of the city and that is it for now. The end. This video is for all of our Korean fans. Background music playing. It's been ages since we've made a video. Well, after a year of living in Korea you know that you can't keep us too far away from Korean food, so 'yes' we are in Thailand. We are in Thailand but we are eating Korean food for dinner tonight. Background music playing. So the first dish we are having is Gun Mandu which is fried dumplings. This was one of my favorites back in Korea and this is really tasty. They did an excellent job. We normally had that at the Chungook Chip. The Chinese restaurants in Korea. Good stuff? Oh, yeah. It has been literally months since I've had kimchi. I've been missing this so much. This particular one is really sour, which I like. And here we have our Kaeran Jjim, which is sort of like an egg souffle and this is something we often had in Korea - especially when we were at barbecue places. So the Kaeranjjim is different from what we've had in Korea. This one is a bit more watered down and I have to say I do prefer the more authentic taste. So up next I am trying the kimchi jeon, which is kind of like a Korean pancake and it has lots of kimchi, so this should be really flavorful. Good stuff? It is nice and fluffy and you can really taste the kimchi and there is also a bit of spice in here. One of the big differences of eating Korean food here in Thailand is that the side dishes are not included. Normally in Korea side dishes are free and if you finish the whole thing they just keep refilling them for you, but over here we ordered six side dishes and that was 40 Baht, which is about a dollar and thirty three cents. It was still a bargain but it is not like Korea where you get it for free. And if the first serving wasn't enough we've just ordered a second helping of the pan-friend dumplings and the kimchi pancake. Background music playing. So the big question - what is Korean food like in Thailand? We had two dishes that we really loved. It was the gunmandu and the kimchjeon but we actually ended up ordering seconds because both dishes were so tasty; however, with kaeranjjim it wasn't as great as it is in Korea. I think part of the problem is that they don't use the stone pot which I think helps it boil better and maybe it just evaporates a bit in water. So for the kimch jeon, we ended up spending one hundred Baht, which is just over three dollars. Same for the gunmandu and the Kaeranjjim came in at 60 Baht which is two dollars. So, overall it was an affordable meal. Roughly with side dishes and water you're looking at about ten dollars or roughly 300 Baht. So if you're craving some Korean food and you find yourself in Chiang Mai, Thailand we highly recommend this little place. It is called Korea House. Background music playing. So we're still here at our favorite Thai restaurant Chang Chalaad and we're going to be having a delectable dessert. One of my absolute favorites and to be honest much like the Pad Thai this is also the best dish I've had here served at this particular restaurant. Background music playing. We've got ourselves a friendly little visitor here. Hello kitty cat. Meow. Background music playing. So for those who have never tried this dessert it's my favorite in Thailand. Basically, what it is sticky rice and on top of it you have these sweet condensed coconut milk, which obviously has some sugar added and then you have these wonderfully sliced mangoes. Background music playing. So I would like to preface this by saying that I hate rice. I don't ever eat rice back home. But this dessert has really changed my mind. I'd say it is better than chocolate and better than cheesecake. And those are my two favorites. So that's saying a lot. Mango sticky rice. You have to try it. Mmmmmmm. To me what makes this the best mango sticky rice, I've ever had is that the cream sauce is sticky and the coconut milk is quite thick. This is the creamiest I've ever had. Oh, this is sooo sooo good. So the price of our delicious mango sticky rice dessert is only 50 Baht which is about a dollar seventy five. Background music playing. So tonight we are at the food market right by Chiang Mai Gate. We actually came here looking for dumpling noodle soup but our favorite vendor is not here, so instead we are having dessert. Nothing quite like banana egg roti with chocolate sauce and we're going to show you how it is ordered and made. One, please. Background music playing. Speaking in Thai. Pounding noises. Sizzling sounds. Your face like Arabic. Pharaoh huh? Look like Pharaoh. Arabic. Do you eat now? Yes. Thank you. Chopping noises. Chocolate. Okay. Kop Kun Krap. Thank you. So this kind of banana pancake is popular all over SE Asia but this form being roti is quite different from the one we tried - especially in Malaysia. It's more thick. It's fluffier. It's got a lot of banana stuffed inside and it is just loaded with chocolate sauce and condensed milk. Background music playing. Ooh la la. Ready for the first bite. So good, so good that she is speechless. You can really taste the banana and the roti is very moist and wet with the chocolate sauce and the condensed milk. It's just really tasty and probably not the best thing to be eating since we're on a health kick but we need a little cheat every once in a while. Yeah, that's real good. The chocolate sauce is awesome. Even better though is nutella. If you can find a place making it with nutella that's pure bliss. So this delicious little dessert / snack was only 30 Baht which is one dollar. Background music playing. Background music playing. So we just came back to Chiang Mai after a Visa run in Penang, Malaysia and also a short little holiday in Phuket. Are we ever glad to be back. One of the main things that we missed about Chiang Mai was the street food that we get really close to our apartment. Today we're having one of our favorite meals. Background music playing. So let me give you a very special tour of my bowl. Ooh la la. So we have the yellow egg noodles. They look very nice. It also comes with some dumplings. Today it is pork. We also have slices of pork over here. Some bean sprouts and lots of greens, which add a lot of flavor to the soup. One of the things I love about this particular night stall stand is that we can add our own different spices exactly what we want. There is lots of chilly. That's what I'll be putting in mine. So I'm hardly putting any because this is super potent and I always end up making it way too spicy and then I can't finish my dish. Let's hope that is not too much this time. Noodles. I did make it too spicy again. Background music playing. So my favorite part about this dish is the wanton like dumplings. They are absolutely delicious and we're having pork dumplings today. Tasty? Oh, yeah. So you've seen us film a few other food videos at Chiang Mai gate, but the reason we keep coming back to this place is because there is so much variety. There are so many local foods that we can try, so we're constantly being introduced to new Thai meals. This is our favorite dining spot. Outdoors by the gate. Nice and cheap too. Samuel Jeffery, keeping it classy. You dripped! So the total for each meal is 35 Baht, which is just over a dollar. Background music playing. So today we're doing something exceptionally unusual. We've upgraded our flights to first class (business class) and here it is called Silk class. We're going to be flying silky smooth all the way to Bangkok. Background music playing. So normally we like to fly very budget. You know, trying to find he cheapest tickets possible to our destination. However, because it was Christmas we decided we'd splurge a little on our flight to Bangkok and Sam was able to find First Class tickets 'business class' for a pretty reasonable price I'd say, right? We only ended paying about 1200 Baht each to upgrade. That's about $40 and this is our very first time ever flying business class, so we're relishing this moment. Fancy! I'm Mr. Fancy pants;) What's that I see on your table? A fancy table cloth for my lunch. Background music playing. So for my first business class lunch I'm having chicken, I believe. No, fish sticks! With tartar sauce. Oh yeah. Hit the spot? For sure. And what did you order? And I ordered duck. Mmmmm. Does it come with a sauce? Nice and chewy. Um, no. background music playing. What's so funny? I don't even like 'Just For Laughs' I don't! But there is a baby peeing all over the fruit. Hahaha! Background music playing. The experience of flying business class was certainly something out of our element. It was pretty cool I had to admit being able to stay at the lounge, eat snacks, use wifi on my computer before the flight; however, I still consider myself more of a budget traveler and unless I win the lottery I think I'll be flying economy class more often than not. background music playing. Time to catch the city line into Bangkok. And tomorrow we're off to Scotland. Background music playing. We're here at the train station in Bangkok. We just finished a conference that lasted about four days and now we're heading back to home which is Chiang Mai. Background music playing. Hello. Six. Background music playing. And we are going to play a game of word association. Bangkok. The Hangover. Chiang Mai. Home. Toronto. China. I say China. Wait a second. China because whenever I say Toronto the way Torontonians say it people here 'China.' Bangkok. Crazy. Pad Thai. Mmmmmm. Delicious. Hockey. Blackhawks. Yeah! Football. Boring. Football. Boring. Heah! What team are you supposed to cheer for? Um, Canada. No, Argentina. Okay, good. Silly. Goose. Bunny. Honey bunny. Psy. Oppa Gangnam Style. Hey, you sexy lady. That's not a word. Stanley Cup. Chicago Blackhawks. They're going to win it. Background music playing. Someone got their nails done. I got a French manicure. My first one ever in my whole life and Sam is quite fascinated by it, as am I. Background music playing. This morning we're venturing up to Doi Suthep and there is a temple atop the mountain overlooking Chiang Mai, so we're going to be taking a red songthaew to get there and hopefully the views of the city will be amazing. Here is the songthaew crew! Say hi! Hi! We're going to Doi Suthep. Woo Hoo! We just got out of the vehicle and this is our first vantage point. Unfortunately, it is still a bit hazy outside, so we don't have a great view at the moment. But the city is there somewhere. The long climb begins. I'm not entirely sure how many steps we have to go but I know it is going to be a long way. I think there is over three hundred. Ideally you should be able to see the views of Chiang Mai from up here but today it is just really hazy, so there is a cloud hanging over the city. We can't really see much, which is unfortunate. That concludes our visit to Doi Suthep. It is definitely different than what I expected. I was kind of expecting this quaint little temple on top of a hill and instead it is an extremely popular tourist attraction. It is really crowded over here. I would say the exterior of Doi Suthep is quite similar to a lot of the other Wats we have visited here in Chiang Mai. However, the highlight for me was actually going inside the temple because there is a courtyard with a golden stupa and you can walk around light candles and there is incense burning, so that was a great experience. Today we are at Wat Suan Dok and we hear there is an amazing restaurant on the temple grounds. It is called Imm Aim and it used to be called Pun Pun, so that is what we're searching for right now. It is a vegetarian restaurant and it has come highly recommended from a friend but before we go have lunch we're going to go for a wander around the temple. So far I'm kind of enjoying the minimal design here and they have a really cool outdoor open kitchen. You can see them preparing your food. The do it yourself water reminds me a lot of being back in Korea where we used to eat at the Kimbap restaurants and we would go up and grab our own waters. Our first dish has arrived - the vegetarian spring rolls. It is hot. I'm burning my mouth but this is really good. These are definitely some of the best spring rolls I've had here in Chiang Mai. Have a look inside. It has bean sprouts, glass noodles, some vegetables. It is really flavorful. They've added some nice spices in there. There comes the rest of our food. It looks amazing. Let's get back to your spring roll. I got distracted there. Have a bite! Yeah, these are excellent. My favorite part about this is the tamarind dipping sauce. That is really unique and tangy. The masterpiece of a salad has arrived. Ooh lah lah. What kind of sauce is that? I think it may be pumpkin based on the color. We'll see. This is a really healthy salad. If you look over here you can see we have some green beans, red beans, corn and there is even some barley and of course we love cheese so we had to get some feta cheese on top. Only an extra 20 Baht. I would say it was well worth it. Oh, yes. How is it? That's wonderful. So good you've have three bites and I haven't had any. We have a little taste of India happening over here. Indeed, we do. This here is a little bit of roti flat bread and this is the Indian curry. I don't really know what is in it so it'll be an interesting first bite. It is nice and thick. I can tell that. It looks like it has a lot of vegetables. That's wonderful. It has got a coconut base. It is spicy and yeah I can taste a lot of different vegetables in there. That would be our dessert. This was listed as sweet potato honey. Sweet potato tea on the menu, so I was expecting a tea cup but apparently it is a dessert. Tea in a spoon. It tastes like ginger. That is ginger tea. That is not sweet potato. This is my dessert which I'm kindly sharing with Sam. Oh, yeah, I don't recall that part of the deal. Anyways, we're having bananas with coconut milk and if you look down here you can see giant slabs of banana. I'm going to take one of those and make sure I've got lots of coconut milk too. That is the face of satisfaction. Yeah? That awesome feast came to 300 Baht which is 10 USD and that included two shakes, three main dishes and two desserts. That is a lot of food for ten dollars for two people. Music playing in the background. So we are in Bangkok today and guess what our first attraction is going to be. Temples? Maybe a floating market? No, we're going to the mall. MBK because someone here needs appropriate clothes for an event we are attending tomorrow. That someone is not me. Give us a little update boy. What do you have so far? This is a very rare situation indeed. I've got two shopping bags in my hand. I've already picked up two collared shirts, so next up I need to find myself a pair of long pants. What's wrong with the ones you have right now? I don't have any right now. Background music playing. What you got over here? Well, I'm just taking a little shopping break. That's all. Some ice cream. Sushi buffet. Hot pot and ice creamy. My home. Oh Canada. So after a sixteen hour train ride followed by an intense hockey game where my favorite team the Chicago Blackhawks advanced to the Stanley Cup finals. Plus a heck of a lot of shopping. I'm completely knackered. I'm going to go back to the hotel and take a rest. Because tomorrow we have an important conference to attend. Well, that was another very cultural outing. We hope you enjoyed shopping. And here is a mascot to show you. Music playing in the background. Welcome back to Thailand! We're back in Chiang Mai and the first thing I'm showing you is my grimy filthy hands. My bike just broke down in the middle of the road. We're planning on doing a food video at one of our favorite vegetarian restaurants but the first thing I'm showing you is my messed up bike. Background music. For lunch today we biked all the way out to a restaurant called 'Salad Concept' On the way here Sam's bicycle kind of died, so we had to leave it behind but we finally arrived and we're going to show you what this place is like. So the cool thing about this place is that you can build your own salad or build your own wrap and that's what we're going to be doing today. All kinds of different ingredients you can choose. Let's get a wrap with pumpkin. what else? feta cheese. Where is the feta? It's a premium topping. Music in the background. Alright, I've got my order picked out for my wrap. Let's see what is on it. Croutons, pasta, carrots, tomatoes, bell peppers, pumpkin, raisins, grilled bacon, avocado and feta with Caesar dressing. How does that sound to you? So you get a whole bunch of free toppings (I think five) and then you can add extra toppings to that for a few more Baht. After that bike incident I'm splurging right now. Background music. Well, it's berry berry good! This is a berry shake. Hahahaha I think I have shake envy. It looks better than the juice I got. So this drink over here is guava, apple and passion fruit and it is so refreshing and tangy. MMMMM, oh, it's a little sour and crunchy because of the seeds but it's still good. So I've been noticing a bit of a interesting phenomenon in the last few months of travel. I often order things that Audrey doesn't seem to want. I don't think I want that, I don't think that'll be good and then as soon as it is brought to the table Audrey has food envy and tries to eat half of it. I do. So this time around I've ordered exactly the same thing that you are getting. So I'll have my own. Now does that look good or does that look good. I think mine looks better. Check this out. It has avacodo, pumpkin, pasta, bacon, olives, feta cheese. Let me take a big bite. It's going to be good. Mmmmmm. Amazing! So happy. It almost makes up for the bicycle incident. Dig in. Wow! These are some of the best wraps I've ever had anywhere. So for me there are two star ingredients in this wrap. First of all, the pumpkin - it just makes it nice and sweet and also this wrap has raisins which is something I've never had in a wrap or sandwich before but it seems to be quite popular in Thailand, so let's take another bite because I mean the first one was soooo good. Oooh, it's falling apart - oh my. Can you give me a little bit of that? No! So the two ingredients that really make this wrap amazing for me are the Caesar salad and the feta cheese. The Caesar salad actually has a little bit of Dijon mustard and it gives it a real kick. And the feta, well what doesn't taste good with feta? Background music. Well, you know us we're not really big on dessert, so well I guess we're just going to have to have them. Here is the peanut butter brownie cheesecake and if that didn't look decadent enough take a look at this one. This is apple strudel cheesecake. That looks amazing. Audrey doesn't like cheesecake so I'll be having all of it. Oh, please. You wish! So this is a pretty nice brownie. It's very dark, heavy, chocolaty and on top it has a little bit of cheesecake and then some chocolate mousse. So much chocolate. Each bite is chocalier than the next. Is it like a chocolate explosion in your mouth? Okay, cheesecake strudel. Wow, I mean apple strudel on its own taste good. Cheesecake on its own is really good. Putting them together - thats like a superpower dessert. So, overall that meal was a bit of a splurge for us. It came to just over 600 Baht, which is roughly $20 USD. Oh my! In SE Asia that is a real splurge. Ten dollars per person. Normally we'd would spend half, 1/3 or if we were having a local Thai meal even a 1/4. But it was worth every Baht because it was tasty. Traffic noises. It's seven AM in the morning and we are on Khao San Road in Bangkok. We just arrived in the city and we are on our way to our fancy hotel, so let's take a tuk-tuk ride. Keeping it real. Background music playing. Khaosarn road has really changed. Its become more upscale. It kind of reminds me a little bit of what has happened in Seoul's Itaewon. When I first came here in 2008 it was a lot more seedy and now the trend is definitely more upscale. Background music playing. The last time we were in Bangkok we were here for a blogging conference. This time we're staying here for a few days and then we're heading to a mystery destination, which you're going to tell us where it is. So where are we eventually going? Well, first we were celebrating my birthday here in Bangkok. I'm turning 26 this year. Someone is on the wrong side of their twenties now! Oh, shut up. Okay, and on the night of my birthday we are actually flying to Europe and this is going to be Sam's very first time going to Europe and we are going to Finland! I'm loving this train trip and I'm going to show you some scenic views - hopefully a sunset from the train window. Enjoy the sunset.",False,"20141008 - 30 Things to do in Thailand Travel Guide, Top Attractions & Thai Street Food.en.srt"

Aaaaaaahhhhhh! So today we have joined a free walking tour in Sofia, so we're going to be exploring the city and visiting some of the main sites. Background music playing. Man playing music on the street. Chanting, cheering and yelling. Football fans saluting. You can still here them in the background. So we just saw the most random mob. We have no idea what it is for. At first we thought it was a protest. Now maybe we're thinking it was a celebration over a football match. We have absolutely no idea. Music in the background. So that was a very brief tour of Sofia but hopefully we can show you more of the city in a few different videos. Music playing in the background For dinner tonight we're trying another restaurant that specializes in Bulgarian food. So we're at a place called Lubimoto. Music playing So for our appetizer we have ordered something called Chushki Burek. These are stuffed red peppers. They have feta cheese and we're going to pour a yogurt sauce over them, so it'll be tasty. Music playing It was feta cheese and tomatoes. I got it wrong guys. I like it a lot. Try some! So it has a crispy exterior and inside there is lots of feta. You can really taste the feta cheese and the dill and the yogurt. MMMMMM Music in the background So next up for the main course - we've got pork loin with potatoes and cheese and it's got a lot of ingredients here. Let me read it off: homemade gravy, bacon, pickles, mushrooms and yellow cheese. let's dig into that. Oh, wow! That's really tender and you can really taste the cheese and gravy. It reminds me a bit of a thanksgiving type of meal. Mmmm, it's very hearty on this cold day. Oh yeah. Another day another decadent dessert. So this is the restaurant's most popular dessert. It's called dessert Lubimoto and it's a chocolate mascarpone cake. Let's get a bit of whip cream with that. MMMMMM...very sweet. It tastes a little Italian. It's a bit like a cheesecake with a chocolate sauce. So that fantastic hearty meal was of excellent value. We only paid about $13 for it and we are stuffed.. Background music playing It is lunch time here in Sofia, so today we found a restaurant that's called Made In Home and we're going to be trying some Bulgarian food. Whatever that is. Music in the background I am very impressed by the beards here in this restaurant. Well, I'm here trying the local drink. Apparently it is called Rakia. I don't know much about it. It smells strong. Yeah, nice and strong. I'm pretty sure I'm going to hate the Rakia, so instead I went with something a bit safer. I'm having a lemonade. Homemade nonetheless. It's very sour but refreshing and think it also has mint leaves in it. Are you ready for the Rakia? No. Drink up. Oh my gosh. Honestly, I think it just tastes like chemicals. Chemicals that burn as they go down your throat. There is nothing appealing about it. The local beer here is fantastic. It has a nice malt taste. Music playing. Woo hoo! I drank the whole thing. So our starters have arrived. I'm having the tomato and vegetable soup. Mmmmm. Okay. What does okay mean? It's a little tangy. I can really taste the tomatoes but it's very creamy. Almost a bit carroty. So I like it. And how about you? What did you order for your starter? We we've got a goat cheese and fig salad. Let me try that here. This looks amazing. I can't wait to dig in. We've got some fig. Some cranberries as well. Big bite. How is that goat cheese? Wow. It's so fresh and warm. Goat cheese really compliments the salad. It is such a nice salty addition. Music playing. So I'm really excited about this meal. We just got a plate full of trout with potatoes covered in a cream sauce. And it just smells amazing. Music playing. Okay. It's so good I need to take a second bite. Jeez! Music playing. We weren't planning on having dessert but we were tempted when we saw a waitress walk by with a piece of cheesecake and now we've got it right here. We already ate the figs. Divine! Very decadent. So that was an amazing meal. I feel like everything that came out of the kitchen was like magic. I especially loved the salad with the goat cheese and then the hearty main dish with the potatoes and the fish. That was also amazing, so highly recommend it. Don't forget the cheesecake. And the cheesecake, yes. So that meal was a splurge. It almost came to $30 USD but I guess that's what you expect when you order four drinks and four items off of the menu. Totally worth every cent though. Yeah, it was. Music playing Hey hey hey bro! Clapping Whoo Hoo! Background Music So today is our very last day in Sofia and we've decided to try and cover some of the attractions we missed during the previous days. Right now we're visiting Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, which is absolutely massive Music playing Violins playing Sam wants monster pizza today. When there is a huge line like this you know it is worth the wait. Hahaha! Cheesy enough? Ah it's hot! Sam lives for pizza. Favorite food in the whole world. Right? Aaahaha that's sooo good. So big and cheesy. And just like that our adventure in Bulgaria is over. We're taking the overnight train to Istanbul. Istanbul! It's not... Constantinople it's not Istanbul Oh no...it's not Istanbul. Nice! You're messing me up. Jeez! So we tried feeding a dog pretzels. It didn't like them, so now we have a pigeon feasting on that instead. Hahahaha! It's such a fat pigeon.

We finally made it here and we are starting off in Senado Square. We're going to be exploring the area on foot and taking you along. Because this was a former Portuguese settlement all of the signs are in Portuguese and in Chinese. One of the first things I noticed about Macau are the very Portuguese tiles that they have and these black and white mosaic tiles can be found in Brazil and also in Portugal, so let's look at them. We're now here at the most distinct landmark in all of Macau - it is the Saint Paul ruins. Here I am taking refuge in the shade. I'm melting like a Popsicle. I can't believe people are actually jogging in this weather. Insanity! Right now we're just walking up Fortaleza do Monte which is a fortress on top of a hill overlooking the city. And it is super hot and it is super steep and we're sweating. Here we're taking aim at one of the biggest casinos. Here we've got our canon and a ball inside ready to blast. Which one are we blasting? That is the Grand Lisboa. The long climb up here was definitely worth it. Now we get some great views of the casinos and apartments below. Well, I've been to Macau one time before but this is your first time, so first impressions. First impressions, it reminds me a little bit of Las Vegas of course because of all of the casinos but it also has a bit of a Brazilian and a Portuguese flavor. It reminds me a lot of my visits to Rio and the food is great so I'm liking it so far. It is so ridiculously hot and humid outside. We've been literally subsisting off of these pearl milk teas. Another one, what do you mean? Another one. Refreshing. Today we're on a quest for Macanese food. We love to eat and we're always excited to try new things. Background music playing. So this little treat over here is called and it is a popular Portuguese pastry made with eggs. And I'm going to have my first bite. It's kind of Macanese food egg tart. Chinese and Portuguese inspired. How is it? It's nice and sweet and the egg is really fluffy. Almost like a souffle. What do got there? A piece of meat. Is it good? It's like bacon. So time for our second treat of the day. And we found a quiet little back alley away from some of the busy main pedestrian areas. And we've got some almond cakes here. These are also a Macanese specialty. Oh yeah, those are real good. They remind me of Christmas shortbread cookies that you have for the winter holidays. That sounds tasty. Melt in the mouth. Let's look at those again. Yum. Background music playing. So we're here at a local eatery just down a backstreet in Macau and we're here to try a pork chop bun and we've also been given a black soy milk drink, so we'll see what that is all about. Okay, first I'm trying soy milk in my whole life. Mmmm is it sweet? This is sweet, yeah. Does it have a kind of a rich flavor? I don't know. You try it. Yeah, it definitely tastes like sweetened soy milk. A little bit similar to almond milk as well. I can also taste the black bean a little bit too. Background music playing. Time to try this famous pork chop bun here in Macau. Mmmmmm. That's really nice. Is it? It's a soft warm bun fresh out of the oven. I think it may have some butter. And the pork is just so flavorful. Save some for me. No. So it's starting to get really hot outside so we treated ourselves to a nice little pearl tea. Um, I think the origins of this are actually Taiwanese but it's really popular here in Macau, so we're adding it to the video. Background music playing. Background music playing. We got so bored staying in China that we decided to change things up. Now we're in Venice, Italy. Actually we just crossed the street from our hotel in Macau and now we're visiting the Venetian. So we're still in China. Background music playing. So even if you're not a huge gambler there is still plenty to do in Cotai Central here in Macau. There are so many hotels that you can visit and every hotel usually has a unique show that they put on. Here at the Venetian you can ride the Gondola and just feel like you're in Italy for an afternoon. Then the hotel we were staying at was having some kind of Shrek parade which you missed out on. I did miss it but Sam loved it. Oh wow, yes! There is just lots of shows and different performances that you can attend in the evenings. So plenty to do aside from gambling. Coming early in the morning was a really good idea. We basically almost have this whole place to ourselves. background music playing. Well, Macau is a place where dreams come true. You make a little wish and throw your coin into the water. Being the high roller that I am. I've got a Macau ten cent piece here. Which I'm going to throw. Missed it. You missed it? Nice. And of course 1 baht. what? Great camera work on the coin toss. I got the splash at the end. The after splash. Background music playing. Background music playing. So we just got on the ferry. We are traveling from Macau to Hong Kong. We had tickets with Turbo Jet and the cool thing is that if you show up early you can on standby and if there is room on the ferry you just hop on board. Yeah, and we got on and we are taking the hydrofoil. This is going to be a fast high speed ride that should only take forty five minutes to an hour. Background music playing. This Turbo Jet is a high performance gazelle. I'm not having fun. High performance gazelle. We're bouncing up and down. Background music playing. And why are you filling in my Immigration card? Because Sam can't really write. It looks like chicken scratch. Hahaha! This is the truth. It's a true story. Background music playing. The seas are really choppy today so we're treating my seasickness with a cup of noodle soup. It seems to be a cure all for every problem we have. Food! background music playing.",False,20140911 - Things to do in Macau Travel Guide & Macanese Street Food.en.srt

This week we're in the Finnish capital and we are going to be showing you some of the top attractions you should check out in the summertime. With its long days and short nights, summertime is a great time to be in Helsinki. This was our second visit to the Finnish capital, and we were excited as ever to experience it for a couple of days. With summer in full swing, we enjoyed dinners al fresco, boat trips to nearby islands, and lots of walking around town. Here's a look at how we spent our time in Helsinki: One of our favorite things about being in Helsinki were all the street performances taking place. Esplanade Park hosted several concerts, which were free to the public. Right now we're going to be visiting one of the most famous landmarks in all of Helsinki. This is Helsinki Cathedral and what is really cool about this church is that it is very different from other churches across Europe. Most European churches are very elaborate. They have a lot of paintings inside; however, once we go inside this church you are going to see that it is very simple, very white, very clean and it is just looks like a blank canvas. Helsinki Cathedral overlooks Senate Square, so after you visit the church, you can sit down on the steps and watch people go by. This is a very exciting moment for me here in Helsinki. I'm an enormous Salmiakki fan, which is black salty licorice. It is extremely salty and this particular kiosk here is famous because it sells over 91 different varieties of Salmiakki products. Okay, so what did you order from the kiosk? I've got my favorite kind of Salmiakki product - Salmiakki ice cream. It is like the best of both worlds. It is very salty, it has a very strong licorice taste and it is of course ice cream. Who doesn't like ice cream? And the coolest part here is that it is actually shaped like a Salmiakki candy. It has that exact shape. Mmmm. That is so good. What we're about to show you is called dinner in the sky. And you're going to see some people sitting up on a table just hanging from a crane. Look for yourself. Market square is a great place to pick up fresh vegetables and berries, and you can also try a number of traditional Finnish dishes ranging from grilled salmon to reindeer meatballs. We frequented the market almost daily, and at 10 Euros a meal, we thought it was a budget-friendly option for travelers. So it is now time for lunch and we've stopped off at Market Square - one of my favorite places to grab a really tasty and cheap meal. Today we are having grilled salmon, potatoes and vegetables. And yeah, let's go enjoy this before it gets too cold. Alright, hungry boy. Ready for the first bite? It is time for some salmon. I never get tired of eating salmon. If I lived here I'd probably be eating this daily. So now that we're finished eating we're going to show you the more crafty side of Market Square. This is a great place to pickup some traditional Finnish products and souvenirs to take back home. Helsinki has a thriving design district and I really enjoyed visiting various shops which showcased the best of Scandinavian design. My favourite was, of course, Marimekko which is renowned for its bold patterns and bright colours. Right now I'm in the Marimekko store, which is one of the most famous design stores in all of Finland. Finland has a unique tradition where people come and wash their carpets on floating docks by the sea. The carpets are then left to dry overnight without fear of anyone stealing them. After washing your carpets it is a great area where you can just go and grab a drink and relax. Up next we're visiting the Kamppi Chapel of silence. This chapel is located in one of the busiest areas of Helsinki and it is supposed to be a place where anyone can drop by and just enjoy a moment of silence. No services are held in this church but they do have clergy and social workers on hand if anyone needs to speak with them. Me. Traveller. So Sam, do you think one day you'll be able to grow an impressive beard like Santa's? Never. It looks like peachy fuzz. That I glued onto my face. Helsinki has a number of unique landmarks and attractions. One of them being this church carved out of a rock. And what is really cool about it is that this church has amazing acoustics so it is actually a very popular concert hall. The roof consists of a copper dome surrounded by a skylight, which allows natural light to stream into the building. During one of our afternoons in Helsinki, we hopped aboard the Helsinki Sightseeing cruise. The trip was an hour and a half in length, and we got to see the various islands that make up the city's archipelago. It was a beautiful sunny day with blue skies, and we saw a lot of sailboats out on the water. It is a beautiful day to be outdoors today and we are all geared up to go on a bike ride. We are going to be taking a tour of Helsinki. How is it going so far? I'm getting a workout here. You look really silly with your ball cap and a helmet on. Come on, I'm starting a new fashion trend over here. This is what is considered cool these days. Oh, really? No, definitely not. But what is cool is that just getting outside of Helsinki, a few kilometers, and you're out right in the woods. This is amazing. Let's do a 360. So we just finished our four hour long bike ride around Helsinki and next up we are going kayaking. Right now it is nine PM and it is still bright out and I think we're supposed to be back at midnight. So let's go. Normally, I like to do a single kayak because I don't really trust Sam on the water but I've been talked into this double kayak for newlywed couples. Teamwork. Teamwork. Except, I'm the only one paddling because you're sitting back there filming. Yep, that's about right. Enjoy a few beers in the back of the double kayak. Yeah, I'll just have the beers, sit back and let her do all of the work. Right, Audrey? Oh, hush you. Paddle. Paddle faster. Argh. No, don't make it wobble. I'm going to tip it over. Wobble. Wobble. Wobble. Wobble. Sam, that is not. Sam. Okay, stop it. It is eleven thirty now and we are paddling back home in the dark. With nothing but the moon and our lights to guide us. This is a city that comes alive during the summer months, and it was great enjoying all the events taking place in the city as well as relaxing outdoors. We loved revisiting Helsinki and we discovered so many new places that we had completely skipped over the first time around. Have you been to Helsinki? Let us know about your experiences in the comments below. We're here in Finland today and we're going to be trying Salmiakki. Now for those of you who are not very familiar with this it is a salty black licorice. We actually got to try it last year when we visited and I hated it but Sam loved it. I think our reactions are going to be a bit predictable. Now today we have six different kinds of Salmiakki so let's get started. The special ingredient of Salmiakki is ammonium chloride and that is what gives it its salty and very overpowering taste. Oh boy, this is a real treat. This is a Salmiakki ice cream and we decided well we better eat this first before it actually melts. Let's open it up and it is from Fazer. From Fazer brand which is a really popular brand in Finland especially for chocolate but it is also really popular for Salmiakki as well. Okay. That is hilarious. What is funny about this is that it is basically shaped like a Salmiakki candy would be. So it has got...yeah. It looks quite authentic here. Let's have the first bite. That is the best salmiakki I've ever had. In ice cream form it is a lot sweeter and it still has got all of that overpowering salmiakki taste. I just love this. I'm going to eat the whole thing. I guess now it is my turn. I'm kind of hoping the middle is vanilla flavored. Yummy yummy? Urgh. No. Um. It is not as bad as the candies I've had before but it still has a really strong Salmiakki taste and I mean the ice cream is actually a bit salty which I don't think should be the case with ice cream. I'm giving it the thumbs down unfortunately. That one didn't last very long. Next up we've got Fazer Super Salmiakki and this of the candy variety. Let's open this one up. And already I can tell - I've tried other Salmiakki candies but this one feels a lot harder, so I have a feeling it is going to be a bit different. It is not going to be as chewy. Let's give this a shot. Okay, so you can definitely taste the Salmiakki here. It is very strong. As I expected, it is a hard candy and it is not very chewy. I think it is a really great type of Salmiakki product you take with you maybe when you're driving in a car or something. You can just pop one in your mouth and it will last quite a while. Just let is sit and roll around on your tongue. I guess it is my turn to give it a go. Oh, the excitement! How much longer do I have to taste it before? Put the whole thing in your mouth. It is like really salty. Saltier than the ice cream. It tastes like horrible medicine. There is nothing redeeming about it. Yeah. Spitting sounds. I'm actually not entirely sure what this Salmiakki product is. These look like maybe more kind of a sugary type of rolls. This should be interesting. Let's try these. I've never had them. Kind of neat. They've got a brown filing. Mmmm. Okay, yeah. These are chewy and really sweet and these are more like your type of traditional candy I guess. You really taste the sugar along with the Salmiakki. Which is strong but it is not nearly as strong as the harder candy. So I'm still recovering from the last one but since these are super sweet and covered in sugar, I figured I'd give it a go. A little nibble. I'm not sure what the middle part is. It is brown. Coffee maybe? No it isn't. No. Urgh! Have it! Hahaha! You can have it! Okay, so as not to torture Audrey, she can be exempt from these next two things that I'm going to try. I'm just going to make her try the chocolate. Next up we've got Salmiakki in a box and we're going to try a different brand here. I believe it is called Halva. Let's try that. Whoops. They just fell out. Okay. I can tell right now these are really hard. Hard salmiakki type things. Let's have a look at them. Can you see them there? See, that is what the ice cream cone was shaped like. Just like this. So I'm going to put them both in. Those are really hard and small. They are similar to the ones I got from the Fazer bag from the first one that I tried. But yeah, they are really strong and again like kind of just slowly dissolve in your mouth. You can just kind of chew on them or just let them roll around on your tongue. And they are long lasting, so. I think the best thing about them is that they come in this little package here, so you could just like walk around with them in your pant pocket and be like hey I feel like some Salmiakki and just whip it out and have a bite. Alright, next up we've got the mixed bag of Salmiakki and this is also from Fazer. As you can see from on the back of the package there is all of the different shapes and sizes. Let's open that up. There we go. You know what - I'm just going to dump a whole bunch of these on here so we can kind of see what they look like. And I'm going to just start trying one of each. This is a different one. This one is different. Okay, so I've got four in my mouth right now and yeah they really are different. Some of them are little bit larger and more chewy and then the other ones are hard and they are kind of similar to the ones that you can get like the pocket sized ones. They are hard and you kind of have to suck on them a bit longer but yeah this is for Salmiakki lovers. This has got it all. You've got all shapes and sizes here. And last but certainly not least we've got Salmiakki in chocolate form. And much like the ice cream I have very high expectations for this. I hope it is going to be sweet and chocolate-y and just overall delicious. Let's open this. Okay. From the outside, as you can see, it looks just sort of like your normal milk chocolate bar but let's break it off here and see if we can see if it is any different. Okay, it still looks normal to me. Mmmmmm. Oh, it is so good. Like it is just amazing. Like, chocolate is stellar. Salmiakki is stellar. Putting them together is just an awesome combination. This is just as good as like chocolate and peanut butter as far as I'm concerned. Okay, I'm going to show this part. And here you can see it is sort of like stuffed inside of the milk chocolate the same way a caramel milk chocolate might be like or if you had come to Canada or the US and you have like the peanut butter milk chocolate. How it is just kind of like in the middle and it is in a bit of a creamy form. Two thumbs up for this product. Alright, well, I do like the Karl Fazer chocolate bars. I have been eating them every single day since I've been back. I'm not so sure about the Salmiakki. I'll try a little corner. Hey, that is not right. The salmiakki is in the middle. You have to take a bite right in the middle. Come on. Last bite. It is like eating chocolate that has been stuffed with medicine and salt. I mean the chocolate is great and it kind of helps mask the Salmiakki taste but I'd rather have a plain chocolate bar. Alright, to sum of all of this up. I liked every single Salmiakki thing tried; however, there were things I liked more than others. My top two, were of course, the ice cream and the chocolate bar because I also have a sweet tooth and combining salmiakki with milk chocolate and ice cream. That is just amazing. Okay, next up I do really like these ones too. These like. These candies that are a bit more sweet than the other ones. So I rank those really highly. So among the more I guess traditional hard candies like these ones would be great to carry with you in your pocket. Although I do prefer the ones that are a little chewier so this is just more portable. And amongst these two I would have to say I'll go with the mixed bag. So everything is awesome. If you're in Finland you absolutely have to try this. It is the kind of polarizing thing. You're probably either going to love it or hate it. And most foreigners who - especially those who haven't tried liquorice before - are probably not going to like it. I love it this stuff, so if you don't finish your bag or your chocolate bar or your ice cream you know where to send it. Surprise, surprise, surprise! We are back in Finland almost one year to the day that we left. This is awesome. This is one of my favorite countries in all of Europe. Most people when they arrive sometimes they go and freshen up. They might splash a little water on their faces or maybe go to the washroom after a long nine hour flight. But no. What is the first thing that I do - get my Salmiakki candy. I've been craving this for over a year and I've already ate half of the bag and I'm having even more now. So good! What we're about to show you is called dinner in the sky. You are going to see some people sitting up on a table, just hanging from a crane. Look for yourself! The port area or market square appears to be even bigger and busier than last time year. It is just bustling with activity and there is a Ferris Wheel right over there. A bit hot and tired are we? Oh my gosh, so sweaty and tired. I need a shower and a bed. And you know what - this is easily the hottest day we've ever experienced in Finland. Yes. It is over thirty. We're back in jail. We stayed here last year. We did. Let's check out the room. Come on in. This room here used to be a jail cell which explains why the windows are so high up, so the prisoners couldn't escape. Also, they have really thick curtains here in Finland and that is because during the summer the sun just stays up a really long time. You wouldn't be able to sleep otherwise. We're back in Finland on an eight day adventure and we plan on shooting a daily vlog. Basically what we want to do is just show you exactly what we're doing and what it is like to be in Finland in the summer - both in the city and outside in the countryside doing more adventure types of activities. We just arrived at Lonna Island. This used to be a former military island and it has just opened to the public this summer, so we're going to check it out. It was a really cool meal. We had grilled fish and potatoes. And that is just like the quintessential Finnish summer meal. It's our first full day in Finland and it is finally breakfast time. We actually woke up at two thirty in the morning because we were jet lagged and then the sun slowly started coming up at like four thirty in the morning. We've been waiting for this for a long time. Someone is hungry. Yes. That was a really filling breakfast. I think we're both just stuffed. We're going to go on a very small walk around jail hotel and show you the sites. They have a really cool little garden where it appears they're growing their own vegetables. It is a beautiful day to be outdoors today and we are all geared up to go on a bike ride. We are going to be taking a tour of Helsinki. How is it going so far? Oh, I'm getting a workout here. You look really silly with your ball cap and helmet on top. Come on, I'm starting a new fashion trend over here. This is what is considered cool these days. Oh really? No, definitely not. But what is cool is that just getting outside of Helsinki, a few kilometers, you're out right in the woods. This is amazing. Let's do a 360. We just finished our four hour long bike ride around Helsinki and next up we're going kayaking. Right now it is nine PM. It is still bright out and I think we're supposed to be back at midnight, so let's go. Normally I like to do a single kayak because I don't really trust Sam on the water but I've been talked into this double kayak for newlywed couples. Teamwork. Except, I'm the only one paddling because you're sitting back there filming. Yep, that's about right. Enjoy a few beers in the back of the double kayak. Yep, I'll just have the beers, sit back and let her do all of the work. Right, Audrey? Oh, hush. Paddle. Paddle faster. Argh. No, don't make it wobble. I'm going to tip it over. Wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble. Sam! That is not. Okay, stop it. It is eleven thirty now and we are paddling back home in the dark with nothing but the moon and our lights to guide us. It is day three in Finland and today we are going for a walk in the woods. We're here at Nuuksio National Park. On today's outing we learned about Every Man's Right in Finland. This is a traditional Finnish concept that allows people to camp out freely, to pick berries and mushrooms in the wild, to fish with a rod and line, and to walk, cycle, or ski anywhere on the land. To sum it up, Every Man's Right means that everyone is free to enjoy the land. Where are you right now? Right now I'm in a woodshed and what is really cool is that the Finnish government provides wood for all of the National Parks. You can go out and make a fire here. Har! Har! Except, you don't have any firewood. After hiking for a while, we cooked some sausages and enjoyed some sandwiches by the lake. It was a great way to spend a summer afternoon in Finland. And we're kayaking again today. It is eight o'clock right now. It is calm. It is peaceful outside. It is still very light and we have the golden rays of the sun shining down on the water. Today is day four of our Finnish adventure and we are going to be going horseback riding. Now let's go meet our Icelandic horses. What makes Icelandic horses different is that they have very gentle characters. Also, while they may be smaller in stature, they are actually very strong horses. We're making our first stop of the morning. We're visiting a local flea market. In here it is a mix of antiques, dishware and clothes. That was a lot of fun. My horse, Farri, turned out to be a really hungry boy. He just kept stopping for grass and for flowers along the way but we got to see the countryside and I really enjoyed it. A cool fact that we've learned while in Finland is that there is thirteen thousand trees for every Finn. That is a lot of trees. Finland's archipelago is made up of thousands of little islands, so one of the best ways to get around is by boat. Our guide took us out to visit a former military island which is now home to little summer cottages. We had a cute German pointer join us, keeping us entertained. We are now on an island called Bolax and this used to be a former military island. Now we have a special guide with us and he is going to take us inside an old canon. Let's go climb in. Along the way we got to see sailboat races and a nesting ospreys. Okay, Sam what are you having today? Salmiakki! Salmiakki! I'm going to down it. One shot. One shot. Oh, that is awesome. What does it taste like Sam? Just like Salmiakki. Sam-iakki. This is shot number three. This is shot number three and it is going down in one blast. Watch this. Oh, so yummy. Is there a forth one? That is amazing. That is so good. There you go. Are you serious? Is it better than the sweets? Why not? Sam, is it better than the sweets? My liver just flipped. Another bottle for Sam? I've got to go to the washroom. Day five in Finland. This morning we're taking a speed boat from Kasnas to Hanko. Ready for some adventure guys? Yeah! Yes! Finland's archipelago region, which is part of the Baltic Sea, is home to thousands of small islands. The rib boat was a fun way to experience the natural scenery of this area. Plus it got us to the port town of Hanko in record time. Woo! We just arrived here in Hanko and we've picked up our Sun Fun bikes and we're going to go on a little tour of the city. Hanko is a small town that sits on the shores of the Baltic Sea, and it also happens to be the southernmost point in all of Finland. This is a popular summer destination, where Finns rent villas by the sea. Everything about the town felt laid-back and relaxed. Our afternoon in Hanko was spent doing a little bit of hiking and plenty of biking past ponds, through forests, and along the beach. So you just made some new friends! Bah bah! I'm just hanging out with my new friends here the sheep. We're visiting a farm and I guess what we're going to be doing here is selecting some ingredients - some vegetables and different things - and we're going to be cooking our own meal tonight. Oh, yes! So neither of us realized this is actually an electric fence and we both just got zapped. That's an electric fence. We just finished our bike ride where we got to visit a few local farms and now we're going to be cooking a meal with all of those local ingredients. Let's go to the kitchen. Peeling time. I'm in charge of potatoes. Don't eat all of my whip cream. I said one bite because you want to be in the video. Mmmm, one more. One more. That's so mean. Alright, so this is day six in Finland and this morning we are going to try stand up paddle boarding. Apparently, this is a sport that has been around since the 60's but it has only become really popular in the last three years. I've never done this before so I hope my balance is really good. And if there is one person that is most likely to fall in it is definitely me. I would agree. Fingers crossed. Our guide attempted teaching us to paddle both the Hawaiian and the Tahitian way, but most of us were concerned about not falling in to the waters of the chilly Baltic Sea. Okay, Mr. Wobble Wobble are you ready? I bet I'm going to be the only one who actually falls in. Like a cat on the water. Worse than a cat on the water. Okay, Sam is going to attempt standing up. Let's see how this goes. Oh, it looks like he's got it. Our first time stand up paddle boarding turned out to be a lot of fun, and we were lucky to have calm waters to practice. Audrey was a natural. I on the other hand, had a little trouble dismounting. Hahaha! Oh my gosh. Did you get it on film? That is not the best way. Dock fail. When in Finland you absolutely have to experience a sauna. Apparently, there are five million Finns and three million saunas. We're going to go in and try one. I absolutely love the sauna. When I lived in Korea I used to go almost weekly, so this is going to be a lot of fun. Okay, let's go in. Finnish sauna is typically enjoyed naked with friends and family, but we kept it PG13 for you guys. You're welcome! We were hoping to do a Finnish chocolates and candy bar while we were in Finland but unfortunately we ran out of time. So we're now back at home in Canada and we're just sitting in my backyard and today we are going to be taste testing all of this candy. It should be a fun afternoon. And we've got Max, the dog, to join us. Max, do you want chocolate? Chocolates! He's like - where is the steak? Where is the sausage? First off we are starting with this little Jim bar. And we've never had this one before. No, let's see what it tastes like. It is very small. For a healthy snack. Mmmm. Oh, it is white inside. It has a very fruity flavor but I can't really make out what kinds of fruit are in here. Banana, perhaps? It is really nice. I like it. Okay, so I'm a huge fan of licorice and I've had a lot of Salmiakki since I've been in Finland but this is something I've never tried. This is called Lakupala and it is Tropico. Apparently, there is dark chocolate, orange, berries and possibly pineapple. So I have a feeling this is going to be sweet liquorice. I have no idea. I'm opening it up. You can see the different colors. So here is one that is white. Let's guess the flavors. Okay. So without looking at the bag, what do you think that one is? I think that is pineapple. And it is really sweet. This is definitely candy kind of licorice with a lot of sugar but I like it. Audrey hates licorice but maybe we can finally find something that she likes. Maybe this fruit flavored licorice will win her over. Okay, I'm purposely going to choose the red berries because I like berry flavored stuff, so maybe I'll be able to enjoy this. Did you spit it out? Uhhhh. And no more licorice for Audrey. That would just be cruel for me to force her to try more of it - especially the Salmiakki. Okay, so next up for me is the Tupla bar. Also, this is a bar we've never had as well. So I was reading up on this chocolate bar and apparently Tupla means double because you get two little bars inside of the package. This one looks like it got a little bit crushed. Okay, so it is milk chocolate and nuts on the exterior. And then I think the filling might be nougat. It is kind of chewy and very sugary. Yeah, I do like this one. It is really nice. Audrey was kind enough to share the second one with me so I'm going to try this for the first time. I wasn't kind enough to share - I think you stole it. A guy has got to do what a guy has got to do. You're right, this is a really chewy chocolate bar and very sweet. I do like it though. Mmmmm. Before we became travel bloggers and started making YouTube travel and food videos, we used to teach English in South Korea. And our students were obsessed with Angry Birds. Like they just loved that game. Angry birds originated from Finland and they have a little candy bar here. I think it might be licorice. Let's show us the Angry bird. It is a yellow Angry Bird. There they are. It looks quite angry doesn't it? Alright, let's try this Angry Bird candy. Indeed, it is licorice and it appears to be filled with something. Okay, yeah, it is a very sugary licorice that I'm sure kids would love. And yes it is pineapple flavored inside. Kids and Sam love it. Here I have Moomin gummy bears. So if you're not too familiar with Moomins, they're actually characters from a Finnish fairy tale and they kind of look like Hippos, right? I think it looks like a hippo, yeah. They're just big plump, white creatures and while we were in Helsinki they were celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of the creator of the Moomins, so Moomins were all over the city. These are gummy's. Let's see. Are they shaped like Moomin? Yeah, let's see. This one looks like a Moomin. And there is some people in there as well. I'm not sure what the story is with these guys but they must all be characters. I'll try this one. Mmmm. Maybe apple? Is it sweet? Yeah. These are really good. I think I'll be keeping these for myself since I don't like the licorice, I won't share these. No Finnish taste test video would be complete without testing Salmiakki. This is a treat that is absolutely adored in Finland but a lot of foreigners don't like it. It is extremely salty. It is made with Ammonium Chloride. It is like a black type of licorice except it is so much saltier than any kind of licorice I've ever had. I love it. Audrey really doesn't like it, so I'm not forcing her to have any. And I'm just going to show you what it looks like. Now, this is one kind of Salmiakki you can get. These are the smaller ones and they are kind of harder candies. So you just them in your mouth and you suck on them. Mmmmm. I'm in my happy place right now. So next up we have some Jenkki spearmint gum. So I actually have a few Finnish Canadian friends and whenever they come back from Finland this is what they bring back. I've actually had this several times before in Canada. Let's see. But I like it, so I'm happy to try it again for the video. Jenkki! Let's see what it looks like. It's gum. It tastes like your average gum. It's not a super overpowering flavor like some of the Excel gums but yeah this one is nice. Aside from Salmiakki, my next favorite Finnish food is Karl Fazer chocolate. And this is just amazing high quality chocolate. I think this one we have here is just the plan milk chocolate one. This is your standard Karl Fazer chocolate bar. And I recommend if you're going to eat this get the big bar. This is just the little tiny one. Those big massive 200 gram bars - those are the best. It is just so creamy and delicious and I like that sure it is sugary but it is not too sugary. That is a big difference between European and American chocolate is that there is more creaminess and richness to European chocolate whereas American chocolate is really sugary. So this stuff is way better. Here is a unique one. While we were in the supermarket looking for different chocolate bars we could try we came across Karl Fazer bar but as you can see over here this one is Chili and Crisps. So I've never had chocolate with chili before. We'll what that actually tastes like. I'm expecting to like it. I wonder if it is spicy or not? Yeah. It'll be interesting to see. I hope it is not too too spicy. Hopefully you won't spit it out like the licorice. I mean it must be a good combination for Karl Fazer to produce this. I'm still not tasting the chili. Are you biting into it? Um hmm. Maybe it is just very mildly flavored. I'm waiting for it to kick in. There is something crunchy in there for sure. Okay, actually when you swallow the chocolate there is a slight burn in your throat. I think there is a chili. I'm going to let you try it and see what you think. Alright, I'm going to have two pieces here to try and make sure we can find that chili inside. Yeah, you're right. It is not initially spicy. It does have that crunch though. I think you'll feel it when you swallow the chocolate. Tell me how that feels. Okay, a little bit of a burn but not much. I mean this is very tame. This is very tame. I'm very excited about the licorice all sorts. I grew up eating these in Canada, so I wonder if they taste the same or not. Alright, and so with the all sorts it really is just a whole bunch of different licorice candies. So I'm just going to hold them out in my hand as you can see here. These yellow ones tend to be sweeter. Let's see how this tastes. Mmm. Let's try one of each in the name of research. Yeah, that is very sweet. What is the yellow one flavored like? They are not actually flavored like the colors that they are. They're just kind of sweet. Alright, one more. Yeah, those are really good. I mean they're just as good as any of the ones I've tried in Canada and I can tell that these are ones are really fresh, so I like them a lot. The best way to describe the licorice all sorts. Some of them are more sugary, some of them have more of a licorice taste, some of them are more chewy, so you've just got to grab a whole bunch of them, taste them one by one and see which one you like the most. And I saved one of my favorites for last - this is the Geisha chocolate bar which is also produced by Karl Fazer. Let's try this. I wish Karl Fazer would make his way over to Canada. I know. We really need him over here. Mmmm. That is really nice. So yeah, this one is a milk chocolate and it has a creamy hazelnut filling. Perfection. It is my favorite one, so I'm always happy to eat a Geisha bar. So that concludes our Finnish taste test. Let us know if you've tried any Finnish chocolates, licorice, gummy bears or Salmiakki. We're curious to know. For more food and travel videos hit subscribe.",False,20140904 - Our Visit Finland Outdoors Adventure ∩╝Ü Finland Travel Guide & Finnish Cuisine.en.srt

We've picked up a few more people who are joining us and we've already picked up some local buddies who will be walking with us it seems. Today's hike is going to be divided into three sections and the first village that we will be visiting is called Lao Chai. It's about eight kilometers from where we started out and we're two kilometers into the trek so far. It is getting really hot and I'm sweaty so let's keep going. Tell us about the scenery? Unbelievable. Everywhere we walk. So as you can see over here there is a bit of a landslide that is blocking the road into the town. I thought I heard a waterfall down there. It turns out it is just a river. It is still impressive. So after several kilometers of hiking we're finally approaching the village of Lao Chai down below. So we are about to cross this bridge into town and it is not for those who have vertigo because there are railings on this bridge. After two hours of hiking we've reached our first destination point Lao Chai Village. It is time for lunch and I'm pretty hungry. How about you? I'm starving. I can't wait to get there fast enough. It is just over there where the bridge is. That is Lao Chai. We are going to continue our trekking journey. We just finished eating lunch in Lao Chai and next up we're going to a place called Ta Van. That is meant to be three kilometers away. So we are walking through the town of Lao Chai and people are just going about their daily business. They are herding ducks down the street and there are men working the fields with their water buffaloes. Friendly kids running around playing. Yes. Sam wants to live here. I do. You can see these rice terraces in the mountains and you can also see them right in the towns. Okay, cowboy. More postcard worthy views from over here. We are taking the scenic route and right now we're just walking past some rice fields where people are working the crops. I think these next three kilometers are going to be worse than the eight kilometers we previously did. Earlier we were walking down hill. Oh come on, this is the reward. We're climbing up terraces. Look at all the kids up there. Those little kids up there were throwing rocks down at us. So a status update. How are you feeling now? Uh. And your legs. Uh. She is a city gal from Toronto. And here we've got butterflies feasting on poo. So the village that we are staying in for the night. There is a bigger duck population than there are people and we have lots of friendly cats. We are here. Full of zest and energy? Made it. Ta Van. The village of Ta Van. What have we got under here? A little cat hiding. So we've arrived here in Ta Van and this is where we're going to be sleeping. Home stay time. It's like camping. So this is our second day of the hike. We're heading to our third village and then afterwards when we finish we're taking a bus back to Sapa and then this evening we're taking a train to Hanoi, so we've got a really busy day. Well now that it is day two I can say with absolute certainty this is the most scenic hike I've ever taken in my whole life. Anyone who visits Vietnam definitely make time to go on this type of hike. It is phenomenal. So right now we've got a bit of shady reprieve. We're walking through the bamboo forest. Quite tired at this point and the terrain is getting really muddy. I just wore flip flops. Owe! Something bit me! Oh my gosh and there is the largest spider I've seen in my life. Where? So what just happened there? There is fresh shit for us to hop over. This pretty much wraps up our hiking tour here in the Northwestern part of Vietnam. It was a great experience but also very tiring. We are staying in a mountainside town of Sapa. We've been here two days now and today we woke up bright and early at 5:30 in the morning and now it is about 7:30. We are heading on a hike to Cat Cat Village. Hello. Okay. Cheong. We have arrived at Cat Cat Village now. It is located I guess at the base of the mountain or in the valley, so we are just walking down hill enjoying the views. Well someone has walked away with a new souvenir. What is the meaning of this? I sure have. My new four dollar cowboy hat. You are like Vietnam's Indian Jones. Yeah. As you know. I'm a man of many hats. We've been walking around for about an hour an and half. It has almost been straight downhill, so now we've decided to head back and we are going to be walking uphill the whole way. I'm not sure we have the energy to get back. I'll be fine. We may have to live in Cat Cat Village forever. Yeah, I think it would be a great place for you to live. Excellent, we'll be farmers.",False,20140901 - Things to do in Sapa Vietnam ∩╜£ Top Attractions Travel Guide For A Trekking Adventure in Sapa!.en.srt

Okay, so I'm a huge fan of licorice and I've had a lot of Salmiakki since I've been in Finland but this is something I've never tried. This is called Lakupala and it is Tropico. Apparently, there is dark chocolate, orange, berries and possibly pineapple. So I have a feeling this is going to be sweet liquorice. I have no idea. I'm opening it up. You can see the different colors. So here is one that is white. Let's guess the flavors. Okay. So without looking at the bag, what do you think that one is? I think that is pineapple. And it is really sweet. This is definitely candy kind of licorice with a lot of sugar but I like it. Audrey hates licorice but maybe we can finally find something that she likes. Maybe this fruit flavored licorice will win her over. Okay, I'm purposely going to choose the red berries because I like berry flavored stuff, so maybe I'll be able to enjoy this. Did you spit it out? Uhhhh. And no more licorice for Audrey. That would just be cruel for me to force her to try more of it - especially the Salmiakki. Okay, so next up for me is the Tupla bar. Also, this is a bar we've never had as well. So I was reading up on this chocolate bar and apparently Tupla means double because you get two little bars inside of the package. This one looks like it got a little bit crushed. Okay, so it is milk chocolate and nuts on the exterior. And then I think the filling might be nougat. It is kind of chewy and very sugary. Yeah, I do like this one. It is really nice. Audrey was kind enough to share the second one with me so I'm going to try this for the first time. I wasn't kind enough to share - I think you stole it. A guy has got to do what a guy has got to do. You're right, this is a really chewy chocolate bar and very sweet. I do like it though. Mmmmm. Before we became travel bloggers and started making YouTube travel and food videos, we used to teach English in South Korea. And our students were obsessed with Angry Birds. Like they just loved that game. Angry birds originated from Finland and they have a little candy bar here. I think it might be licorice. Let's show us the Angry bird. It is a yellow Angry Bird. There they are. It looks quite angry doesn't it? Alright, let's try this Angry Bird candy. Indeed, it is licorice and it appears to be filled with something. Okay, yeah, it is a very sugary licorice that I'm sure kids would love. And yes it is pineapple flavored inside. Kids and Sam love it. Here I have Moomin gummy bears. So if you're not too familiar with Moomins, they're actually characters from a Finnish fairy tale and they kind of look like Hippos, right? I think it looks like a hippo, yeah. They're just big plump, white creatures and while we were in Helsinki they were celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of the creator of the Moomins, so Moomins were all over the city. These are gummy's. Let's see. Are they shaped like Moomin? Yeah, let's see. This one looks like a Moomin. And there is some people in there as well. I'm not sure what the story is with these guys but they must all be characters. I'll try this one. Mmmm. Maybe apple? Is it sweet? Yeah. These are really good. I think I'll be keeping these for myself since I don't like the licorice, I won't share these. No Finnish taste test video would be complete without testing Salmiakki. This is a treat that is absolutely adored in Finland but a lot of foreigners don't like it. It is extremely salty. It is made with Ammonium Chloride. It is like a black type of licorice except it is so much saltier than any kind of licorice I've ever had. I love it. Audrey really doesn't like it, so I'm not forcing her to have any. And I'm just going to show you what it looks like. Now, this is one kind of Salmiakki you can get. These are the smaller ones and they are kind of harder candies. So you just them in your mouth and you suck on them. Mmmmm. I'm in my happy place right now. So next up we have some Jenkki spearmint gum. So I actually have a few Finnish Canadian friends and whenever they come back from Finland this is what they bring back. I've actually had this several times before in Canada. Let's see. But I like it, so I'm happy to try it again for the video. Jenkki! Let's see what it looks like. It's gum. It tastes like your average gum. It's not a super overpowering flavor like some of the Excel gums but yeah this one is nice. Aside from Salmiakki, my next favorite Finnish food is Karl Fazer chocolate. And this is just amazing high quality chocolate. I think this one we have here is just the plan milk chocolate one. This is your standard Karl Fazer chocolate bar. And I recommend if you're going to eat this get the big bar. This is just the little tiny one. Those big massive 200 gram bars - those are the best. It is just so creamy and delicious and I like that sure it is sugary but it is not too sugary. That is a big difference between European and American chocolate is that there is more creaminess and richness to European chocolate whereas American chocolate is really sugary. So this stuff is way better. Here is a unique one. While we were in the supermarket looking for different chocolate bars we could try we came across Karl Fazer bar but as you can see over here this one is Chili and Crisps. So I've never had chocolate with chili before. We'll what that actually tastes like. I'm expecting to like it. I wonder if it is spicy or not? Yeah. It'll be interesting to see. I hope it is not too too spicy. Hopefully you won't spit it out like the licorice. I mean it must be a good combination for Karl Fazer to produce this. I'm still not tasting the chili. Are you biting into it? Um hmm. Maybe it is just very mildly flavored. I'm waiting for it to kick in. There is something crunchy in there for sure. Okay, actually when you swallow the chocolate there is a slight burn in your throat. I think there is a chili. I'm going to let you try it and see what you think. Alright, I'm going to have two pieces here to try and make sure we can find that chili inside. Yeah, you're right. It is not initially spicy. It does have that crunch though. I think you'll feel it when you swallow the chocolate. Tell me how that feels. Okay, a little bit of a burn but not much. I mean this is very tame. This is very tame. I'm very excited about the licorice all sorts. I grew up eating these in Canada, so I wonder if they taste the same or not. Alright, and so with the all sorts it really is just a whole bunch of different licorice candies. So I'm just going to hold them out in my hand as you can see here. These yellow ones tend to be sweeter. Let's see how this tastes. Mmm. Let's try one of each in the name of research. Yeah, that is very sweet. What is the yellow one flavored like? They are not actually flavored like the colors that they are. They're just kind of sweet. Alright, one more. Yeah, those are really good. I mean they're just as good as any of the ones I've tried in Canada and I can tell that these are ones are really fresh, so I like them a lot. The best way to describe the licorice all sorts. Some of them are more sugary, some of them have more of a licorice taste, some of them are more chewy, so you've just got to grab a whole bunch of them, taste them one by one and see which one you like the most. And I saved one of my favorites for last - this is the Geisha chocolate bar which is also produced by Karl Fazer. Let's try this. I wish Karl Fazer would make his way over to Canada. I know. We really need him over here. Mmmm. That is really nice. So yeah, this one is a milk chocolate and it has a creamy hazelnut filling. Perfection. It is my favorite one, so I'm always happy to eat a Geisha bar. So that concludes our Finnish taste test. Let us know if you've tried any Finnish chocolates, licorice, gummy bears or Salmiakki. We're curious to know. We're here in Finland today and we're going to be trying Salmiakki. Now for those of you who are not very familiar with this it is a salty black licorice. We actually got to try it last year when we visited and I hated it but Sam loved it. I think our reactions are going to be a bit predictable. Now today we have six different kinds of Salmiakki so let's get started. The special ingredient of Salmiakki is ammonium chloride and that is what gives it its salty and very overpowering taste. Oh boy, this is a real treat. This is a Salmiakki ice cream and we decided well we better eat this first before it actually melts. Let's open it up and it is from Fazer. From Fazer brand which is a really popular brand in Finland especially for chocolate but it is also really popular for Salmiakki as well. Okay. That is hilarious. What is funny about this is that it is basically shaped like a Salmiakki candy would be. So it has got...yeah. It looks quite authentic here. Let's have the first bite. That is the best salmiakki I've ever had. In ice cream form it is a lot sweeter and it still has got all of that overpowering salmiakki taste. I just love this. I'm going to eat the whole thing. I guess now it is my turn. I'm kind of hoping the middle is vanilla flavored. Yummy yummy? Urgh. No. Um. It is not as bad as the candies I've had before but it still has a really strong Salmiakki taste and I mean the ice cream is actually a bit salty which I don't think should be the case with ice cream. I'm giving it the thumbs down unfortunately. That one didn't last very long. Next up we've got Fazer Super Salmiakki and this of the candy variety. Let's open this one up. And already I can tell - I've tried other Salmiakki candies but this one feels a lot harder, so I have a feeling it is going to be a bit different. It is not going to be as chewy. Let's give this a shot. Okay, so you can definitely taste the Salmiakki here. It is very strong. As I expected, it is a hard candy and it is not very chewy. I think it is a really great type of Salmiakki product you take with you maybe when you're driving in a car or something. You can just pop one in your mouth and it will last quite a while. Just let is sit and roll around on your tongue. I guess it is my turn to give it a go. Oh, the excitement! How much longer do I have to taste it before? Put the whole thing in your mouth. It is like really salty. Saltier than the ice cream. It tastes like horrible medicine. There is nothing redeeming about it. Yeah. Spitting sounds. I'm actually not entirely sure what this Salmiakki product is. These look like maybe more kind of a sugary type of rolls. This should be interesting. Let's try these. I've never had them. Kind of neat. They've got a brown filing. Mmmm. Okay, yeah. These are chewy and really sweet and these are more like your type of traditional candy I guess. You really taste the sugar along with the Salmiakki. Which is strong but it is not nearly as strong as the harder candy. So I'm still recovering from the last one but since these are super sweet and covered in sugar, I figured I'd give it a go. A little nibble. I'm not sure what the middle part is. It is brown. Coffee maybe? No it isn't. No. Urgh! Have it! Hahaha! You can have it! Okay, so as not to torture Audrey, she can be exempt from these next two things that I'm going to try. I'm just going to make her try the chocolate. Next up we've got Salmiakki in a box and we're going to try a different brand here. I believe it is called Halva. Let's try that. Whoops. They just fell out. Okay. I can tell right now these are really hard. Hard salmiakki type things. Let's have a look at them. Can you see them there? See, that is what the ice cream cone was shaped like. Just like this. So I'm going to put them both in. Those are really hard and small. They are similar to the ones I got from the Fazer bag from the first one that I tried. But yeah, they are really strong and again like kind of just slowly dissolve in your mouth. You can just kind of chew on them or just let them roll around on your tongue. And they are long lasting, so. I think the best thing about them is that they come in this little package here, so you could just like walk around with them in your pant pocket and be like hey I feel like some Salmiakki and just whip it out and have a bite. Alright, next up we've got the mixed bag of Salmiakki and this is also from Fazer. As you can see from on the back of the package there is all of the different shapes and sizes. Let's open that up. There we go. You know what - I'm just going to dump a whole bunch of these on here so we can kind of see what they look like. And I'm going to just start trying one of each. This is a different one. This one is different. Okay, so I've got four in my mouth right now and yeah they really are different. Some of them are little bit larger and more chewy and then the other ones are hard and they are kind of similar to the ones that you can get like the pocket sized ones. They are hard and you kind of have to suck on them a bit longer but yeah this is for Salmiakki lovers. This has got it all. You've got all shapes and sizes here. And last but certainly not least we've got Salmiakki in chocolate form. And much like the ice cream I have very high expectations for this. I hope it is going to be sweet and chocolate-y and just overall delicious. Let's open this. Okay. From the outside, as you can see, it looks just sort of like your normal milk chocolate bar but let's break it off here and see if we can see if it is any different. Okay, it still looks normal to me. Mmmmmm. Oh, it is so good. Like it is just amazing. Like, chocolate is stellar. Salmiakki is stellar. Putting them together is just an awesome combination. This is just as good as like chocolate and peanut butter as far as I'm concerned. Okay, I'm going to show this part. And here you can see it is sort of like stuffed inside of the milk chocolate the same way a caramel milk chocolate might be like or if you had come to Canada or the US and you have like the peanut butter milk chocolate. How it is just kind of like in the middle and it is in a bit of a creamy form. Two thumbs up for this product. Alright, well, I do like the Karl Fazer chocolate bars. I have been eating them every single day since I've been back. I'm not so sure about the Salmiakki. I'll try a little corner. Hey, that is not right. The salmiakki is in the middle. You have to take a bite right in the middle. Come on. Last bite. It is like eating chocolate that has been stuffed with medicine and salt. I mean the chocolate is great and it kind of helps mask the Salmiakki taste but I'd rather have a plain chocolate bar. Alright, to sum of all of this up. I liked every single Salmiakki thing tried; however, there were things I liked more than others. My top two, were of course, the ice cream and the chocolate bar because I also have a sweet tooth and combining salmiakki with milk chocolate and ice cream. That is just amazing. Okay, next up I do really like these ones too. These like. These candies that are a bit more sweet than the other ones. So I rank those really highly. So among the more I guess traditional hard candies like these ones would be great to carry with you in your pocket. Although I do prefer the ones that are a little chewier so this is just more portable. And amongst these two I would have to say I'll go with the mixed bag. So everything is awesome. If you're in Finland you absolutely have to try this. It is the kind of polarizing thing. You're probably either going to love it or hate it. And most foreigners who - especially those who haven't tried liquorice before - are probably not going to like it. I love it this stuff, so if you don't finish your bag or your chocolate bar or your ice cream you know where to send it. This is a very exciting moment for me here in Helsinki. I'm an enormous Salmiakki fan, which is black salty licorice. It is extremely salty and this particular kiosk here is famous because it sells over 91 different varieties of Salmiakki products. Okay, so what did you order from Kiosk? I got my favorite kind of Salmiakki product - Salmiakki ice cream. It is like the best of both worlds. It is very salty. It has a very strong licorice taste and it is of course ice cream. Who doesn't like ice cream? And the coolest part here is that it is actually shaped like a Salmiakki candy. It has that exact shape. Mmmm. So good. It is now time for lunch and we stopped off at Market Square - one of my favorite places to grab a really tasty and cheap meal. Today we are having grilled salmon with potatoes and vegetables and yeah let's go enjoy this before it gets too cold. Alright, hungry boy are you ready for the first bite? It's time for some salmon. I never get tired of eating Salmon. If I lived here I'd probably be eating this daily. Okay, Sam what are you having today. Salmiakki. Salmiakki. Okay, I'm going to down this in one shot. One shot! Woah! Yeah! Oh, that is awesome! What does it taste like Sam? It tastes like Salmiakki. Sam-iakki. Samiakki. This is shot number three. This is shot number three and it is going down in one blast. Watch this. Is there a fourth one? That is amazing. That is so good. Here you go. Are you serious? A fourth shot. Why not? Sam, Sam. My liver just flipped. Let's wait for half an hour. Yum, yum, yum. I've got to go to the washroom.

This week we're in the Finnish capital and we are going to be showing you some of the top attractions you should check out in the summertime. With its long days and short nights, summertime is a great time to be in Helsinki. This was our second visit to the Finnish capital, and we were excited as ever to experience it for a couple of days. With summer in full swing, we enjoyed dinners al fresco, boat trips to nearby islands, and lots of walking around town. Here's a look at how we spent our time in Helsinki: One of our favorite things about being in Helsinki were all the street performances taking place. Esplanade Park hosted several concerts, which were free to the public. Right now we're going to be visiting one of the most famous landmarks in all of Helsinki. This is Helsinki Cathedral and what is really cool about this church is that it is very different from other churches across Europe. Most European churches are very elaborate. They have a lot of paintings inside; however, once we go inside this church you are going to see that it is very simple, very white, very clean and it is just looks like a blank canvas. Helsinki Cathedral overlooks Senate Square, so after you visit the church, you can sit down on the steps and watch people go by. This is a very exciting moment for me here in Helsinki. I'm an enormous Salmiakki fan, which is black salty licorice. It is extremely salty and this particular kiosk here is famous because it sells over 91 different varieties of Salmiakki products. Okay, so what did you order from the kiosk? I've got my favorite kind of Salmiakki product - Salmiakki ice cream. It is like the best of both worlds. It is very salty, it has a very strong licorice taste and it is of course ice cream. Who doesn't like ice cream? And the coolest part here is that it is actually shaped like a Salmiakki candy. It has that exact shape. Mmmm. That is so good. What we're about to show you is called dinner in the sky. And you're going to see some people sitting up on a table just hanging from a crane. Look for yourself. Market square is a great place to pick up fresh vegetables and berries, and you can also try a number of traditional Finnish dishes ranging from grilled salmon to reindeer meatballs. We frequented the market almost daily, and at 10 Euros a meal, we thought it was a budget-friendly option for travelers. So it is now time for lunch and we've stopped off at Market Square - one of my favorite places to grab a really tasty and cheap meal. Today we are having grilled salmon, potatoes and vegetables. And yeah, let's go enjoy this before it gets too cold. Alright, hungry boy. Ready for the first bite? It is time for some salmon. I never get tired of eating salmon. If I lived here I'd probably be eating this daily. So now that we're finished eating we're going to show you the more crafty side of Market Square. This is a great place to pickup some traditional Finnish products and souvenirs to take back home. Helsinki has a thriving design district and I really enjoyed visiting various shops which showcased the best of Scandinavian design. My favourite was, of course, Marimekko which is renowned for its bold patterns and bright colours. Right now I'm in the Marimekko store, which is one of the most famous design stores in all of Finland. Finland has a unique tradition where people come and wash their carpets on floating docks by the sea. The carpets are then left to dry overnight without fear of anyone stealing them. After washing your carpets it is a great area where you can just go and grab a drink and relax. Up next we're visiting the Kamppi Chapel of silence. This chapel is located in one of the busiest areas of Helsinki and it is supposed to be a place where anyone can drop by and just enjoy a moment of silence. No services are held in this church but they do have clergy and social workers on hand if anyone needs to speak with them. Me. Traveller. So Sam, do you think one day you'll be able to grow an impressive beard like Santa's? Never. It looks like peachy fuzz. That I glued onto my face. Helsinki has a number of unique landmarks and attractions. One of them being this church carved out of a rock. And what is really cool about it is that this church has amazing acoustics so it is actually a very popular concert hall. The roof consists of a copper dome surrounded by a skylight, which allows natural light to stream into the building. During one of our afternoons in Helsinki, we hopped aboard the Helsinki Sightseeing cruise. The trip was an hour and a half in length, and we got to see the various islands that make up the city's archipelago. It was a beautiful sunny day with blue skies, and we saw a lot of sailboats out on the water. It is a beautiful day to be outdoors today and we are all geared up to go on a bike ride. We are going to be taking a tour of Helsinki. How is it going so far? I'm getting a workout here. You look really silly with your ball cap and a helmet on. Come on, I'm starting a new fashion trend over here. This is what is considered cool these days. Oh, really? No, definitely not. But what is cool is that just getting outside of Helsinki, a few kilometers, and you're out right in the woods. This is amazing. Let's do a 360. So we just finished our four hour long bike ride around Helsinki and next up we are going kayaking. Right now it is nine PM and it is still bright out and I think we're supposed to be back at midnight. So let's go. Normally, I like to do a single kayak because I don't really trust Sam on the water but I've been talked into this double kayak for newlywed couples. Teamwork. Teamwork. Except, I'm the only one paddling because you're sitting back there filming. Yep, that's about right. Enjoy a few beers in the back of the double kayak. Yeah, I'll just have the beers, sit back and let her do all of the work. Right, Audrey? Oh, hush you. Paddle. Paddle faster. Argh. No, don't make it wobble. I'm going to tip it over. Wobble. Wobble. Wobble. Wobble. Sam, that is not. Sam. Okay, stop it. It is eleven thirty now and we are paddling back home in the dark. With nothing but the moon and our lights to guide us. This is a city that comes alive during the summer months, and it was great enjoying all the events taking place in the city as well as relaxing outdoors. We loved revisiting Helsinki and we discovered so many new places that we had completely skipped over the first time around. Have you been to Helsinki? Let us know about your experiences in the comments below. For more travel and food videos hit subscribe. So this is our first official little video here in Helsinki and we're just about to have a simple picnic lunch. We got some smoked salmon. Oooh la lah! That looks tasty. We go ourselves a nice baguette sandwich to enjoy in the park. A lovely pasta salad with feta cheese and some fizzy drinks to go along. So we're just going to enjoy the view and savor our dinner. Mmmmmm! The smoked salmon is easily my favorite part of this little picnic. It's a wonderful cheap meal. We were able to get all of this food for just roughly 10 Euro. So instead of going out for dining tonight we just decided to hit up a local grocery store, pick out some things that look good and it's turned into a fantastic little feast here on the park bench. Hello bird! Music playing More music playing Our first impression of Finland. One of the things we've noticed the most is just how cool the temperature is. I'm loving it. I can walk outside and I'm not sweating profusely. This city is definitely a lot quieter than where we come from. We've been living in Thailand for a few months and we're used to tuk-tuk's, motorbikes, honking, swirving and everything just.....yeah and meanwhile you can hear sirens and motorbikes in the background. This totally disproves my point...hahaha Music playing We've also noticed there is a really big biking and fitness culture here. Everyone seems to be riding around on their bikes, in-line skating and in this kind of weather who can blame them. Music playing So this is a bit of a cool supermarket we found right here. If you are too busy to go get your groceries all you need is your little smart phone. You can the bar codes for milk, for meatballs, ravioli, whatever, and they just deliver it to your place just like that. Wow! Music playing So we just across a bridge with love locks and that kind of reminded me of our love lock video that we made back in Korea. So it is eight forty five PM right now but as you can see it is still daylight out and that's because we are in the land of the midnight sun. So that's just a quick little intro into Helsinki we're both really tired so we're going to go get caught up some sleep and we'll make some more videos this week. Background music playing. Okay, we are with Raakel my Finnish Canadian friend who is showing us around and we're going to an Island called Suomenlinna. Does that mean anything? It's like Finland. It's kind of like a castle. Background music playing. So we've arrived here finally and we honestly have no idea what we're going to be doing. There is no tourist information. We're just going to wander around. Looks like a village. A cute village. I think this looks like Anne of Green Gable in Finland. The cute little wooden houses, right? Background music playing. We've just witnessed a lovely Finnish wedding on an island. Background music playing. And what are we doing? Enjoying some ice cream. Perfect way to cool down after a little walk around the island. What flavors do you have? Pistachio. And I have raspberry sherbet. And what is that in Finnish? Finnish answer. And I'm having the one unique to Finland. Black licorice ice cream and it is delicious. What is this called in Finnish? Speaking bad Finnish. Lemon and black licorice. Wow, this is really really good. I don't believe it. Background music playing. So this is day two in Helsinki. It is chilly as ever and we are going to do some sightseeing maybe visit a few churches and markets. And if we can we want to have reindeer meat at some point in the day. Oh, you are eating Santa's Helper! I'm going to be taking a bite out of Rudolph. We found a little dog park. Let's see how friendly these pups are. Ruff. Bark. Bark. Let's go. Background music playing. And here we are introducing Uspenski Cathedral. This is one of the best known churches in Helsinki and it is an Eastern Orthodox church. Background music playing. This particular vantage point on the walk is one of the most popular areas in the city for people to have picnics. While we were walking here yesterday we saw about four or five different groups over here just having their own little picnic and just watching the city as things go by. Background music playing. Hello. What am I? I didn't see her body. Music playing by street musicians. Background music playing. We are here in Harbor Market. It seems to be one of the bigger markets in Helsinki and what we've found to eat. We've found reindeer meatballs. So we're going to go try those right now. Reindeer meatballs here we go. Hi, could we please try the reindeer meatballs? Yes, sure. Those are big meatballs. I think those are potatoes. Would you like some vegetables as well? Oh, sure, yeah. How about garlic sauce? Um, sure, yeah, please. Background music playing. Oh no, I'm not ready but geez I don't have much of a choice. I'm filming. That seems like a big enough chunk, right? It is! And what are you having? Reindeer meatballs. First bite. Is it good? It tastes like a regular meatball. Okay. Yeah, it doesn't have a very strong reindeer flavor. It's more garlic-y from all of the sauce we put over top. And these have to be the biggest meatballs I have ever seen in my whole life. Okay. Let's see what you think of it. Yeah, they don't have as distinct of a flavor as I thought they may. But what I really like here is this garlic sauce that has been put over top. Background music playing. We're back here at the market. This time we've got a salmon dish. Same price. About 10 Euros. This is smothered in garlic sauce. I already know I'm going to like it. Oh, wow. that just melts in your mouth. Surprise, surprise, surprise! We are back in Finland almost one year to the day that we left. This is awesome. This is one of my favorite countries in all of Europe. Most people when they arrive sometimes they go and freshen up. They might splash a little water on their faces or maybe go to the washroom after a long nine hour flight. But no. What is the first thing that I do - get my Salmiakki candy. I've been craving this for over a year and I've already ate half of the bag and I'm having even more now. So good! What we're about to show you is called dinner in the sky. You are going to see some people sitting up on a table, just hanging from a crane. Look for yourself! The port area or market square appears to be even bigger and busier than last time year. It is just bustling with activity and there is a Ferris Wheel right over there. A bit hot and tired are we? Oh my gosh, so sweaty and tired. I need a shower and a bed. And you know what - this is easily the hottest day we've ever experienced in Finland. Yes. It is over thirty. We're back in jail. We stayed here last year. We did. Let's check out the room. Come on in. This room here used to be a jail cell which explains why the windows are so high up, so the prisoners couldn't escape. Also, they have really thick curtains here in Finland and that is because during the summer the sun just stays up a really long time. You wouldn't be able to sleep otherwise. We're back in Finland on an eight day adventure and we plan on shooting a daily vlog. Basically what we want to do is just show you exactly what we're doing and what it is like to be in Finland in the summer - both in the city and outside in the countryside doing more adventure types of activities. We just arrived at Lonna Island. This used to be a former military island and it has just opened to the public this summer, so we're going to check it out. It was a really cool meal. We had grilled fish and potatoes. And that is just like the quintessential Finnish summer meal. Background music playing. When we were looking for unique places to stay in Helsinki we ended up stumbling upon and article about a prison hotel in the city, so that is where we are today. We're going to give you a tour of the place. Background music playing. So we are staying in jail cell number 319. Background music playing. So this is the oldest hotel building in Finland. It was used as a prison right up until 2002. In 2007, it was converted into a hotel. So we're having breakfast right now in the basement. It has a bit of a dungeony feel and I love that we get tin cups. It really adds to the whole prison feel. It almost feels like I'm a prisoner here but with really good food. Background music playing. So my favorite part about breakfast are these pastries. They are called Karelian pies. Apparently they are filled with potatoes. They're supposed to look like brains. Taste like brains? Oh, yeah. And my favorite part of breakfast here is just this awesome combination of trail mix, fresh berries and thick yogurt. Wow! This is where the prisoners exercised and they would have just walked around the perimeter of the prison. Apparently, the male prisoners dug a tunnel from the men's common room to the women's jail cell. They did this not to escape but for social hour. So this little mushroom would have been where the security guard sat when the prisoners were out walking and he had to make sure that no one escaped. He also had a German Shepard to help him but this was his little shelter. Even in the winter when it was snowy. Sounds like torture doesn't it? Background music playing. So the hotel has a little outdoor cafe. A nice little terrace. It's called the Jailbird and here you can just sample some beers, enjoy some reindeer meat and other Finnish delicacies. And there is also live music almost every night. They do yeah. And who better than to go to jail than Audrey Bergner who is known for being a naughty girl. What??? It's our first full day in Finland and it is finally breakfast time. We actually woke up at two thirty in the morning because we were jet lagged and then the sun slowly started coming up at like four thirty in the morning. We've been waiting for this for a long time. Someone is hungry. Yes. That was a really filling breakfast. I think we're both just stuffed. We're going to go on a very small walk around jail hotel and show you the sites. They have a really cool little garden where it appears they're growing their own vegetables. It is a beautiful day to be outdoors today and we are all geared up to go on a bike ride. We are going to be taking a tour of Helsinki. How is it going so far? Oh, I'm getting a workout here. You look really silly with your ball cap and helmet on top. Come on, I'm starting a new fashion trend over here. This is what is considered cool these days. Oh really? No, definitely not. But what is cool is that just getting outside of Helsinki, a few kilometers, you're out right in the woods. This is amazing. Let's do a 360. We just finished our four hour long bike ride around Helsinki and next up we're going kayaking. Right now it is nine PM. It is still bright out and I think we're supposed to be back at midnight, so let's go. Normally I like to do a single kayak because I don't really trust Sam on the water but I've been talked into this double kayak for newlywed couples. Teamwork. Except, I'm the only one paddling because you're sitting back there filming. Yep, that's about right. Enjoy a few beers in the back of the double kayak. Yep, I'll just have the beers, sit back and let her do all of the work. Right, Audrey? Oh, hush. Paddle. Paddle faster. Argh. No, don't make it wobble. I'm going to tip it over. Wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble. Sam! That is not. Okay, stop it. It is eleven thirty now and we are paddling back home in the dark with nothing but the moon and our lights to guide us. Live rock music. So we are trying three different Finnish beers. We have lager, red ale and I have forgotten the name of this one. Verdict? That's nice. A nice light beer. Okay, next red ale. I like the flavor of this one a little more. What does it taste like? It's just got more of a bite to it. This is a lighter beer for sure. And the last one? My favorite. Really? It's all about the flavor. Alright, your turn. I'm going to start off with the light one. Lager. It tastes like a light beer. I don't know much about beer. Red ale. It has a nice aroma to it and it is a bit stronger than the other one. I agree. This I'm not so sure I will like it just based on the color. It looks really strong. Okay, what is your favorite of the three? I'm going to go with the light girly beer. Surprise, surprise. Rock music playing live. Background music playing. We're going to be eating Rudolph the Reindeer today! I'm a little sad about it but I'm in Finland so I have to try reindeer. Reindeer? Is it tasty or what? It really is. It has a very rich taste. It's must different from the meatballs we had before the other day. This definitely has a real much stronger taste to it. Wow. if I had to compare it to something that tastes like a really strong seasoned roast beef. I'm going to think of it as salami. Okay, it tastes like salami. There we go. I'm eating Reindeer. It's a little sour. Right? Yeah. It's a little sour and salty. Okay. Do you like it? Yeah. It's growing on you? Well, not growing on me but it's okay. Live rock music playing. So Sam has been talking about the reindeer ever since we landed in Finland, so I'm glad he finally got to try it. It was a bit of a pricey appetizer I have to admit. It was sixteen Euro. A bit steep but it was a good experience. I'd say it was worth it. The reindeer cold cuts definitely had a distinct taste. Quite sour and it was certainly a lot better than meatballs we had tried the other day.",False,20140817 - Helsinki Travel Guide & Finnish Cuisine in Finland.en.srt

A whirlwind tour of the Big Apple left us wanting to linger; however, the lure of the Chicago had us hopping on an Amtrak train again for our longest train journey of our three week trip. With comfortable seats and plenty of legroom, we devoted many of the long hours we had to kill to reading books and catching up on work on our computers. The highlight of the journey for us both was the fancy dining cart. Although our meal wasn't cheap, it was quite the experience sitting in a nice dining cart and being served a three course meal. We don't often splurge but when we do we thoroughly enjoy it. The nice weather of New York City faded by the time we got closer to Chicago. It started to rain quite heavily; however, the scenery was still fascinating and we ended up napping the rest of the way. These two trips with Amtrak certainly helped improve our opinion of overland travel in the United States. If we do another American road trip we'll definitely take the train again.",False,20140816 - Train Ride from New York City to Chicago with Amtrak.en.srt

We're here at the train station in Bangkok. We just finished a conference that lasted about four days and now we're heading back to home which is Chiang Mai. Background music playing. Hello. Six. Background music playing. And we are going to play a game of word association. Bangkok. The Hangover. Chiang Mai. Home. Toronto. China. I say China. Wait a second. China because whenever I say Toronto the way Torontonians say it people here 'China.' Bangkok. Crazy. Pad Thai. Mmmmmm. Delicious. Hockey. Blackhawks. Yeah! Football. Boring. Football. Boring. Heah! What team are you supposed to cheer for? Um, Canada. No, Argentina. Okay, good. Silly. Goose. Bunny. Honey bunny. Psy. Oppa Gangnam Style. Hey, you sexy lady. That's not a word. Stanley Cup. Chicago Blackhawks. They're going to win it. Background music playing. Someone got their nails done. I got a French manicure. My first one ever in my whole life and Sam is quite fascinated by it, as am I. Background music playing. Background music playing. Looking happy on the train. We're on a train to Bangkok! So right now we're in the dining carriage and as you can see there is no AC so the windows are open and the fans are blowing but I am still sweating profusely. Background music playing. Karaoke music playing in the background. What is wrong with this. Background music playing. A heart. Are you dreaming about cats or hamsters? cats? Nod, if it is cats. Yes, I'm dreaming about cats. Background music playing. So the first travel agent we went to in Chiang Mai told us there were no seats left on the train but look at this. We're on a train and no one is up there. And we are going to Bangkok on the train that is very full. NOT! So basically what happened is we went to this really shady travel agent for the first time and what they wanted to do was sell us a bus ticket. A really really overpriced bus ticket. Normally a bus ticket is only 400 Baht from Chiang Mai to Bangkok but they were trying to sell it to us for 750 Baht. They said no trains and only five seats left on the bus. Yeah, right. This will be my first time going to Bangkok. Last time I was there I was just in transit so I haven't seen any of the city and that is it for now. The end. Today we're going to be having a special experience. We are taking a bamboo train along these old tracks that used to run from Phnom Penh all the way to Battambang. This train is really just a bamboo platform with a few mats laid over top. It has a six horsepower engine and we're going to be speeding through and see what we find. We're on the bamboo train in Battambang! Having fun? Yes. It's going really really fast. Oh yeah! Well, our time in Saigon is over and we're now taking a train to Nha Trang for some beach time. Yes. And that is going to make one of us very happy. Who would that be? Oh yeah, I just love the beaches. You'll get lots more freckles. I do. I need more. I don't have enough. We have been eating local foods the whole time we have been here. Check that out. That is so Vietnamese. What is that? I think they may call that pizza. Iced cafe? I've got my favorite treat here - Vietnamese iced coffee. I paid 15,000 Dong for that which is about seventy five cents. Is it ever good. It is made with condensed milk and it has copious amounts of sugar. Take a big sip. Better than an Iced Cap from Tim Hortons back home. Okay, aside from the ice cap I think we need to discuss Sam's new look over here. A pretty obvious change. What is that? What do you mean what is that? That's my mustache. It is awesome. You love it. I'm a throwback from the seventies. There are two different classes in this train. We are traveling in the soft seat section which has AC and really cushiony chairs. Then you also have hard benches with fans. Yeah, what a big difference. I'm glad we got the ones here. It is a lot more comfortable. Chicken. We be having chicken for breakfast. One of my favorite snacks of all - fried spring rolls and I get to eat them on a train. Well, it's hard to believe but our time in Hong Kong has already expired. Today we're taking a train ride. Where are we going? We're crossing over into China. Hong Kong, of course, is a part of China but this is a Special Administrative Region, so we're actually going through immigration to get into Mainland China today. This is the first time we've taken a train where we've had to go through immigration to cross somewhere, so this should be interesting. Background music playing. We are in Guangzho. Apparently there are two train stations. We arrived at the one that is on the East End of the City and we had to get across town to the other and it was difficult but we need to keep going. Background music playing. So right now we are in Guangzho station waiting for our train to Guilin. And we happen to be waiting in the VIP room. Background music playing. There is no tea in this tea room. We're going to Guilin. Uh, we're looking for number ten. Background music playing. So we're in the dining cart now getting ready to have dinner. Let's see what is on the menu if we can even read it. We barely got a seat here. Background music playing. Decision time. So we did manage to find an English menu which makes things a lot easier. Background music playing. Fish one. Tofu with pork. One. Okay. Rice. One Rice? Okay. Beer. One. Okay. Ah, green tea - one. okay. background music playing. So this is the friend fish with a sweet and sour sauce. It's got some pineapple on top And then we have the pork with tofu over here which looks really tasty and some rice to go along with it. And of course a beer. Sam had to get his beer. Taking the skin off. Trying to get at the meat. There it is. Mmmmm. It's nice and salty. Well, how are you enjoying that tofu? It's not bad. It's really spicy. Background music playing. Good morning. We are almost in Guilin. Our train has been delayed about an hour and a half. So we're just hanging out in the dining cart. Breakfast isn't being served for some reason so we're just enjoying what is left over of our snacks from yesterday, so a few salty peanuts. These little hazelnut cakes. Water chestnut cakes? Yeah. And that's about it. Background music playing. We are at KL Sentral and it is really early in the morning and today we are boarding a train that is going to take us all the way up to Butterworth and from there we are taking a ferry over to Penang. I am super excited today because this my first time taking the trains in Malaysia. Train transportation is by far my favorite way of getting around in any country. It appears our journey today is going to be about seven hours, so we've got a nice long train trip ahead of us. We're on the train now and as you can see we've almost got the whole place to ourselves. We've been on the train for an hour and a half now and we've already devoured all of the snacks we brought along except for the peanuts, so we've decided to purchase a little rice-y goodness over here. Hungry boy, what are we having? Well, we have fried rice. Your favorite. We are on a very exciting train journey. We have been traveling for a few hours now and we are just crossing through the jungle. I want to live in a jungle. You seem like a jungle kind of girl. Yes, in a shack in the jungle. With me? Maybe? Whatever. We're finally getting close to Butterworth here. We've been on a journey that has actually been over seven hours. The train is slightly delayed and it looks like we're about 20 kilometers outside of Butterworth. From there we are going to grab a quick bite to eat and then we're off on a twenty minute ferry to get to Penang our final destination. It has been a very long journey and how am I going to reward myself by eating Indian food. Oh yeah. The first thing we're doing in Butterworth according to you. We are. I want Indian food. Butter me up here in Butterworth. Right over here is the Eastern Oriental Express train - one of the luxury trains that goes all of the way from Singapore to Bangkok. It is a train we both really want to take someday. We are almost at our destination. We are taking the ferry from Butterworth to Penang. We're pulling in to the port now and this is the end of journey. It has been a full day event. We woke up at four AM this morning to work on blogging projects. We left the guesthouse by seven. We hopped on the train by eight forty and it is now almost five thirty. We are completely knackered. We are starving. We are going to get a big plate of food. I don't care what it is. Indian food! Whatever? I don't care. We're going to eat. We're going to feast and we're going to drop off our bags wherever we're staying and we're going to chillax the rest of the day.",False,"20140816 - Epic Train Travel In Asia∩╝Ü China, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia train journeys.en.srt"

We decided to set ourselves a challenge to see and do as much as we possibly could, and that gave way to this video guide which highlights 50 of the top attractions. In a city like New York this means we barely scratched the surface, but hopefully this video will highlight the cornucopia of possibilities that is the Big Apple. Most journeys begin at Penn Station or Grand Central Terminal, and if you arrive at the later you'll be wowed by the building. We're now visiting The High Line, which is an old section of rail tracks that used to run from Chelsea all the way to the Meatpacking district. This area has actually been reclaimed and turned into a park which is pretty cool. The Meatpacking District was once home to markets, slaughterhouses, and packaging plants, but times have changed. Today you'll find a mixture of trendy restaurants, clubs and boutiques. The Village used to be a bohemian neighborhood that drew artists and musicians, but today you're more likely to find upper middle class families living here. The streets are shaded and quiet, and it's a nice place for a casual stroll. Before coming to New York City there were a few things I absolutely wanted to do and one of them was to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and I'm doing that right now. Completed in 1883, Brooklyn Bridge is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the United States. It connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Today we are over in Williamsburg which is one of the more popular neighborhoods here in Brooklyn. It definitely has a very young feel. I'm seeing a lot of twenty something year old's and that means lots of flea markets, independent restaurants and art galleries. Williamsburg has become quite popular given its lower rent prices. University students and young professionals have been flocking to this part of town. We got to see a lot of cool street art around Williamsburg, including murals along Bedford, Fillmore, and Roebling. This is a massive park located in Brooklyn and it was designed by the same landscape architects who brought Central Park to life. We are now visiting the historic district of DUMBO and that stands for down under the Manhattan bridge overpass. You can walk along the riverfront for a great view of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges and the Manhattan skyline. You can't come to New York and not have a slice of pizza. I can't think of a better place to have it here than in Brooklyn. We were kind of tired from a long day of walking and we decided to take a little break at Bryant Park. Low and behold we found that they have free board games that anyone can use throughout the day. You'll catch friends, couples, and families playing games like chess, dominoes and scrabble. During the summer months, Bryant Park also becomes a popular hangout spot for people looking to relax and even work on their tans. After visiting Bryant Park, you'll want to pop into the library for a look at the beautiful interior. The Staten Island Ferry is free of charge and this makes it really popular with visitors who want to catch a glimpse of the Statue of Liberty from a distance. If you want to get a closer look at Lady Liberty, you'll have to buy tickets to Liberty Island. If you make reservations well in advance, you can even climb to the viewing platform inside the crown. Battery Park is located on the southern tip of Manhattan. It is home to a few different memorials and you'll also catch a lot of visitors hanging out in this area as they wait to catch a ferry. Little Italy may be slowly shrinking, but it's still a great place to grab some Italian food & a gelato for dessert. Having both lived in South Korea, we were thrilled to come across Manhattan's own Little Korea. We seized the opportunity and found a restaurant serving kimchi, pajeon, and kimchi bokkeum bap. If you're looking for a bargain, Chinatown is a fun place to visit. The storefronts usually spill onto the sidewalks. It's one of the few places where you can haggle on the price of things. Coney Island is all about good old fashioned fun. You can ride roller coasters, stroll down the boardwalk, enjoy some beach time, and then head over the Nathan's Famous hot dogs. We happened to be here during a parade, which explains why the streets were so busy. And that's our next tip - if you're here in June, don't miss the Mermaid Parade! We are now in the northwest end of Manhattan visiting The Cloisters and this building was built in the Medieval architectural style and it is home to some really lovely sculptures and paintings so we're going to be visiting those. The Cloisters will make you feel like you've traveled over to Europe. This place a peaceful retreat from Manhattan's busy streets. The Apollo is one of the most famous music halls in New York City. Amateur Night is on Wednesdays, and it's great for spotting upcoming talent. We're in Harlem for some soul food and we've heard some great things about Sylvia's. We can't wait to go and have some fried chicken. We ended up having smothered chicken, and it melted in our mouths. Delicious! While in the city we also dropped by the National September 11 Memorial. We then made our way to Trinity Church which holds one of the oldest burial grounds in Manhattan and is the final resting place of many historic figures. We're here now at Wall Street where millions are made and lost. We're now visiting the Lincoln Center, which is a space that celebrates the performing arts. It is home to the opera, the ballet and the theater. Art aficionados will love the possibilities the Lincoln Center offers. While I wouldn't recommend biking Manhattan's congested streets, Central Park really is a great place for a bike ride. If you're looking to cover a lot of ground, you can pick up a bike from one of the many rental shops. One thing you absolutely have to do when you come to New York is watch a New York Yankees baseball game. Right now we're at Yankee Stadium and this is the most historic baseball franchise. They've won more World Series than any other team. We have a very exciting day of museum hopping ahead of us. Our first stop is the MET or the Metropolitan Museum of Art and I'm really looking forward to browsing the different galleries. Admission to the Met is by suggested donation only, meaning you can give whatever you can afford. This triangular shaped skyscraper is one of the most iconic buildings in the city. If you approach the building from a certain angle it looks 2-dimensional. Washington Square Park is popular with families looking to cool down during the summer months. There is a large fountain where kids like to climb and splash around. The park is also known for its arch which is reminiscent of that in Paris. And while you visit Washington Square Park, you can also take the opportunity to swing by the NYU campus. The National Museum of the American Indian has a very interesting collection, and the best part is that admission is free of charge. The American Museum of Natural History is located in the Upper West Side, and it has an extensive dinosaur collection. We are now in Times Square - the busiest intersection in all of New York City. If you're going to be visiting I recommend you come at night time when all of the lights are on and it is just crowded. Times Square has often been nicknamed ""The Center of the Universe"" and ""The Crossroads of the World"". An estimated 330,000 people pass through daily. Modern art lovers can pop into the MoMa for a visit. A really fun way to get over to Roosevelt Island is to take a cable car from Manhattan. This tramway runs from Manhattan to Roosevelt Island and the ride lasts 3 minutes. It's a fun way to get an aerial overview of the city, but it's also slightly unnerving if you don't like heights! Ahh, Fifth Avenue is a shopping Mecca. The street is lined with prestigious high-end boutiques, and it's considered to be one of the most expensive shopping streets in the world. The Top of the Rock Observation Deck is located on the 70th floor and offers 360 degree unobstructed views. The Empire State Building was the world's tallest building for almost 40 years. While it has been surpassed many times since, it still boasts some of the best views of New York City. Carnegie Hall is a concert venue and it often plays host to classical performances. This morning we're exploring Central Park also known as the lungs of New York City. Now this park is massive and there are so many different entrances. It is almost like a bit of a maze. If you really want to see the park properly you've got to come several times and you've got to enter from different vantage points. Central Park is massive and there are so many places to visit within its boundaries. We managed to visit Belvedere Castle, the Great Lawn, Shakespeare Garden, The Ramble, The Jackie Onassis Reservoir, the Alice in Wonderland Statue, and we still left feeling like we barely scratched the surface. Strawberry Fields is a section of Central Park dedicated to the memory of John Lennon. This was a place Lennon used to frequent, and travelers from far and wide stop by to leave a rose and pay their respects. We're just outside of the MET and I've got a giant pretzel in my hand. It is piping hot. It is delicious. I'm going to try a bite. It is really dough-y and wow is it ever salty. You can't come to New York without taking in a musical. There are so many different ones you can choose from Mama Mia to Phantom of the Opera. We are here now at Madison Square Garden which is home to the NHL's New York Rangers one of the most historic hockey teams. This building is one of the most famous in the whole world for entertainment. You can watch concerts, you can watch shows. This is where lots of live performances happen. This is a memorial site to the unnamed free and enslaved Africans who were buried here. It was only rediscovered in 1991. The cool thing about this intersection is that it's the point from which all official distances from New York City are measured. One of the best ways to get around New York City is of course by Metro. I've got this MetroCard over here and I paid thirty dollars and this has allowed me to go around the city for seven full days with unlimited use. If you want to really explore New York City, we recommend picking up a MetroCard so that you can zip around the city with no restrictions. It's cheap and it's efficient. And that concludes a look at our very busy week in New York City. I'm still shocked we managed to cover so many attractions, but the great thing about this city is that distances aren't very long and there's always something really cool worth checking out around each corner. Have you been to New York? What are your favorite things about this city? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section below. As a die hard fan of the Chicago Blackhawks and Chicago Cubs, sports is what first brought me to the Windy City. However, over the years I've come to appreciate the phenomenal architecture, food scene, entertainment and cultural options the city has to offer. I was excited to be taking Audrey here for the first time. The following is a guide to the city's top attractions. Sit back and enjoy the top 35 things to do in Chicago! A really great way to enjoy the architecture here in Chicago is to take a river walk. Chicago River is lined with truly impressive buildings on either side and you can just walk along and enjoy them. We got to see buildings like Marina City, Trump Tower, and Wrigley Building. This was by far one of our favorite things to do in the city. Alternatively, if you're not up for a walk, architecture river tours are a fun way to take in the sights along the river. If you find yourself here during the summer months kayaking is a popular activity. Now we are here at The Bean which is also known as Cloud Gate. This is a really cool sculpture by Init Kapur and as you can see people are having lots of fun taking photos. The Crown Fountain is a cool interactive sculpture located in Millennium Park. It's a nice escape from the heat and you'll find lots of kids splashing around in the water. Summer is a great time to be in Chicago because of all the free events that take place in the pavilion. We managed to catch a free movie and some concerts during our stay. Art lovers will enjoy the Art Institute of Chicago, which holds the work of great artists like Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Gaugin. Taking in a Chicago Cubs baseball game at Wrigley field is a must for anyone who visits the city. The Cubs are called the lovable losers and last won a World Series when the Ottoman Empire was still in power but that doesn't stop the die hard fans from rooting for them. You can't come to Chicago and not eat deep-dish pizza! During our week here we ate at many pizzerias in town including Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, Gino's East Side, and Pizzeria Uno. Delicious! Formerly known as the Sears Tower, Willis Tower is now the 2nd tallest building in the United States. It happened to be a very foggy day when we visited so we got some cool photos. We're at the University of Chicago. It has a beautiful campus and there are several noteworthy buildings. We're going to give you a bit of a tour right now. Many of the buildings at the University of Chicago were designed in the Gothic style; for a perfect example of this, step inside the beautiful Rockefeller Chapel. Then be sure to wander the rest of the campus where the buildings are covered in ivy. The campus is also home to the Oriental Institute where the public can view an extensive collection of artifacts from the Near East. Right now we are visiting the Osaka Garden here in Chicago. It is a very tranquil place with lots of little paths that you can walk down. It is just a really nice escape from the city. The Osaka Garden is located in Jackson Park which is in Chicago's South Side. This Chicago neighborhood was made famous by the movie Wicker Park starring Josh Hartnett and Diane Kruger. If you visit the neighborhood today you'll find it has a very hipster feel, with lots of street art down every alley. Humboldt Park is a little far removed from the downtown area so it's not as popular with visitors, however, it's a really great place to soak in nature. You can wander around the pond, catch a pick up game of baseball, or grab a bite from one of the many food trucks parked in the area. For a chance to come face to face with dinosaurs, head over to the Field Museum. This museum is home to the largest and most complete T-Rex to have ever been found and her name is Sue. Right next door is the Shedd Aquarium which is a popular attraction for families. We're here now at the United Center, home of the Chicago Blackhawks. Now this is my favorite NHL hockey team. Being here is extremely exciting for me. I'm hanging out here with Jonathan Toews, the current captain. This team has been immensely successful lately. They've won two Stanley Cups recently in 2010 and 2013 and I think they may have a dynasty on hand. Now someday I'd love to see a Toews and Kane statue here. While in the city, we also got to visit a cool art installation called ""Borders"". It's located in the Solti Gardens at Grant Park and we had fun trying to blend in with the sculptures. We're here now at Buckingham Fountain and I know I'm dating myself a bit here by saying this but for fans of Married with Children this is the fountain that was used in the opening credits. Having already gone up the Willis Tower by day, we decided to visit the John Hancock Center by night. The city really dazzles from the 94th floor. The Navy Pier is a fun place to visit on a weekend. The pier is lined with fun rides including a giant Ferris Wheel, a wave swing, and a carousel. There are a number of free attractions in Chicago. One of them being the Lincoln Park Zoo. Now we're going to check it out and I'm hoping to spot a polar bear. While visiting we spotted lots of animals including lions, tigers, and rhinos. Afterwards we headed over to conservatory. Located in the north end of the city, North Avenue Beach is a popular hangout spot with beach-goers. You'll find people jogging, playing sports, and working on their tans. For improvise comedy there's no better place than The Second City. This theater troupe has seen some pretty big names pass through. We're in for a bit of a strange evening today. We're going to be playing a game called Trapped in a Room with a Zombie. Basically we're going to get locked in a room for sixty minutes with a Zombie and a whole bunch of other participants. We have one hour to try and figure out clues to escape the room before the Zombie is set loose. The zombie is going to be chained to the wall and every five minutes releases another foot. We need to try and solve this game quickly otherwise the Zombie is going to be loose and trying to grab us. Let's see how it goes. It is going to eat you first. You look tasty. We were eaten alive by the zombie after all. The Magnificent Mile is a shopper's paradise. This area is home to high end boutiques and department stores. The Chicago L, or the elevated line, is great for getting around town. A week pass is $28 for unlimited travel. We're here now at Soldier Field, home of the Chicago Bears. They play football in the National Football League and I just got myself a new hat. This afternoon we are visiting the Money Museum at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. This is a museum that very few people know about because it is actually empty right now but it is completely free to visit. We're going to show you some money. The Divvy is Chicago's bike sharing system. It is ideal for quick trips and you can drop the bikes off at any station around town. Chicago's Museum of Science and Technology is the largest science museum in the Western Hemisphere. They cover everything from submarines to weather patterns. This home may not look that impressive from the exterior, but it's an important example of the Prairie School architectural style which is uniquely American. If you tire of walking, segway tours are another fun way to zip around the city. It's hard to miss the flashing lights of the historic Chicago Theatre! Their events calendar is packed with some big names from the music industry. And that's a little preview at our week long visit to Chicago! We tried to cover some of the well-known attractions as well as some sights that lie a little further from the downtown. We hope this video will help you plan your next visit to Chicago. If you've already been to the Windy City, be sure to leave us a comment and let us know about some of your favorite spots.

This is a city where I was born, so it is always really fun to come and revisit. We are going to be showing you some of the main attractions around town. For our summer getaway we decided to visit Montreal. Located in the province of Quebec, this city offers world class festivals, arts, entertainment and dining. We wanted to highlight what makes this city so special, so here are 30 things to do in Montreal. Our first stop was the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts for a look at some of the current exhibitions. One of the nice things about this museums is that admission to the permanent collection is free at all times. Well, it is time to burn off all of that Poutine. We're here at Park Mount Royal and we're going to walk around and explore to see what is going on. This is one of the biggest parks in the city. We just spotted a woodpecker up in the tree. This is where locals come to escape the bustle of the city. You'll find many people picnic-ing here on a weekend. We've been walking around Mount Royal for a while now and we've finally reached one of the many lookout points of the city and there are some amazing views. On a clear day you can see the whole city. During our visit to Montreal we chose to stay in the neighborhood of Le Plateau-Mont Royal. The area is quite lively with lots of bars and restaurants, and the residential streets are lined with spiral staircases. There were also lots of friendly cats who came out to greet us in the morning. Summers in Montreal are a lot of fun. On Sunday afternoons you'll find a huge drumming circle on the east end of Mount Royal. We're now here at McGill University, one of Canada's oldest and most prestigious universities. It is a gorgeous day outside so we're just going to wander around campus and show you around. McGill University is one of the most prestigious universities in all of Canada. Even if you're not a student, the campus is worth a little stroll. There is one dish that you absolutely have to try when you come to Montreal and that is poutine. This is a French Canadian dish and for those who aren't very familiar with it. It is basically french fries with gravy and cheese curds on top. Now it sounds a little bit gross and it doesn't look that appetizing at first sight but trust me it is delicious. It is time for the big reveal. Look down here. This is the standard one. Look at all of the cheese curd. It is melting. And the gravy. These fries are swimming in a pool of gravy. That is amazing. Time for the first bite of the classic poutine here. Let's get lots of gravy on it. Woah, stringy cheese. Oh, I got it on my mouth. Wow! That is so good. I just wish this was healthy so that I could eat it more often. For a taste of French charm, wander down the cobbled streets of Old Montreal. It'll feel like you've traveled back to France several centuries. There are lots of great restaurants to try in this area. For fine dining and shopping in trendy boutiques, you can pop into the Bonsecours Market. Habitat 67 is a unique housing complex and one of the most interesting architectural landmarks in the city. Whether you visit Montreal in the summer or winter, there are always festivals going on. Be sure to check them out! Tonight we're at the Cirque du Soleil here in Montreal and we're going to be watching their latest show Curious. While we can't bring you inside the tent, we can tell you that it is a fascinating performance that takes you into a different world. This roman catholic basilica is located on the Westmount Summit and you'll have to climb 283 steps to reach the top. The biodome is a popular attraction for families with children. It allows you to walk through replicas of four ecosystems found in the Americas. We're here now at Olympic Stadium. This used to be the former stadium of the Montreal Expos, a baseball team that has since moved to Washington. I was fortunate enough in the 90's to come and watch them play when they had such great players such as Larry Walker who is considered to be by many the best Canadian baseball player ever. Originally though this stadium was built for the Olympics in the 70's and this is still the largest stadium in Canada in terms of seating capacity. Because there was some landscaping work being done, we didn't get to walk the extent of the gardens, however, there is plenty to see here. The botanical gardens are home to Japanese Gardens, Chinese Gardens and even Alpine Gardens. Right now I'm here at the Bell Center, home to the Montreal Canadiens, one of the most historic and celebrated franchises in all of sports - not just in the NHL but all of sports. They have such a storied history but as a Blackhawks fan my team has been doing better lately so I've got bragging rights right now. You have to eat smoked meat if you come all the way to Montreal and there's not better place to do so that at Schwartz. This restaurant is an institution and it's worth lining up for. The Notre Dame Basilica is located in the historic district of Old Montreal. Step inside to be wowed by the blue ceilings and gold-adorned altar. If you enjoy checking out graffiti and street art I would highly recommend the area around Saint Catherine's in the East end of the city. It is just so colorful. You can wander down the lanes. So many artists have taken over the area, so check it out. Next up we're heading to St. Catherine street which is the place to go shopping. The street is lined with different stores and boutiques and I know Sam is going to love this. This is the main commercial artery of the city. Montreal has long, brutal winters and this is when the underground city plays an important role. Most of the downtown area is interconnected by underground paths and underground shopping areas so you don't have to be out in the cold. Parc Lafontaine is located in the borough of Le Plateau Mont-Royal and it's a popular hangout spot on weekends. Friends come to play sports and enjoy a picnic by the pond. Le Village is a vibrant neighbourhood which is home to many bars, clubs, and theatres. In the summertime the street is lined with 200,000 pink balls over the pedestrian only street. So now for a little afternoon pick me up we have St. Viateur bagels, which are really famous here in Montreal. I got myself the cinnamon raisin one. That smells really nice. What makes these bagels unique is that they are hand rolled and they are made in a wood burning oven. This store is so popular that they actually produce twelve thousand bagels a day. Alright, time for the first bite. I don't know if you can see it well with the camera but there are huge chunks of apples. Look at that. Wow! Are you in your happy place? I am. This is like ultimate dessert for me. A great way to get around the city is by bike. Bixi stations let you hire out bikes for a few hours or for the full day, and you can return them at any bike station in the city. This is another popular cathedral in the city. It is the third largest church in the province of Quebec. Montreal's Old Port is worth a wander. You can enjoy a quiet stroll along the waterfront or stop for a mid-afternoon nap and one of the many little parks found in the area. The best way to get around Montreal is by hopping on the metro. If you're going to be in the city for a few days we suggest you get a pass so that you can zip around from one neighborhood to the next. This Canal is popular with cyclists. It runs 14.5 kilometers starting from the Old Port of Montreal. So there you have it - a quick little glimpse at this beautiful French city. From festivals to live entertainment, and dining to shopping, Montreal has plenty to offer for travellers. Have you been to Montreal? Let us know what you love about this city in the comments below. If you want to experience a Canadian city with a bit of French flair, then you need to visit Quebec City. Situated on the banks of the St. Lawrence River, this is a town with good looks and a big heart. We only had a day and a half there, but that was enough time to wander the cobbled streets, catch some street performances, and visit many of the top attractions. The following is a little video of our time in historic Quebec City. We are no standing on the Plains of Abraham and this is the location where the battle between the English and the French was fought. This was the battle that ultimately determined the fate of North America. This battle was part of the Seven Years' War and it would be the deciding factor over the fate of New France, influencing the later creation of Canada. We just finished visiting the Citadelle and if you get the chance I would suggest you try to be here by ten in the morning. That is when they have the changing of the guard ceremony and it is a lot of fun to watch. They even have a pet goat that takes part so it really is a lot of fun. The Citadelle is the largest British fortress in North America. Now we're visiting Chateau Frontenac, one of the most famous hotels in all of Canada. It is a stunner. It is just absolutely beautiful. We're trying to capture it from different vantage points. The hotel was designed by American architect Bruce Price. It was one of many ""chÃ¢teau"" style hotels built for the Canadian Pacific Railway company with the goal of promoting luxury tourism. Today, a night at the Frontenac starts at $379 dollars. This boardwalk that we are currently standing on is called Terrasse Dufferin and it is a great place for a stroll. You can catch some street performers, eat some ice cream and you also get some great views of the river below. The promenade sits right outside the Chateau Frontenac and it is 425 meters in length. You can also catch a funicular nearby which takes you to the Old Lower Town. Petit Champlain is a neighbourhood located in the Old Lower Town. It is quite picturesque, especially when viewed from the Breakneck Stairs. The narrow cobbled streets are lined with small shops and cafes. It's a really fun neighborhood to explore with a camera in hand. It is a human car wash. The Basilica Notre Dame de Quebec is the oldest church in the Americas north of Mexico. If you want to get a sneak peek at the crypt, you'll have to sign up for a guided tour. We're now walking along Rue St. Paul and this is a great place to browse for antiques and you can buy some souvenirs. Just don't leave your visit to the end of the day because you may find that a lot of the shops have closed. The Museum of Civilization is a great place to learn about the Aboriginal peoples of Quebec. We're here now in the Port Area. This is a great place to take a ferry. A lot of people come here to exercise, to fish and just to enjoy the views of the St. Lawrence river. It is a really relaxing place. The Port of Quebec is the oldest in all of Canada and it played an important role in developing the region. Today you'll find that cruises have replaced much of the former freight traffic. And lastly, you can't come to Quebec City and not catch a street performance! The city celebrates its performers and you'll often find acts taking place in the town square and parks. Grab a seat for some live entertainment and don't forget to leave a tip at the end! And that concludes our brief but very enjoyable trip to Quebec City!

Given that I've spent nearly the past decade traveling in some way, shape or form it is almost shocking that I've never spent any time in New York City. As I leaned back in my seat I felt adrenaline rushing through my veins as the excitement of finally visiting the Big Apple was suddenly becoming a reality. Amtrak trains are on par with Via Rail in terms of comfort; however, there is even more leg room and overhead storage space. In fact, I've never been able to stretch out my legs on a train without touching the next seat. The only thing that was mildly inconvenient was that the wifi was sporadic throughout the journey. I suppose having the time to video edit and read my kindle, as opposed to mindlessly surfing online, was a more productive use of my time when I wasn't marveling at the scenery outside. What impressed me about this trip was just how scenic Upstate New York really is. I didn't have many preconceived expectations; however, I must admit that I didn't expect to spend most of our journey passing through lakes, forests and quaint little towns. As we approached New York city we started spotting mansions that looked as though they were castles! Being treated to a sunset was the ultimate way for us to end what was a very comfortable journey. If you are deciding between bus or train, I would definitely go with Amtrak.",False,20140804 - Train Ride from Montreal to New York City with Amtrak.en.srt

This is a French Canadian dish and for those who aren't very familiar with it, it is basically french fries with gravy and cheese curds on top. Now it sounds a little bit gross and it doesn't look that appetizing at first sight but trust me it is delicious. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this meal from a nutritional standpoint. It is pure grease and no better way for us to sample it than in this park right here. We went to one of the most famous restaurants in Montreal for Poutine - La Banquise - and in this bag here I've got two different kinds. One is the regular poutine and one is the premium kind. We're going to show you what is inside. It is time for the big reveal. Look down here. This is the standard one. Oh, look at all of the cheese curd. It is melting. And the gravy. It is like these fries are swimming in a pool of gravy. That is amazing. You've got a premium kind. What did you get? I went for something a little bit fancier and mine has bacon and goat cheese instead of the regular cheese curds. Alright, let's open this. Oh, wow! Look at that goat cheese. This is going to be amazing. This is the kind of meal we're going to have to walk off for hours and hours and hours upon end. Look at that cheese. My goodness. First bite of the fancy poutine. That is just as good as imagined it would be. The goat cheese is warm, it is gooey, it is soft and the bacon is amazing. It is greasy, salty. It is amazing! How about the gravy? Mmmmm. Time for the first bite of the classic poutine here. Let's get lots of gravy on it. Woah, stringy cheese! I got it all over my mouth. Wow! That is so good. I just wish this was healthy so I could eat it more often. It is like a heart attack on a plate. We've been having this every day since we've been to Montreal and I don't see us stopping until we leave. Out of the two poutines that we had, my favorite of course was the one with goat cheese and bacon because those ingredients are just stellar. Even if you don't like bacon there is a whole variety of toppings that you can choose over at La Banquise. There are mushrooms, green peppers, hot chilly and anything that you can think of. So how much does a poutine cost? The regular one was just under seven dollars and the premium one was about nine bucks, so it is quite an affordable meal. I'm really excited right now. Montreal smoked meat along with things such as Poutine, is something you absolutely have to try when you're in Montreal. I'm going to go sample a sandwich right now. Montreal smoked meat is made from brisket and the meat is allowed to cure for one week with peppercorn and lots of other spices. It is really flavorful by the end of that week. I'm going to take a bite over here. Let's see what this tastes like. Wow, look at all of that meat. Oh my, this is falling apart and it smells great. You can see the mustard as well. Look at that. Oh my, oh my gosh. Keep that sandwich together there. Okay, I'm going to need a huge napkin after this. Wow. Oh my gosh. That is so tasty. The meat is really juicy and tender. It is served on rye bread with mustard and I just love that combination. Really simple flavors, the meat is smokey and it is great. Look at that massive piece of meat. The thing is a bohemoth. I can barely keep it together in my hands. It is time for my first bite. It is so tender and delicious. That is one There is one establishment in Montreal that is really well known for its smoked meat. That is a little deli placed Schwartz's and it has been around since the 1920's. However, that is not the only place where you can get smoked meat. There is actually restaurants and little shops across town that serve almost the exact same recipe, so it is not difficult to track it down. In a place that specializes for Montreal smoked meat, such as Schwartz's, you can order it lean cut, medium or fatty. We've tried a few different ones and medium is our favorite so far. Some of the popular side orders that you can also get with your smoked meat sandwich include poutine, french fries or pickles. For a typical smoked meat sandwich in Montreal you are looking at roughly six to eight dollars and it is well worth the price to try. So now for a little afternoon pick me up we have St. Viateur bagels, which are really famous here in Montreal. I got myself the cinnamon raisin one. That smells really nice. What makes these bagels unique is that they are hand rolled and they are made in a wood burning oven. This store is so popular that they actually produce twelve thousand bagels a day.

We're going for a special organic meal at a restaurant that grows its own vegetables and herbs. Oh, wow! Can you hear the sound of the water. This is Sam on the Waterwheel. You're a natural. If this isn't fun I don't know what is. You should move out here and take up farming. So this place is amazing. It's like a little organic oasis where they just grow different herbs and vegetables. Everyone is farming and it is so peaceful and quiet and it is beautiful. Look at all of the flowers around this. We have a very special drink here. It is called the water wheel drink. It's made with lemon basil seed and ginger. Let's take a sip of that. It tastes very healthy. In a good way or a bad way? In a pretty good way. Okay. Tra Que is a small farming community village located two kilometers northeast of the Ancient Hoi An town area. We just came here for dinner but if you decide to visit this village you can also work with the farmers for the day, you can take a rice paper making class or you can take a cooking class. If you've been following along with our recent food videos you probably have noticed we've been having these pancakes a lot and they are delicious. I have to say that the presentation of these ones down here looks the best. So these here are the best country pancakes we've had. What I really like about them is that they are not as oily or greasy as the other ones. They have a little bit of a fluffier texture. So this lovely presented dish is called three friends and there are three friends right in my hand. We have shrimp, pork and vegetables wrapped around. Pop that in your mouth. Friendly? I've got some good pals in my mouth. These tres amigos are almost too pretty to eat. Thank you. Easy. So here we have our colorful papaya salad and I didn't realize it was going to be this big. I started to think we ordered way too much food. Are you kidding me? With me here? Too much food? I'll take care of that. Well to sum up this meal I can honestly say this is the best dinner I've had since I've been in Vietnam. I absolutely loved the dishes. You could just taste the freshness in every single dish we had. The prices were really affordable. The portions were generous and it was cooked really healthy. Nothing was greasy or too oily. It was just absolute delight to come here and eat. I definitely agree. I think the long bike ride out here was definitely worth it and it is nice eating in such a quiet and peaceful setting just being surrounded by the farm. So we highly recommend it if you're in Hoi An. Today we are eating lunch at the Bale Well in Hoi An. This is a very small local restaurant. They have a fixed menu. Actually there is no menu. They just bring you food and you pay a fixed price and you eat as much as you want. There focus is on country pancakes and spring rolls. Which we both love! You take the salad, cucumber, kimchi and a spring roll. It is going to be crunchy. Now that is a special roll. That has got meat. Thank you very much. So I dip it here? Give it a try Audrey. Here we go. How is that? Wow, hard to bite huh? So you are going to what? Well, Sam here wasn't paying attention to whole assembly process, so I will have to demonstrate how to roll a spring roll. Okay, so we add a little bit of greens including some lettuce. A bit of fumbling with the chopsticks there. Hey, don't be hating. Then she said this is our kimchi which looks a bit different from the kimchi we ate in Korea. This is Vietnamese style Kimchi. It must be pickled vegetables. Then she added a spring roll. Don't forget the meat. Let's try this one. Yeah, try a smaller one. I don't know if it is chicken or beef but it looks good and smells good. Now that is a super loaded roll. Ok, now to roll it tightly. Viola! This is it. Now you add just a little bit of chilly to the sauce. It is kind of a peanut based sauce I think. And we dip and enjoy! Oh, there comes more food. Oh wow, here is the country pancakes. Yum. So this delectable roll. This time instead of the spring roll it has the country pancake inside of it. So we're going to give it a try. Is that better? These rolls are amazing! You've got pancakes, springs rolls, the greens, the skewered satay all in this. Happy boy! And if that feast wasn't enough we've got a little sweet treat to end off with. What flavor did you get? I got cherry. And the dessert just keeps on coming. Now we have fresh pineapples. Do you have any room for that? No, but I'll eat it. Okay, seriously that was the feast of feasts. Normally country pancakes or spring rolls or satay taste great on their own but all wrapped up together in one big roll dipped into a peanut sauce. WOW! Our lunch came to one hundred and eighty thousand Dong which is about nine dollars. I think that is a great price because they just kept bringing out plates and plates of food and we were stuffed and then they were offering us dessert and it was like 'oh, I don't want to turn it down I guess I'll eat it anyway' so yeah it was a great selection there. The service there is really friendly almost in a very unique kind of way. There was one time when the lady was coming over and she looked like it appeared she was going to be wrapping up a roll for us but instead she just grabbed a satay and plopped it right in Audrey's mouth and at the very end of the meal she came over and noticed I was looking hot and she undid a napkin for me. I thought she was going to put it in my hands. Oh, no. She just came and rubbed my whole face right down. Oh yeah. Today we are having lunch at the Green Moss in Hoi An and this happens to be a cooking school but it has more of a casual feel. Basically, you choose two dishes from the menu and then you pay an additional two dollars and you get to go into the kitchen and cook it yourself. That is what we'll be doing. Believe me when I say this ""If I can do it. Anyone can."" We are entering into the kitchen and we're making a cooking video. Audrey is up first. First like this? You roll one time. So you cover it up? So then we get the sides tucked in? And then we finish as tight as possible. There you go. Not so bad. It is great. It is like we're an exclusive peak into the kitchen. This is how we're making Pho. Can I try? Two tablespoons. Here are the first few dishes we've prepared. We have the Pho and the fresh spring rolls. Let's go eat it. Take them to the table and devour them. Here is the spring roll that Audrey personally rolled herself. No, I didn't. You rolled it. Do you remember? Let's see how it turned out. This is one of my favorite dishes at this restaurant. It is just such a nice fat spring roll. How is that Pho? Delicious, and prior to learning how to make this I didn't realize how many different ingredients went into this dish. You can really taste the flavors. Next up we will be making a vegetable Cao Lau. So the Cao Lau noodles are made from the water used an ancient well and apparently it is quite secret. Not only in Hoi An. Unique noodles to Hoi An. It is harder. It's a crispy noodle. Now we're making our very last dish the vegetable pancake and it happens to be my favorite one. We've got a lot of multitasking going on. We've got the tofu simmering, we've got the noodles being steamed over here and we've got the pancake mixture ready to be spread on the frying pan. So that is when we know it is done? Okay. Take fermented soy bean sauce. Here is the finished product and this is round two of our feast. It was a fascinating experience getting to see how all of this food was made in the kitchen. We're going to show you how to roll the country pancake in a rice paper, so that it is easy for dipping into the sauce. And a big bite. Oh, yeah. The pancake is nice and crispy and the sauce is kind of sweet. It has a bit of a tomato ketchup base I believe but it is also spicy because we added all of the chilies. It is a nice combination of flavors. How is the Cao Lau? I love it. What really stands out with the Cao lau is the taste of the noodles. They are just really unique to this area and I love them. So the texture of the noodles are a little bit crispy and it almost tastes a little bit like they are under-cooked but that is what makes them quite unique. We just finished our cooking class at Green Moss and it was a little bit different from previous cooking classes we've taken. This one was a little bit less hands on and more watch and learn, which is great because we got to watch a professional make it and the dishes turned out great. Everything was tasty. That is the first kind of cooking class where it has been more of a just a demonstration only that I've taken before. And I really enjoyed it partly because I'm really slow at preparing food but the other reason was it was so hot in that kitchen. I don't think I've ever sweated that much, so I could barely handle being in there as long as I was. Had I been preparing the food I may have passed out on the ground. Today we are having lunch at the Mermaid Restaurant in Hoi An. This is a very famous restaurant in town and that is because it has two very special secret recipes, so we are going to be trying those two dishes today. The first dish that we are going to be introducing you to is called White Rose. As you can see over here it is a shrimp dumpling made using a translucent dough and it was named 'White Rose' when the French came because they thought it looked like a flower the way it is all bunched up together. It is a secret recipe unique to Hoi An and supplied by one family to the rest of the town. I'm going to pick this one up as you can see it looks like a little rose. How does it taste? It is really tasty. It has a nice shrimp paste and it also has some roasted garlic on top, so it has a really nice flavor. The next dish that we're going to be trying is called Cao Lau. It consists of noodles, pork and greens. It is also unique to Hoi An. The Cao Lau gets its special flavor from the water that comes from a well outside of the town. Or this distinct taste could just be from its spice caramelized broth. Delicious noodles. They remind me a lot of the Japanese Udon noodles. The meat is really chewy and flavorful and you can tell it has been sitting in the broth for a little while. This meal came to about five US Dollars which is a bit pricey for a local dish but then again we are eating at a famous restaurant with two secret recipes so that is what you pay. So today we are going to a local restaurant in Nha Trang. It is called Au Lac and it is the kind of restaurant that doesn't even have a menu. You just go in there and sit down and they bring you a plate of food. That is what you get. Pure vegetarian feast. Tofu central. And we are here. So here we are just piling on everything. All kinds of different veggies; there is different tofu. This is a typical meal at Au Lac. Essentially it is just a big plate of rice and on top they pile lots of veggies, different tofu. It is just a healthy meal that tastes great and it is cheap. How is the tofu? The best tofu I've had. Ever? Ever! Wow! That's pretty good. So we got a little soup with our meal and it has cucumber and zucchini and also centro. Nice flavors. So tell us how much did that vegetarian feast cost? It cost thirty five thousand dong, which if you're doing the math is one dollar and seventy five cents US. That's not per person. That is total. For two soups, two plates of rice covered in vegetables and tofu. What a deal! One of the best tips I have for saving money while backpacking is to eat at local joints and restaurants because you'll get authentic food at rock bottom cheap prices. Tonight we're dining at a restaurant called Lanterns. It is an immensely popular restaurant. This place is just packed. One of the reasons we like this restaurant is that they are very involved in the community. They help out orphanages by donating school supplies and every week they cook meals for those who need it and just hand out free food. Okay, so what are you having today? We've got a lemongrass tofu dish that we first tried when we were cruising along the Mekong and it was delicious at the time, so we have expectations about this one here tonight. That's good. It has got a bit of a sweet and sour flavor but you can really taste the lemongrass, which accentuates things. What do you have over here? I'm having a claypot dish. This one is made with shrimp. It is like a thick stew or a really flavorful thick soup. It is sweet yeah. The shrimp clay pot is made with caramelized onions which gives it that kind of caramel like sweet flavor. Oh, is it ever good. We've been eating a lot of tofu dishes in Vietnam and this one does not disappoint. It is really spicy but it is also sweet at the same time, so it is a nice mix. Overall, this was an excellent meal. I feel it was the perfect intersection between price and quality. I'd definitely come back. I've heard they've got a great hot pot, so maybe we'll make a hotpot video really soon.",False,20140714 - Vietnamese Cuisine ∩╝Ü An Introdution to Vietnamese Food.en.srt

It is lunchtime here in Melaka and today we're eating at the Selvam Banana Leaf restaurant, which is an Indian restaurant. We've been here several times during the week. It is one of our favorite places so far. It is really popular with locals, so we're going to show you what a Thali set meal looks like. When I was backpacking in India three and a half years ago I subsisted off of Thali, so I'm thrilled to be having the opportunity to eat it again here in Malacca, Malaysia. Thali is an Indian meal that consists of various kinds of dishes. It can be served on a platter or - in this case- we're having it on a banana leaf if you take a look at it down here. It comes with different vegetables, curries and rice. Typically you would eat this using your hand; however, someone has to hold the camera, so I'm going to be using cutlery and Sam will demonstrate how it is done the proper way. Alright boy, dig in. Get them fingers dirty. You mix it around here. There we go. That's awesome stuff. Sam and I ordered two different Thali sets. He is having the vegetarian one and I am having the chicken but the only difference is that I get a little plate with a chicken curry on the side. Everything else we got was the same. We have the same dhal, the same rice and the same chips. Take a bite of that chicken to see how it tastes. I already have a chunk here. It is very tender and you can tell it has been cooked slowly for a long time. It is really good. Is it spicy? Of course, a bit of Indian spice in there. One thing I absolutely love about Thali is the concept of the bottomless refills. You eat until you're fully satisfied. That means if you go through your rice - and you finished your rice and you want more - you call them over and they load you up. It is perfect for a hungry boy. Our Thali lunch came to 22 Ringgit which is roughly $7 USD and that included three drinks, two different Thali sets (including a chicken and a vegetarian) and a roti pisang banana flat bread for dessert. For breakfast this morning we're having one of my all-time favorite foods - dim sum - and there are so many restaurants to choose from here in George Town but I'm going to my favorite. Let's go. There is a recurring theme in most of our morning videos and that is I'm usually not awake and that I'm being dragged out of bed to go do something. This morning it is Chinese breakfast again. What do we got? I believe those are shrimp dumplings. Could I have a cup of tea darling? You may and this is very hot. Burning yourself for love. No dim sum meal is complete without a cup of tea. Sam and his buns. Barbecue pork bun and red bean paste bun. One of the most fascinating aspects of eating at this dim sum restaurant is just how you order the food. All of the different ladies come by pushing these different kinds of carts some of them filled with dim sum and some of them are filled with pao. There are different kinds of buns. They have pork and all kinds of things. You just pick them and they put them right on the table. They have this little bill here and they check them off with the prices. You can see our bill right now and how it is shaping up. I'm sure we'll be ordering more. Which one did you try just now? I got a shrimp and veggie one and it is so tasty. Have a look? One of my absolute favorites is the barbecue pork bun. It just has so much flavor and it is 'wow' delicious. We've been trying lots of different dim sum. I find that the fillings are varied. You can get vegetables, pork and there are some with shrimp and then you have all of the sweet dim sum, which have a red bean paste. Those are the ones I like the most. The ones that I'm not a huge fan of. Again, lots of different variety. One of my favorite things about having dim sum is the social aspect. It is the kind of meal that you come and enjoy with friends over a cup of tea. I'm so full yet I keep eating more. Sam is certainly in his element over here. Today we are having dinner at a great little restaurant that is located right across from the Puduraya bus terminal in Kuala Lumpur and it is Indian food. My favorite! Nothing like refreshing fruit drinks to start your meal. Here is our food. Nice! Thank you! Delicious. What we are having today is called Roti Canai and it is an Indian flat bread. I've got one that has cheese inside and I'm going to dip it in the curry sauce. The roti canai is the Malaysian form of flat bread. Oh yeah! What we're having here is roti canai. Roti means bread in Hindi and Malay. Canai in Malay means to roll out the dough. How do you roll it out? Show us. Nice. It is made with egg flour and water and in special cases where there is special ingredients like this one here - cheese! Sam is feeling a little shy because there is people watching him eat right now. Is it the freckles? Is it the t-shirt? Is it because he is using his hands? It's s spectacle. What could it be? There are two ways to eat roti canai - by hand or by utensil - and believe me I will not give up an opportunity to use my hands. Demonstrate for us. Mix it up really good. That's sloppy! You just wiped it on your pants! No, I didn't. Audrey here will be having it using utensils. I on the other hand am eating like a lady using a fork and spoon. Keeping it classy. So roti canai is thinner than the Indian style Naan bread which a lot of people are more familiar with. It is thin in the same way as chapati for example. You can get plain roti or you get a little fancier with your order and they have banana roti, garlic roti, cheese roti and egg roti. Yes, I had that earlier. Lots to choose from! One of the coolest things when we come here to the restaurant is the little order you get. You just keep tallying it up here on the side and eventually when you're finished feasting they finally give you a total. This is a meal that you can have for breakfast, lunch or dinner. We're having it for dinner right now and I'm pretty sure I'll be coming back for breakfast. Get ready! Okay, so what are you eating right now? Well, nothing better to do at the night market (the Jonker street night market) than to indulge in street food. We've got a refreshing little dish right down here. Take a look at it. Different kinds of jellies, beans and shaved ice with sweet coconut milk and cane syrup. Oh, is it ever good. The perfect way to beat the heat. Okay, so right here we've ordered something that is called carrot cake. I am not seeing any carrots so far but it looks really tasty. Let's see what this is. It smells good. Is it good? How would you describe it? I would say it is like a Pad Thai without the noodles. You have the bean sprouts, you have a little bit of tofu and some egg, peanuts. I don't know where the carrot name comes from. So I just bought some sugarcane juice. It is really sweet and refreshing. I love that they gave us lots of ice. It is perfect. It's perfect for a hot night like this. It is lunchtime here in Malacca, so we're about to go to a Baba Nyonya type of restaurant, which is a mix of Chinese and Malaysian cuisine. This is a real hole in the wall kind of place. It is. I am going to be showing you the Nyonya Laksa, which is spicy curry with a mixture of Malay and Chinese elements. Let's take a look. It is a coconut based curry soup and it has curd puffs, fish sticks, shrimp and clams added to it. It is very flavorful. What I am having next is called Rojak, which is the Malay word for mixture. It is a refreshing salad. Yes. Take a look over here. It is made using fruits and vegetables, so it has pineapple, cucumbers, bean sprouts. It is just a really nice and refreshing salad on a hot day. Oh yeah. The last of our four dishes is called Popiah and it is a spring roll that has an outside like a crepe. I'll show you the ingredients here. It has a sweet bean and soy sauce and it often has turnips and bean sprouts, tofu, peanuts and kind of omelet like. It has got everything going on. Take a bite. Classy! To beat the heat we have some lime juice. Is that refreshing? What has been your favorite dish so far? I've actually like this one here - the Nyonya dumplings - as I've never had this one before. I've tried the others but this is my first time for this. Okay, take a big bite and tell us why you like it. Struggling! What I really like about it is the glutinous rice. It is a unique kind of coating for the dumpling. Also, it is quite sweet inside. It is hard for me not to like sweet foods when it comes to me and my taste buds. What is Miss Audrey's favorite? Well, I've really enjoyed the rice dumplings as well but I think my absolute favorite has been the salad over here. I haven't eaten fresh fruits and fresh vegetables for almost a year because in Korea they cost a fortune, so I'm in heaven right now. I'm just eating and feasting on this. What do you got now - pineapple? Yeah, this is a pineapple. It is a nice sweet treat and the coating on the salad is delicious as well. It is a sweet sauce with peanuts on top, so it is just perfect. We are at our new favorite restaurant in George Town. It is called Kapitan. Restaurant Kapitan. They serve up amazing Indian food. If you like rich savory curries and buttery naans you have come to the right place. Over here we have a tandoori set which I got. It came with a buttery naan bread and some nice curries. We also have Alo Ghobi over here with potatoes and cauliflower and some extra Naan because we just like it so much. We need double the portion. That chicken is superb. It is juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Wow! What flavor. How is the curry? It's so good. So so good! Aside from being a great restaurant in terms of the quality of food, the other thing we really like about coming here is that it is so affordable. You can just pick a whole bunch of different dishes, mix and match and you'll get a great meal. One of our absolute favorite dishes so far has been the Palak Paneer, which is really delicious and we've also really enjoyed the Tandoori chicken which is always fresh, crispy and the butter naan. That is good. This is a 24 hour restaurant and we like it so much we're considering coming for breakfast, lunch, dinner and maybe even a snack. It's extremely hot this afternoon and there is only one way to beat the heat. I'd say it is about Cendol time. Must have Cendol! It is Cendol time! Thank you! Here we have our delicious treat. We are having Cendol right now and it is a dessert that is really popular in SE Asia. It is made using shaved ice, palm sugar and it has coconut milk along with little green worm-like creatures that are actually made using rice and beans. That is it. I honestly couldn't think of a more refreshing treat or dessert to beat this heat and humidity. It is just brilliant. What do you have there on that spoon? I've got some beans! Beans? Beans for dessert? That's a first. The green jellies here are actually made out of rice flour and they have sort of a worm like consistency. Green worms! No, they're fine. They're good. I'm a happy satisfied and most importantly refreshed customer. This special one that we're getting outside has a scoop of ice cream in it. It's even more delicious. Okay, what is this little treat? This little tasty treat here that comes in a bag and is five pieces. It is fried banana which was two Ringgit which is like sixty cents. So yummy? It is just as good indoors as it is outdoors. We are at Tek Sen restaurant in George Town in Penang today. Not to be confused with Texan food because this place is actually a Chinese restaurant. And it is spelled T-E-K S-E-N. Background music playing. So this is one of the most popular restaurants in all of Georgetown for locals and if you don't come at the right time you have to wait for a table. And if a restaurant is popular with locals I know I'm going to like it. Background music playing. So this here in the mapo tofu. Apparently, it is one of Sam's favorite dishes and I'm going to try it. Oh, it's so hot. It's like tofu mixed with ground beef in a really rich sauce that is kind of spicy. I like it. Background music playing. Oh, wow. Is that ever good. It's crispy chicken in a sweet plum sauce. Background music playing. That's just your standard fried rice with shrimp, a little bit of veggies and some meat. It's really tasty. Here are some Chinese chopsticks. Better. Background music playing. Nothing quite as refreshing as lime juice. Are delicious Malaysian Chinese feast came to thirty three Ringgit, which is roughly eleven US dollars and it was worth every single Ringgit.

Today we went to the supermarket and stocked up on some nice little treats. We're going to be sampling these today and telling you what they taste like. It appears most of these items are heavily skewed towards sweets and junk food, but that is not a problem for me. So first up we are going to be trying Shapes (Arnott's). These look like some savory crackers and they come in the shape of Australia. Here we have Australia in cracker form and we are actually here on the east coast in Queensland. It tastes like a pizza cracker. It is nice and salty. I could munch on these while watching a movie. Well, first up for me is Freckles. Because I don't have enough on my arm as it is. This is choc buds with hundreds and thousands of freckles. Let's give it a go. It is chocolate-y and crunchy. It is kind of strange. It is like these things are exploding in my mouth but it does taste good. It has a very chocolate-y taste. Yeah, thumbs up from me. Next up is a classic. This is Tim Tam original and the package says the most irresistible chocolate biscuit. Here is my first chocolate Tim Tam. I already like the smell of it. Okay. It is like a chocolate cookie with a nice creamy chocolate filling in the middle and it is covered in chocolate. I can't complain. That is a lot of chocolate-y goodness. We've got Bowen Mango Macadamias. These are chocolate covered macadamias with mango flavor. We actually went to Bowen and it is the home of the biggest artificial mango I have ever seen. It was just this massive mango structure. Bowen is known for its mangoes, so let's give this a try. It looks pretty big. I'm going to eat the whole thing. Wow. I'll tell you what. I love mangoes. I love chocolate and I love macadamia. This is really good. I'm not sure how this is pronounced. I think it is Fantales maybe. Honestly, I'm not so sure I'm going to like it just based on the look of the package but we'll see. It looks like chocolate. Oh my. Okay, it is very chewy. Very very chewy. It is getting stuck on my teeth. This actually reminds me of the kind of candy that your Grandmother would have in her purse. So I don't like it. Hahaha. Okay, next up we've got some weird looking candy here: Chicos. I don't really know what is going on but it'll be interesting to try these. These are pretty bizarre. They look like naked little babies. I'm going to be gobbling up one of these. It is really chewy. That's not good at all. I think it is trying to be chocolate-y but it is just so artificially flavored. No thanks. Next up is Lamington. This is a soft sponge cake that is coated in rich chocolate. Coconut-y. Okay. This is a pleasant surprise. Honestly, in the supermarket we could only find the Weight Watchers variety so I thought it was going to be a little bit bland and not very sweet. But it is actually a nice cake. It is very soft and very spongy. It has a thin layer of chocolate, so it is not overwhelming and I really like the shredded coconut over top. This would be nice with a cup of tea. Chokito. Chokito. Fifty five grams of chewy caramel, fudge, crunchy balls and loads of chocolate. I think I'm going to like this one. Ooh, it is kind of shaped like an O'Henry bar. Oh, I can taste all of that caramel and fudge. This is a really really good chocolate bar. This would do well in Canada and US. Next up I'm having a bar called Violet Crumble. I really like the tagline on this. I says, ""It's the way it shatters that matters."" I think it is going to be really crunchy. I'm not sure what the filling is. It looks dry. Like a dry sponge. That is crunchy. It is like coffee meringue. This is surprising. Or maybe really crunchy caramel mixed in with meringue. I'm kind of confused about this one but it is super sugary and sweet so I do like it. Next up is Cherry Ripe - the big cherry taste. I just had a friend on twitter tell me that I'm going to get addicted to this, so I better watch out. Alright, I think I'm ready for the big cherry flavor. It taste coconut-y too but you can really taste the cherries. I think my friend is right. I better not have too many of these or I may get addicted. Okay, so here we have a Mint Pattie and again it looks like we accidentally picked out the diet variety. It says 50% less fat. We'll see what it is like. I hope it tastes like the After Eight chocolate squares because I really like those. Okay. It doesn't have a very strong peppermint flavor. It is more like a hint of it. The filling is also a little bit chewy. Yep, I do like it. I'm giving it the thumbs up. These are Anzac biscuits. We were just around Australia for Anzac day. This will be interesting to try as well. These smell good. They smell very buttery. Oh wow. That is a lot crunchier than I thought they'd be. That is a nice cookie. It is very rich and as expected also very buttery. This is Kirk's Originals. We've actually been seeing this brand a lot here in Australia. I'm going to be sampling the Ginger Beer. It is called Olde Stoney and it says Australian made since 1865. Alright, so this is already smelling like medicine. It has a really strong ginger flavor and it doesn't really smell artificial. This seems like the real stuff. Sam wants me to chug it like a man, so I'll do my best. It has a strong aftertaste. You don't really taste the ginger at first but once you swallow it is like the ginger is here. I don't know. I'm not convinced yet. It probably wouldn't be my first choice for a beverage. Let's leave it at that. Bundaberg. Another kind of ginger beer. And we've become so famous in Australia that look - our photos are on the cover. Hahaha. Yeah, right. We've staying in Pepper's Hotel in Broad Beach, which is located in the Gold Coast. And to surprise us they gave us these beverages with our faces on them. I think I'm almost obligated to like this here. You're guzzling that. Gingery gingery goodness. I love anything with ginger. Yeah, this is something I would actually endorse this. Overall, this was a really pleasant surprise that I liked - I don't know - over 90% of the things I tried. My favorite being the Chokito bar followed by the Cherry Ripe bar, which is hardly a surprise because I really have a sweet tooth. The only thing I really didn't like were these Chicos. They were not tasty. Okay, so for my favorites I'm going with the Shapes crackers. I thought these were really tasty and really flavorful. Kind of like pizza. Yeah, a nice snack. And I also really enjoyed the Lamingtons. They were a pleasant surprise. I was expecting them to be a little bit bland so these were nice. I like shredded coconut so it was a good combo. If you ever find yourself in Australia now you have some ideas of treats you can try. These can easily be found in a local supermarket and they don't cost very much. So enjoy! For today's food challenge we are trying Vegemite for breakfast. This is really popular here in Australia and we received lots of comments on YouTube of people asking us to try this. Let's see how we like it. Before we eat the Vegemite I'm just going to read a little bit of information about it. It says Vegemite is a dark brown Australian food paste made from leftover Brewer's Yeast extract with various vegetable and spice additives. Apparently, Vegemite is quite healthy. It has got B1, which is essential for brain function; B2, supports your nervous system; B3, essential for energy release and folate helps to fight fatigue. But the question is does it taste good? And I was also looking at the Vegemite website and it says Vegemite is a nutritious and undeniably delicious start to the day. Now, I'm not really convinced because I've watched some people eat this and the reaction is just disasterous. We're going to try it out and see whether we like it or not. We're slathering on that butter here. This isn't going to be thin. We've got a thick amount here. Before we spread this bad boy sauce all over our toast let's have a little sniff test. Wow, that is strong! Very repugnant. Alright, let's put some of this on. Wow, that is really thick and dark. It is almost like a Nutella spread here. I think it is supposed to be a thin layer. Ooops. Alright, it is time. Time for the first bite. I'm going to take a big massive bite. There is no wimping out here. Just a giant bite of this. It's freakin' awful. I wouldn't give this stuff to my worst enemy. I think Sam put on way too much Vegemite, so I am making my own toast. Or bread actually because I don't like toast my bread. I'm not going overboard here. I'm just putting a very thin layer like I was advised by Australians. Hopefully this tastes better than what Sam had. What you're doing is wimping out. No way. So here we go - my first bite of Vegemite ever. I also have a glass of Mango juice nearby in case I need it. You know what? I think I may it the right way because this is not awful. I can actually eat this for breakfast. It is just a little bit salty but it is not as overpowering as Sam's reaction. I ate my bread with butter but I've also heard Australian's say that you can eat this with avocado, so I think that actually might taste nice. Maybe we can try that next time. So I have to say a thumbs down. I'm giving it a thumbs up. There are a lot of foods that I've tried around the world that other people can consider strange or an acquired taste. Quite often I'm the one who likes them whereas Audrey doesn't. A good example of that is Salmiakki in Finland, which is a very salty black licorice, which I loved and Audrey hated. But this is something I don't think I would ever like to eat. Arrrwwww it is awful. Well, surprisingly I did enjoy this stuff so I guess I'm going to be eating for breakfast. And since we have two jars I may be bringing one home back to Canada for my family. Get ready. The other day we made a video where we sampled lots of Australian snacks and one of them was the Tim Tam. I just opened the pack and ate a cookie. That is how I sampled it but then I got lots of comments from people saying you have to do a Tim Tam slam. That is what we're going to be doing today. First off, what exactly is a Tim Tam? It is a chocolate biscuit with a cream chocolate filling covered in chocolate. The whole idea behind a Tim Tam slam is that you use the biscuit as a straw. You need to bite the top end and the bottom end off, stick it in the cup and slurp. That is going to melt the chocolate inside and it is going to make the cookie really nice gooey. We're going to be doing this. The first part of the slam is to bite off both ends of this biscuit. That is exactly what I'm going to do. I've got one done. The idea is to use it like a straw with a hot beverage. I've got some tea here. I've got my Tim Tam ready. It is time to give it a try. Mmmmm...that is good. Oh, it is melting and getting gooey. Look at that? Woah! That is delicious. It kind of reminds me of how a deep-fried chocolate bar tastes. It is kind of like what we had in Edinburgh when we had a deep-fried Mars bar. It totally melts it. Look at that. I've got gunk all over my hands. I'm going to be doing mine a little bit different. I'm actually going to be biting off each of the corners instead of the entire top. I've seen some people do it that way, so we'll give it a try. One. Two. Okay, let's see if this works. Mmmm. It does work. Wow! Okay. Before it disappears. It worked! That is seriously delicious. It is the best way ever to eat a Tim Tam. The verdict on this one: we are giving it the thumbs up.

Now, I'm really looking forward to meeting a kangaroo because I've never been up close to one, so hopefully I'll get to feed one. And I'm most looking forward to feeding lorikeets - a very colorful and energetic bird. During our visit to Currumbin National Park, we had a chance to get up close and personal with Kangaroos. Feeding and petting the Roos was one of the top highlights of visiting Currumbin. And who could forget doing the ultimate thing - taking a Kangaroo selfie;) Spotting animals we had previously never heard of was also part of the program, including the orange tree Kangaroo and one of Australia's most dangerous birds the Cassowary. And no trip to Currumbin would be complete without spending a little bit of quality time with the adorable koalas. Overall, we had a really cool experience here. I like that it had more of a conservation environment as opposed to being like a zoo. We had the opportunity to get up close and interact with the animals and it was also very educational. So someone got themselves a new souvenir. Check it out. I'm loving it so far. It is light, it is cool and feels awesome on the head. Boarding the Derwent Hunter, we went sailing along the Whitsunday Islands of the Great Barrier Reef located in Queensland, Australia. It's a beautiful day here in the Whitsunday Islands. Today we are going to be doing a full day cruise and maybe a little bit of snorkeling. Join us for the adventure. We're going to show you around this national park. Our journey began by raising the sails as passengers on board helped out. After sailing for a while we had the chance to enjoy some beach time with an opportunity to go snorkeling. The warm turquoise waters were inviting as we splashed around while writing in the sand. We couldn't help but marvel at the amazing scenery. Our journey included time ashore at Langford Reef and Bali Hai where we had a chance to learn about the incredible biodiversity. Relaxing on the boat we looked out at the scenery, read our kindles and munched on delicious chocolate cake. We then visited a second island where we spent time walking along the beach, taking photos and drawing our names in the sand. It was certainly a day we'll never forget. Located just a few kilometers from Townsville, Magnetic Island was the perfect city getaway. The island offers lots of walking trails, great beaches and a hint of rugged charm. Here is a look at some of the activities we got to try during our visit to Maggie Island. We are here at the Horseshoe Ranch at the north end of the island and we are going to be going horseback riding. That was actually a really fun ride. We just finished riding our horses through the bush and one of my favorite parts was getting to see Wallabies in the wild just hopping around as we were passing through with our horses. If you find yourself on Magnetic Island going horseback riding is a lot of fun. This morning here on Magnetic Island we are going to be doing something pretty cool. We've gotten up really early and we are having a Bush Tucker breakfast, which is meant to be a very traditional breakfast, so we're going to show you what that is like. We also got to try a Bush Tucker Champagne breakfast which featured a delicious spread of food including pancakes, fresh fruit and grilled meats. And after breakfast we're going to be doing something really cool. We're going to have authentic Australian animal encounters. We're going to be putting snakes around our necks, hugging koalas and you have never had a snake around your neck, so this should be kind of interesting. So how is that? It is good. We have some free time this afternoon on the island and we've decided to do the Magnetic Island forts walk, which is supposed to be 4 kilometers. It is a return trip and it should take about an hour and a half. This is supposed to be Northern Australian's largest colony of Koalas in the wild. Hopefully we'll be able to spot a koala or two. Well, so far it has been a fascinating hike but we haven't seen any koalas yet. But the one thing that is happening is that I'm sweating profusely, so I'm going to guzzle some water here. We are here in Nelly Bay. We were just enjoying a walk along the waterfront and we noticed that there are some Wallabies over there on the rocks. Now I've never seen Wallabies before but I think they look a lot like small kangaroos, so they are pretty cute. I was kind of surprised to see them here because they usually hangout in Arcadia by Jeffery beach so it was a nice little surprise. Now we're in the northern part of Magnetic Island or as locals like to call it Maggie Island and this is Horseshoe Bay. What we're going to be doing here is just taking a nice beachfront walk. Our time on Magnetic Island was a nice balance of adventure and relaxation. If you ever find yourself in Queensland we highly recommend this little spot. We are here at the Horseshoe Ranch on the north end of the island and we are going to be going horseback riding. I'm going to be riding a horse called Little Man and Sam who are you riding? I can't remember. Hello, Little Man. Hi Choci Brown. You're going to be my horse today. That was actually a really fun ride. We just finished riding our horses through the bush and one of my favorite parts was getting to see Wallabees in the wild just hopping around while we were passing through on our horses. It was really cool. Also, what makes this experience unique is that at the end of the horseback riding lesson you get to go swimming with the horses in the ocean. That is what a lot of the riders are doing right now. If you find yourself on Magnetic Island going horseback riding is a lot of fun. Today we're going to be doing something really cool. We're going to have authentic Australian animal encounters. We're going to be putting snakes around our necks, hugging koalas and you have never had a snake around your neck so this should be kind of interesting. Our morning at Bungalow Bay Koala Village was the perfect opportunity to get up close with some of Australia's local wildlife. First we met various lizards, including the the two-headed lizard which has a tail that resembles the shape of its head. Next it was time to hold a snake. I was quite nervous about it at first, but the ranger reassured me that this non-venomous python was one of the most well-behaved snakes she had every encountered. That was enough to get me to wrap it around my neck. How is that? It is good. And lastly, we had the opportunity to hold cute koalas. These sleepy little creatures spend up to 20 hours a day napping, and the one we met dozed off right after its photo op. Coming from Canada, these were animals that neither Sam nor I had ever seen before. It is amazing the kinds of new hobbies you can pick up while on the road. Over the last year we've had the opportunity to try kayaking in both Vietnam and Finland. When the opportunity came to try it in the Whitsundays with Salty Dog we jumped at the chance. At times it was hard to concentrate on paddling given the spectacular scenery of the Whitsunday Islands. During the outing we also got to spend a bit of time relaxing on an island with a pristine beach. Overall, we'd recommend sea kayaking to just about anyone given that it is a safe and fun activity. We are here in Australia. This is a completely new country for Sam and I. We are going to be exploring Queensland for the next two weeks. We're actually starting our trip off here in Townsville and this morning we're going to be climbing Castle Hill, which you can actually see over here in the distance. Rising to a height of some 286 meters above sea level. Castle Hill, a pink granite monolith, dominates Townsville as its most iconic landmark. Having the opportunity to hike up to the top was something we couldn't pass up. This moderately challenging hike was certainly a good workout. We noticed many locals exercising along the way. There are a number of vantage points on the way up but nothing beats the landscapes from the very top where we had three hundred and sixty degree views of the city below. Overall, that was a really cool climb. Climbing all the way up there. We had 360 degree views of the entire city, which was phenomenal. Luckily the weather really cooperated for us as well. That is it for our time in Townsville. Now we're off to Magnetic Island. So they say you should do at least one thing that scares you every day. For me it is going to be riding the Ocean Jet. I am terrified. This is supposed to be like the roller coaster of the sea but we're heading on it today. Are you excited? After buckling up we began our Turbo Jet adventure. This 880 horsepower vessel ripped through the water like a speeding race car. We headed out into the ocean and when our skipper gave us the signal it indicated that he was going to do a 360 degree power turn. We ended up using all of our courage points for the day with every sudden jolt. It is a like a roller-coaster out on the sea. It was a white knuckle adventure. A total adrenaline rush. The best part was when they were doing the 360's. Oh, that was crazy.",False,20140708 - Things to do in Queensland Travel Guide (Australia).en.srt

Coming back home to Canada with Audrey, after nearly three consecutive years of traveling overseas, has rekindled our passion to explore more of our own backyard. When we had the opportunity in our schedule to visit Montreal we jumped at the chance. When deciding whether or not to take the bus or train, it was an easy decision. Train travel is our preferred method of transportation, so we decided to go with Via Rail. What I immediately noticed was just how much more comfortable it was to be traveling via rail as opposed to flying or taking the bus. Extra leg room. Check. Wifi. Check. Plugins for my computer. Check. The ability to easily get up and stretch or order food on demand. Check. Now that I'm in my thirties those little things make a big difference. We passed by cities like Kingston and Cornwall along the way and my desire to explore some of the smaller cities in this region is now greater than ever. Overall, if you're thinking of doing the Toronto to Montreal route - or vice versa - I can't think of a better way than to do it by train.",False,20140703 - Our train ride from Toronto to Montreal with Via Rail Canada.en.srt

It is called Imm Aim and it used to be called Pun Pun, so that is what we're searching for right now. It is a vegetarian restaurant and it has come highly recommended from a friend but before we go have lunch we're going to go for a wander around the temple. So far I'm kind of enjoying the minimal design here and they have a really cool outdoor open kitchen. You can see them preparing your food. The do it yourself water reminds me a lot of being back in Korea where we used to eat at the Kimbap restaurants and we would go up and grab our own waters. Our first dish has arrived - the vegetarian spring rolls. It is hot. I'm burning my mouth but this is really good. These are definitely some of the best spring rolls I've had here in Chiang Mai. Have a look inside. It has bean sprouts, glass noodles, some vegetables. It is really flavorful. They've added some nice spices in there. There comes the rest of our food. It looks amazing. Let's get back to your spring roll. I got distracted there. Have a bite! Yeah, these are excellent. My favorite part about this is the tamarind dipping sauce. That is really unique and tangy. The masterpiece of a salad has arrived. Ooh lah lah. What kind of sauce is that? I think it may be pumpkin based on the color. We'll see. This is a really healthy salad. If you look over here you can see we have some green beans, red beans, corn and there is even some barley and of course we love cheese so we had to get some feta cheese on top. Only an extra 20 Baht. I would say it was well worth it. Oh, yes. How is it? That's wonderful. So good you've have three bites and I haven't had any. We have a little taste of India happening over here. Indeed, we do. This here is a little bit of roti flat bread and this is the Indian curry. I don't really know what is in it so it'll be an interesting first bite. It is nice and thick. I can tell that. It looks like it has a lot of vegetables. That's wonderful. It has got a coconut base. It is spicy and yeah I can taste a lot of different vegetables in there. That would be our dessert. This was listed as sweet potato honey. Sweet potato tea on the menu, so I was expecting a tea cup but apparently it is a dessert. Tea in a spoon. It tastes like ginger. That is ginger tea. That is not sweet potato. This is my dessert which I'm kindly sharing with Sam. Oh, yeah, I don't recall that part of the deal. Anyways, we're having bananas with coconut milk and if you look down here you can see giant slabs of banana. I'm going to take one of those and make sure I've got lots of coconut milk too. That is the face of satisfaction. Yeah? That awesome feast came to 300 Baht which is 10 USD and that included two shakes, three main dishes and two desserts. That is a lot of food for ten dollars for two people. So today we are having lunch at a little place called the Peppermint cafe. This is in some little back-alley in Chiang Mai. We're sitting outside right by the street and we're going to enjoy some more Northern Thai food. And you know how much we like our back-alley restaurants. Background music playing. We're here for original Thai food and good shakes. Looks like you got just that. So today we are having a dish that is called Khao Soi and if you just look down over here you can see that it kind of looks like a curry type soup and we have regular boiled noodles, some crispy noodles and chicken over top. So this is a Burmese influenced dish from Northern Thailand and it literally means cut rice. This is one of Northern Thailand's most famous dishes. background music playing. So I've had this dish once before and I think my favorite part is the combination of the soft egg noodles mixed in with the crispy ones. It's just a nice, crunchy, soft texture and the curry sauce gives it a bit of an extra kick, so here we go. I love coconut based curries and this is quite similar to Massaman Curry. background music playing. This is a really popular street food in Northern Thailand. It's actually quite hard to find overseas in Thai restaurants, so that means you have to come to Northern Thailand and try it for yourself. Empty plate over here. The sign of a good meal. Overall, that meal was delicious and coming in at just 59 Baht per dish - what value! It is Saturday Night in Chiang Mai and today we are heading to the Saturday Night market. Well, we're still a few blocks away but I know we're close - you know why? - because I can smell the food. What do you got there? I got myself a twist potato, which is a lot like the tornado chips we used to have in Korea. It looks like it is all seasoned. It is nice. It is barbecue flavored. You are going to be sharing that! You are wasting the chips. Yeah, that's blueberry. It looks like blueberry cheesecake with ice cream. It is going to be messy. Snow ice cream with blueberry sauce drizzled over top. How articulate. Mmmmmm. What did you get? I've got some pan-fried dumplings. They are very similar to the Korean gun mandu we often had when we were living as teachers in Korea. Let's see if these are as good. They look hot. They're pretty good. Someone found his favorites here. What started as just a little snack out here at the market has turned out to be a full on feast. I've got dim sum and fried spring rolls. Looking good. I got this - German sausage. It is very good. Krap. In case, we didn't quite have enough to eat - a sweet little dessert treat. That is banana egg roti with lots of chocolate and condensed milk drizzled over top. So today we are back at our favorite Thai restaurant but we're going to be having a special meal. We have ordered a set for two people that focuses on Northern Thai dishes, so we are going to get a sampling of different curries that come along with sticky rice. And this is what it might look like. Our first dish has arrived and it is called Khao Soi and it is fried noodles on top of a hearty curry. That looks amazing. It does. Let's dig into that baby. I'm going to try my first fried noodle. I've never had anything like this. It's kind of nice and the curry is kind of spicy. How is that? It's a very flavorful spicy curry. I can tell it is made from coconut milk. It's not a very thick curry. It is more stew-like and soup-y but it is really nice on a warm day like this. I'm enjoying it. Sticky rice inside. So a lot of the Northern Thai dishes have pork in them, so as you can see over here we have a pork sausage. We have something that looks like ground pork with nice green herbs and this might also be pork if you ask me. One of the characteristic elements of Northern Thai food is that you eat your side dishes with sticky rice. This is going to be tasty. So I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be using my hands or not but because this is sticky rice I am. We're going to dip it over here and see how it tastes. Spicy or sweet? This one is surprisingly sweet. So I'm going to try one of these little puffs in another kind of dipping sauce. That looks like it could be spicy. Yeah, it is spicy. Burning your mouth? We also have a nice pumpkin stew over here with tofu. Spicy? Not spicy. It's just really hot. Okay, what is next? So next up in the dishes to try here would be the ground pork. It looks like it has been marinated in a nice little sauce. Very strong flavor with the sauce. It looks like soy sauce but that is hard going down. Very tasty though. So it is only our first week in Chiang Mai in Northern Thailand but we are quite quickly discovering that this part of the country has a lot to offer in the cooking department. Normally, when you think Thai food you think of Pad Thai, Green Curries but really there is so much variety here. Today we had dishes that we had never even heard of before and they were so tasty. We still don't even know exactly what they are. We don't know the n ames. I'm sure we will learn them over the course of our time here but for now what we can tell you is that Northern Thai food is really tasty. So just when we thought the meal was finally over and we are so stuffed they bring dessert out for us and it is amazing. So here you can see bananas. Those are just slices of bananas in a sweet, thick coconut cream and it is amazing really. Oh yeah, you need to try it. I want to see your face when you bite into that. Wow! It almost has a bit of a rum caramel type flavor which really accentuates the coconut milk. That was seriously the feast of feasts. We paid 300 Baht in total for that which is roughly ten US dollars and it was worth every penny or should I say every Baht. Background music playing. So we just came back to Chiang Mai after a Visa run in Penang, Malaysia and also a short little holiday in Phuket. Are we ever glad to be back. One of the main things that we missed about Chiang Mai was the street food that we get really close to our apartment. Today we're having one of our favorite meals. Background music playing. So let me give you a very special tour of my bowl. Ooh la la. So we have the yellow egg noodles. They look very nice. It also comes with some dumplings. Today it is pork. We also have slices of pork over here. Some bean sprouts and lots of greens, which add a lot of flavor to the soup. One of the things I love about this particular night stall stand is that we can add our own different spices exactly what we want. There is lots of chilly. That's what I'll be putting in mine. So I'm hardly putting any because this is super potent and I always end up making it way too spicy and then I can't finish my dish. Let's hope that is not too much this time. Noodles. I did make it too spicy again. Background music playing. So my favorite part about this dish is the wanton like dumplings. They are absolutely delicious and we're having pork dumplings today. Tasty? Oh, yeah. So you've seen us film a few other food videos at Chiang Mai gate, but the reason we keep coming back to this place is because there is so much variety. There are so many local foods that we can try, so we're constantly being introduced to new Thai meals. This is our favorite dining spot. Outdoors by the gate. Nice and cheap too. Samuel Jeffery, keeping it classy. You dripped! So the total for each meal is 35 Baht, which is just over a dollar. Background music playing. Background music playing. So we're still here at our favorite Thai restaurant Chang Chalaad and we're going to be having a delectable dessert. One of my absolute favorites and to be honest much like the Pad Thai this is also the best dish I've had here served at this particular restaurant. Background music playing. We've got ourselves a friendly little visitor here. Hello kitty cat. Meow. Background music playing. So for those who have never tried this dessert it's my favorite in Thailand. Basically, what it is sticky rice and on top of it you have these sweet condensed coconut milk, which obviously has some sugar added and then you have these wonderfully sliced mangoes. Background music playing. So I would like to preface this by saying that I hate rice. I don't ever eat rice back home. But this dessert has really changed my mind. I'd say it is better than chocolate and better than cheesecake. And those are my two favorites. So that's saying a lot. Mango sticky rice. You have to try it. Mmmmmmm. To me what makes this the best mango sticky rice, I've ever had is that the cream sauce is sticky and the coconut milk is quite thick. This is the creamiest I've ever had. Oh, this is sooo sooo good. So the price of our delicious mango sticky rice dessert is only 50 Baht which is about a dollar seventy five. Background music playing. So tonight we are at the food market right by Chiang Mai Gate. We actually came here looking for dumpling noodle soup but our favorite vendor is not here, so instead we are having dessert. Nothing quite like banana egg roti with chocolate sauce and we're going to show you how it is ordered and made. One, please. Background music playing. Speaking in Thai. Pounding noises. Sizzling sounds. Your face like Arabic. Pharaoh huh? Look like Pharaoh. Arabic. Do you eat now? Yes. Thank you. Chopping noises. Chocolate. Okay. Kop Kun Krap. Thank you. So this kind of banana pancake is popular all over SE Asia but this form being roti is quite different from the one we tried - especially in Malaysia. It's more thick. It's fluffier. It's got a lot of banana stuffed inside and it is just loaded with chocolate sauce and condensed milk. Background music playing. Ooh la la. Ready for the first bite. So good, so good that she is speechless. You can really taste the banana and the roti is very moist and wet with the chocolate sauce and the condensed milk. It's just really tasty and probably not the best thing to be eating since we're on a health kick but we need a little cheat every once in a while. Yeah, that's real good. The chocolate sauce is awesome. Even better though is nutella. If you can find a place making it with nutella that's pure bliss. So this delicious little dessert / snack was only 30 Baht which is one dollar. Background music playing. This is day three in Chiang Mai. We just moved here a few days ago and we already have a favorite restaurant called Chang Chalaad. Today we are going to be ordering some classic Thai meals. I've been to Thailand probably close to ten times and this place literally has the best Pad Thai I've ever had anywhere. I like this dish so much. That is why I can't stop smiling. So Pad Thai is the kind of dish you know even if you've never been to Thailand. You can get this back in Canada or really anywhere in the world. The ingredients - well, it is a noodle dishes as you can see. It also has tofu because we got the vegetarian version. It has egg, peanuts, beansprouts, peanut sauce. It's just so tasty, so filling, so good. So what makes this the best Pad Thai I've ever had? Well, it's especially the sauce. This is the most tangy, sweet and rich. It's almost a bit creamy sauce I've ever had on a Pad Thai. This must be a secret recipe because I've never had anything quite like this before. It is just really really unique. So Chang Chalaad is sort of this tiny little unassuming restaurant that I first visited back in 2008. It has incredible food, so that has always been one of my biggest travel tips to try out these little small places. Try out these places that aren't on trip advisor or the Lonely Planet. They are often the best places you can eat. So the price of the Pad Thai was only 60 Baht, which is two US dollars. What a deal! Music playing in the background. Welcome back to Thailand! We're back in Chiang Mai and the first thing I'm showing you is my grimy filthy hands. My bike just broke down in the middle of the road. We're planning on doing a food video at one of our favorite vegetarian restaurants but the first thing I'm showing you is my messed up bike. Background music. For lunch today we biked all the way out to a restaurant called 'Salad Concept' On the way here Sam's bicycle kind of died, so we had to leave it behind but we finally arrived and we're going to show you what this place is like. So the cool thing about this place is that you can build your own salad or build your own wrap and that's what we're going to be doing today. All kinds of different ingredients you can choose. Let's get a wrap with pumpkin. what else? feta cheese. Where is the feta? It's a premium topping. Music in the background. Alright, I've got my order picked out for my wrap. Let's see what is on it. Croutons, pasta, carrots, tomatoes, bell peppers, pumpkin, raisins, grilled bacon, avocado and feta with Caesar dressing. How does that sound to you? So you get a whole bunch of free toppings (I think five) and then you can add extra toppings to that for a few more Baht. After that bike incident I'm splurging right now. Background music. Well, it's berry berry good! This is a berry shake. Hahahaha I think I have shake envy. It looks better than the juice I got. So this drink over here is guava, apple and passion fruit and it is so refreshing and tangy. MMMMM, oh, it's a little sour and crunchy because of the seeds but it's still good. So I've been noticing a bit of a interesting phenomenon in the last few months of travel. I often order things that Audrey doesn't seem to want. I don't think I want that, I don't think that'll be good and then as soon as it is brought to the table Audrey has food envy and tries to eat half of it. I do. So this time around I've ordered exactly the same thing that you are getting. So I'll have my own. Now does that look good or does that look good. I think mine looks better. Check this out. It has avacodo, pumpkin, pasta, bacon, olives, feta cheese. Let me take a big bite. It's going to be good. Mmmmmm. Amazing! So happy. It almost makes up for the bicycle incident. Dig in. Wow! These are some of the best wraps I've ever had anywhere. So for me there are two star ingredients in this wrap. First of all, the pumpkin - it just makes it nice and sweet and also this wrap has raisins which is something I've never had in a wrap or sandwich before but it seems to be quite popular in Thailand, so let's take another bite because I mean the first one was soooo good. Oooh, it's falling apart - oh my. Can you give me a little bit of that? No! So the two ingredients that really make this wrap amazing for me are the Caesar salad and the feta cheese. The Caesar salad actually has a little bit of Dijon mustard and it gives it a real kick. And the feta, well what doesn't taste good with feta? Background music. Well, you know us we're not really big on dessert, so well I guess we're just going to have to have them. Here is the peanut butter brownie cheesecake and if that didn't look decadent enough take a look at this one. This is apple strudel cheesecake. That looks amazing. Audrey doesn't like cheesecake so I'll be having all of it. Oh, please. You wish! So this is a pretty nice brownie. It's very dark, heavy, chocolaty and on top it has a little bit of cheesecake and then some chocolate mousse. So much chocolate. Each bite is chocalier than the next. Is it like a chocolate explosion in your mouth? Okay, cheesecake strudel. Wow, I mean apple strudel on its own taste good. Cheesecake on its own is really good. Putting them together - thats like a superpower dessert. So, overall that meal was a bit of a splurge for us. It came to just over 600 Baht, which is roughly $20 USD. Oh my! In SE Asia that is a real splurge. Ten dollars per person. Normally we'd would spend half, 1/3 or if we were having a local Thai meal even a 1/4. But it was worth every Baht because it was tasty. This video is for all of our Korean fans. Background music playing. It's been ages since we've made a video. Well, after a year of living in Korea you know that you can't keep us too far away from Korean food, so 'yes' we are in Thailand. We are in Thailand but we are eating Korean food for dinner tonight. Background music playing. So the first dish we are having is Gun Mandu which is fried dumplings. This was one of my favorites back in Korea and this is really tasty. They did an excellent job. We normally had that at the Chungook Chip. The Chinese restaurants in Korea. Good stuff? Oh, yeah. It has been literally months since I've had kimchi. I've been missing this so much. This particular one is really sour, which I like. And here we have our Kaeran Jjim, which is sort of like an egg souffle and this is something we often had in Korea - especially when we were at barbecue places. So the Kaeranjjim is different from what we've had in Korea. This one is a bit more watered down and I have to say I do prefer the more authentic taste. So up next I am trying the kimchi jeon, which is kind of like a Korean pancake and it has lots of kimchi, so this should be really flavorful. Good stuff? It is nice and fluffy and you can really taste the kimchi and there is also a bit of spice in here. One of the big differences of eating Korean food here in Thailand is that the side dishes are not included. Normally in Korea side dishes are free and if you finish the whole thing they just keep refilling them for you, but over here we ordered six side dishes and that was 40 Baht, which is about a dollar and thirty three cents. It was still a bargain but it is not like Korea where you get it for free. And if the first serving wasn't enough we've just ordered a second helping of the pan-friend dumplings and the kimchi pancake. Background music playing. So the big question - what is Korean food like in Thailand? We had two dishes that we really loved. It was the gunmandu and the kimchjeon but we actually ended up ordering seconds because both dishes were so tasty; however, with kaeranjjim it wasn't as great as it is in Korea. I think part of the problem is that they don't use the stone pot which I think helps it boil better and maybe it just evaporates a bit in water. So for the kimch jeon, we ended up spending one hundred Baht, which is just over three dollars. Same for the gunmandu and the Kaeranjjim came in at 60 Baht which is two dollars. So, overall it was an affordable meal. Roughly with side dishes and water you're looking at about ten dollars or roughly 300 Baht. So if you're craving some Korean food and you find yourself in Chiang Mai, Thailand we highly recommend this little place. It is called Korea House.",False,"20140626 - Restaurants in Chiang Mai ∩╜£ Thai Food Travel Guide For The Best Eats In Chiang Mai, Thailand.en.srt"

Well, we're still a few blocks away but I know we're close - you know why? - because I can smell the food. What do you got there? I got myself a twist potato, which is a lot like the tornado chips we used to have in Korea. It looks like it is all seasoned. It is nice. It is barbecue flavored. You are going to be sharing that! You are wasting the chips. Yeah, that's blueberry. It looks like blueberry cheesecake with ice cream. It is going to be messy. Snow ice cream with blueberry sauce drizzled over top. How articulate. Mmmmmm. What did you get? I've got some pan-fried dumplings. They are very similar to the Korean gun mandu we often had when we were living as teachers in Korea. Let's see if these are as good. They look hot. They're pretty good. Someone found his favorites here. What started as just a little snack out here at the market has turned out to be a full on feast. I've got dim sum and fried spring rolls. Looking good. I got this - German sausage. It is very good. Krap. In case, we didn't quite have enough to eat - a sweet little dessert treat. That is banana egg roti with lots of chocolate and condensed milk drizzled over top. I've now traveled to over forty countries and I've yet to experience street food that can compete with Korea. Known locally as Pojangmacha, you can tantalize your taste buds with spicy, savory, salty and sweet street snacks. Two of my personal favorites include tteokbokki and hotteok. The following is a guide to some of our favorite Korean street -- warning -- I hope you're not hunrgy while watching this. And we are going to show you the different kinds of food you can buy in this alley. So that looks pretty appetizing. What do you have there? It sure does. Well we found some food on a stick here. Different kind of battered food objects. So if you want to take a look. We've got what appears to be a rice cake, kind of a lobster roll and as we go down a bit lower sort of like a hotdog/sausage thingamajig. And this is our first little snack food of the day. It looks tasty. Let's try it. Okay, I'm going to have the rice one. Very classy! Mmmmmm. Nice. Alright, now you are up. What are you going to have? I'm going to take a bite of the hotdog. Scarf it. Mmmmm. It's nice and spicy. Is it? This is really good. Yeah. You'll have to try this one. 호떡? 얼마 죠? 1000 원입니다. Okay, so we have got a delicious treat here called Hotteok. And it's a fried kind of sweet treat. Inside it's filled with cinnamon, honey and sugary kind of goodness. You bit into it and it's really warm. Perfect for the fall or winter. So I will take the first bite here. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's good. Mmmmmmm....haha So we've found ourselves a nice little back-alley to enjoy it. We're going to feast on the hotteok. It's delicious. Show us how it is done. It's hot. It's hot! Oh nice! The gooey-ness. It's made of honey. Malt. M A L T. Actually honey is liquid right? We boil this for one week. We make it solid because I have to show you a performance. It's hard. This is corn flour. Make a hole. Like this. Like this. Stretch. Stretch. Little by little. I have a clump of candy in my cheek. Nice. We just bought some sticky rice taffy and it is all natural. It is very sweet. It is kind of like a chewy candy. This would appear to be ice cream in some kind of cane. Look at what we've got here. Nice. Big enough? Go take a bite of that. Take a look at this. I think it is big enough to share. Well, good. Is that the biggest ice cream you've ever had? Yeah, that is really good. If you're looking to try Korean street food Insadong is one of your best bets in the entire country let alone Seoul. Speaking Korean. When traveling to Korea don't be afraid to sample as many Korean street food snacks as you possibly can -- your taste buds will surely be rewarded. Today we're on a quest for Macanese food. We love to eat and we're always excited to try new things. Background music playing. So this little treat over here is called and it is a popular Portuguese pastry made with eggs. And I'm going to have my first bite. It's kind of Macanese food egg tart. Chinese and Portuguese inspired. How is it? It's nice and sweet and the egg is really fluffy. Almost like a souffle. What do got there? A piece of meat. Is it good? It's like bacon. So time for our second treat of the day. And we found a quiet little back alley away from some of the busy main pedestrian areas. And we've got some almond cakes here. These are also a Macanese specialty. Oh yeah, those are real good. They remind me of Christmas shortbread cookies that you have for the winter holidays. That sounds tasty. Melt in the mouth. Let's look at those again. Yum. Background music playing. So we're here at a local eatery just down a backstreet in Macau and we're here to try a pork chop bun and we've also been given a black soy milk drink, so we'll see what that is all about. Okay, first I'm trying soy milk in my whole life. Mmmm is it sweet? This is sweet, yeah. Does it have a kind of a rich flavor? I don't know. You try it. Yeah, it definitely tastes like sweetened soy milk. A little bit similar to almond milk as well. I can also taste the black bean a little bit too. Background music playing. Time to try this famous pork chop bun here in Macau. Mmmmmm. That's really nice. Is it? It's a soft warm bun fresh out of the oven. I think it may have some butter. And the pork is just so flavorful. Save some for me. No. So it's starting to get really hot outside so we treated ourselves to a nice little pearl tea. Um, I think the origins of this are actually Taiwanese but it's really popular here in Macau, so we're adding it to the video. Background music playing. Tonight is our very last night in Yangshuo - a charming little town - in Southwestern China. We're going to show you around the main strip. Our first stop is going to be the street food market. I haven't eaten in like in maybe two hours. You're officially starving at this point. Starving. Ravenous. What are you going to have? Some meat. Oooh la lah. On a stick? Alright, happy boy with his meat. Let's see how this tastes. Is it hot? It's very tender and very smokey. It's well seasoned. It is good stuff. I noticed that she put lots of spices while she was cooking this for us. It is really spicy. I'm just tasting that now. Oh, it's hot. That's got some nice kick to it. Another favorite of yours. What are you having this time? We're getting the ever popular backpacker meal - the banana pancake. This time Chinese style. Alright, big bite. Piping hot. I can barely hold this. This is a different style. They actually smooshed the banana and put it right in the middle. As opposed to cutting it into little slices. Is it tasty? Yeah, it is good. Okay, so what are you eating right now? Well, nothing better to do at the night market - the Jonker street night market - than to indulge in street food. We've got a refreshing little dish right down here. Take a look at it. Different kinds of jellies, beans and shaved ice with sweet coconut milk and a bit of cane syrup. Oh, is it ever good. A perfect way to beat the heat. Okay, so right here we've ordered something that is called carrot cake. I am not seeing any carrot so far but it looks really tasty. Let's see what this is. It smells good. Is it good? How would you describe it? I would say it is like a Pad Thai without the noodles. You have the bean sprouts, you have a little bit of tofu, some egg, some peanuts. Awesome. I don't know where the carrot name comes from. I just bought some sugarcane juice. It is really sweet and refreshing. I love that they gave us lots of ice. It's perfect. Perfect for a hot night like this. Hawker Centres, which are open air food stall complexes, serve up a variety of inexpensive food. From Chinese to Indian and Malaysian to Indonesian there is a diverse selection of cuisine to choose from. We're having our first lunch here in Singapore at a Hawker Center and I've ordered myself some Chinese food. I have some Hainanese chicken rice, which looks absolutely delicious and I've got a butter chicken with butter naan right down here. Here is my dish - it is just a bit of plain rice and some chicken with crispy skin on the outside. Despite it looking a bit bland it is actually quite tasty. It is hard not to enjoy butter chicken - this is awesome. We've got a few more snacks to complete the meal. What are they? This is a combination of satay and dim sum, so we have sweet potato here and this one is yam. We've got tofu cubes over here. This one is prawn and I believe that is a shrimp dumpling. I'm going for something a little sweet here. I have some kind of yam spring roll. Should I dip it in peanut sauce? Nah, just have it. Is it sweet? It is. It tastes like sweet potato except that it is white. This crab didn't go on a skewer and it will taste good in the peanut sauce I'm pretty sure. We'll mix that bad boy around. What is happening over there? Kind of chewy? Here is the crab! Nice claw. Oh, that is delicious. It is so juicy inside. As budget travelers these Hawker centres in Singapore are a real find. Because it is really expensive in Singapore - it is one of the most expensive cities in all of Asia - certainly in Southeast Asia. You can find dishes here for between four to ten Singaporean dollars and it is so much cheaper than eating in a restaurant. I like the variety that you can find at the Hawker centers. For example, today we had some Indian food, Chinese food and we also saw stands selling Malaysian food, Singaporean dishes and lots of other things. This Hawker center is by the Singapore Flyer but you can find them all throughout the city. Okay, brave man going to eat a little a cricket there. Time to have a cricket. This is my first time eating one. Cheers. Okay, big bite. Stick it in your mouth. You try one as well? Oh no. It's actually really good. Wow. It's salty and a little bit sweet. Oh yeah, that's good stuff. Eat another one. One more. There we go. You liked it? This special one that we're getting outside has a scoop of ice cream in it. Even more delicious. Okay, what is this little treat? This little tasty treat here we picked up in a bag. Five pieces of deep-fried banana costing only 2 Ringgit which is like sixty to seventy-five cents. Is it sweet? It is just as good indoors as it is outdoors. Background music playing. So tonight we are at the food market right by Chiang Mai Gate. We actually came here looking for dumpling noodle soup but our favorite vendor is not here, so instead we are having dessert. Nothing quite like banana egg roti with chocolate sauce and we're going to show you how it is ordered and made. One, please. Background music playing. Speaking in Thai. Pounding noises. Sizzling sounds. Your face like Arabic. Pharaoh huh? Look like Pharaoh. Arabic. Do you eat now? Yes. Thank you. Chopping noises. Chocolate. Okay. Kop Kun Krap. Thank you. So this kind of banana pancake is popular all over SE Asia but this form being roti is quite different from the one we tried - especially in Malaysia. It's more thick. It's fluffier. It's got a lot of banana stuffed inside and it is just loaded with chocolate sauce and condensed milk. Background music playing. Ooh la la. Ready for the first bite. So good, so good that she is speechless. You can really taste the banana and the roti is very moist and wet with the chocolate sauce and the condensed milk. It's just really tasty and probably not the best thing to be eating since we're on a health kick but we need a little cheat every once in a while. Yeah, that's real good. The chocolate sauce is awesome. Even better though is nutella. If you can find a place making it with nutella that's pure bliss. So this delicious little dessert / snack was only 30 Baht which is one dollar. Background music playing. Background music playing. So we just came back to Chiang Mai after a Visa run in Penang, Malaysia and also a short little holiday in Phuket. Are we ever glad to be back. One of the main things that we missed about Chiang Mai was the street food that we get really close to our apartment. Today we're having one of our favorite meals. Background music playing. So let me give you a very special tour of my bowl. Ooh la la. So we have the yellow egg noodles. They look very nice. It also comes with some dumplings. Today it is pork. We also have slices of pork over here. Some bean sprouts and lots of greens, which add a lot of flavor to the soup. One of the things I love about this particular night stall stand is that we can add our own different spices exactly what we want. There is lots of chilly. That's what I'll be putting in mine. So I'm hardly putting any because this is super potent and I always end up making it way too spicy and then I can't finish my dish. Let's hope that is not too much this time. Noodles. I did make it too spicy again. Background music playing. So my favorite part about this dish is the wanton like dumplings. They are absolutely delicious and we're having pork dumplings today. Tasty? Oh, yeah. So you've seen us film a few other food videos at Chiang Mai gate, but the reason we keep coming back to this place is because there is so much variety. There are so many local foods that we can try, so we're constantly being introduced to new Thai meals. This is our favorite dining spot. Outdoors by the gate. Nice and cheap too. Samuel Jeffery, keeping it classy. You dripped! So the total for each meal is 35 Baht, which is just over a dollar.

Since we're hanging out in Germany these days we thought we would show you what a German breakfast looks like. We've setup the table and as you can see it consists of a lot of different breads - like we have a few buns here - and also meats. Germans like to have salami, ham and just different deli cuts for breakfast. We also have a few different cheeses, smoked salmon and - of course- you can't forget Muesli. It has been a very nice change in diet since we left Asia. Yeah, I'd say. It is quite the feast I must say as well. This is a completely different type of meal from what we were having in Asia. Most of the time in Asia we would have meals and breakfasts consisting of rice, noodle dishes and sometimes dim sum. This is a much heartier type of meal. One of the big changes since leaving Asia is that we're actually eating all of our breakfasts at home at the kitchen table. Whereas in Asia we were often going to a little market or like little street stalls where they prepare the food in front of us. In a way it is kind of nice just rolling out of bed in your pajamas and being able to eat at home without having to get dressed. With your bed hair and everything. Anyways, enough talking. It is time to dig in. Yes. That concludes breakfast. We certainly took care of things and now we just have empty plates in front of us. And a whole lot of dish washing to do. Sausage man! My new best friend. You can't come to Berlin and not have currywurst. Actually, yesterday was the very first time I tried it and I instantly loved it. Today we're going to be trying two different kinds of curry wurst. We're going to be trying some from the East side and also some from the West side and they're completely different. The currywurst is considered fast food here in Germany. It is a sausage that is steamed and then fried. It is sliced up and served with ketchup and curry powder over top. It is delicious! First bite! It's amazing. I've been eating these since I first got to Berlin and I haven't gotten sick of them. They are so tasty. I'm going to make sure I've got lots of curry sauce on mine. Oh, wow! I can see why these are very popular in Germany. And if just eating currywurst isn't enough for you one of the more quirky attractions in Berlin is visiting the currywurst museum where of our course apparently you get to have currywurst at the end of your tour. So the sausage can be eaten many different ways. Today I've got it with french fries but you can order it with in a bun with a side our sauerkraut or even with a baked potato so you're not limited for options. You can typically pick up the currywurst for anywhere between 2.50 to 3 Euro just on its own and if you want to get a side like fries it usually is about 5 Euros. If Currywurst is to your liking, you'll want to check out this quirky museum devoted to Berlin's favorite sausage. One of the coolest things about this museum is that they have a giant sofa shaped like a Currywurst. For today's video you are in for a sweet treat - quite literally - because we are in Germany and we've decided to taste test a few of our favorite chocolates. Chocolate. The brand we are testing is Ritter Sport. We have six different varieties - let's show them. So you've got three in your hand and I've got three in mine. We're going to be trying all of these and letting you know what our favorites are. Now the first thing to know is that there is a special way to open these. Audrey is going to show us. I'm a pro - watch this! Okay, that one malfunctioned. One more. You just crack it open and ooh la la - chocolate! Okay, the first kind we're going to be trying is this yellow pack and it is a corn flake chocolate. It is regular milk chocolate but stuffed with cornflakes. I've never had chocolate with corn flakes but I like both things, so I have high expectations here. I've had this before and it is one of my favorites. So a bite each. Oh, wow, that is a crunchy one. How do you like it? It's amazing. It reminds me of a chocolate we have in North America - I think it is called Crunch or Crunchy. It is like the Crunchy bar but this is better. The next one we're trying is the red package - this is Marzipan. It is basically an almond paste made with honey and sugar. That is the filling inside of this chocolate. It also looks like it is a darker chocolate. I'm not a fan of dark chocolate because I prefer milk chocolate. We'll see how this goes. Here. That is very rich and decadent. Do you like it? I prefer milk chocolate. I've already said that. It's not my favorite but the Marzipan is very sweet so it kind of balances the bitterness of the dark chocolate, so it is okay. Oh, I need water! Okay, now this is the one I've been really wanting to have. I'm a huge fan of peppermint chocolate and Ritter Sport is high quality chocolate so I have very high expectations for this. Okay. Let's give it a try. Oh, wow! What do you think? It's a lot like those After Eight really thin chocolate strips - that is what it reminds me of. Yeah, that is really good. It is also like the Junior Mints that we have in North America as well. Number four. This one is the Espresso flavor. Do you normally like espresso? I do not like coffee, so no espresso for me. Yeah, we're not coffee drinkers so I'm not sure how we're going to like these ones. This is torture. Okay, it has a strong coffee flavor but it is milk chocolate and not dark chocolate so it is bearable. I think if you put enough sugar in anything you can make it taste good. Even though I don't like this flavor normally, I actually quite like it in chocolate form. Next up we have a new flavor that I haven't seen before. It is called Olympia. It has Yogurt, honey, nuts and grape sugar if my translation is correct. That sounds interesting. Let's see. Take a square. Cough. Ewwww! Oh, it's an interesting one. Do you like it? It doesn't have a very distinct flavor considering it has four unique ingredients in the filling. Yeah, I agree with that. I just coughed on the chocolate so that I get the rest of it afterwards. Not a bad strategy. Last but certainly not least we have coconut. I'm a huge coconut fan. Do you think you're going to like this one? I've actually been having this chocolate when Sam is not around. I go into the supermarket and get a square for myself and gobble it up. I'm just finding this out now. That is evil. Here you go. That is the best one in my opinion. This looks so good that I'm taking two squares. Oh, wow! It's like big chunks of coconut. It's creamy, it's sweet. I feel like I'm back in the tropics enjoying a coconut shake. That is by far the best one as far as I'm concerned. I'm going to choose my top two and if I had to rank them I'd say coconut is number one and maybe the cornflakes number two. I really enjoyed those. What about you? Well, for me I would go coconut also number one but then I would go peppermint number two. I think we've figured out some quite important here. If we were to buy the coconut flavor Ritter Sport we're going to be fighting over it. Quite literally. Hey, give it to me. If any of you chocolate lovers find yourselves in Germany there is actually a Ritter Sport chocolate factory located outside of Stuttgart. I went there a couple of years ago and there chocolate store is amazing. They have so much variety and all of the packaging is so colorful so you can certainly spend a few hours there picking up souvenirs to take back home or to eat before you go back home. If you're in Germany traveling and you want to try the Ritter Sport they are 99 cents of a Euro. A little history into this chocolate bar - as you can see it is square shape because it was actually meant to fit inside of a gentleman's blazer inside the front pocket. If they were ever at the theater - or the cinema - and they needed something to munch on they could discretely pull it out and have their Ritter Sport. Yum. That's clever. I just need to spit it out. You didn't like that? Oh gosh Audrey don't be so dramatic. The longer I keep it in my mouth the worse it gets. Jeez. Stop being weird. Coconut, my turn. Me. I've only talked twice. Do you want to do it? Are you sure? Of course, you cannot come to Berlin and not eat a Wurst or a sausage. I've just ordered myself one from the street. They have lots of local stands and this was only one Euro and thirty five cents. Big bite! That is so good and I got it with mustard, which is even tastier.",False,20140604 - German Food ∩╝Ü An introduction to German Cuisine For First Time Visitors To Germany.en.srt

It is our first time in the Middle East and we're super excited. And to start things off we're going to be doing a food tour around Jaffa. Where we're just going to try lots of traditional Israeli dishes. Now Sam and I aren't very familiar with Israeli food. Like we know Hummus and Shakshouka. And baklava. So we're excited to try some new dishes and see what we like and see what we don't like. So enjoy! Jews and Muslims argue over the best hummus. He's Muslim. I think he's making a great hummus. But don't quote me. Don't quote me. How to buy hummus. So I'm going to do. I'm going to be lucky. I'm going to do the first one. Okay. So there is a few methods. We can argue on that. But basically that's what I do. Don't kill me in here. I do this. You basically do this. You just. Sorry, I'm not going to be very methodical. Mmmmm, that's good. That's how I eat it as well. It's so tasty. Happy dance at the end. So hummus taste test. I love hummus. I'm know I'm going to like this. Do you like spicy food? Big massive amounts of it. How is that? Hummus in Israel? We believe in double dipping in Israel, okay? So much flavor. Wow! Wonderful:) And you're allowed to double dip I just heard. Even better! I'm going to grab a big chunk. Some chickpeas in there. No holding back. MMMM, yeah. Isn't that good? Isn't that amazing? It's really creamy and smooth. I'm going to double dip. Breaking bread. So what are you going to be trying? We're trying Shakshouka next. It's a mixture of tomatoes, peppers and some egg. So let's have a taste. I'm not entirely sure how to do this. Just dip it! Grab some. There you go. This is hot. I'm going to burn myself. Mmmmm, how is it? That's some tomatoe-ey goodness! That's really nice. Okay, say couscous taste test. Lots of vegetables. It's really good and light. Also very flavorful as well. Background music playing. Looks like a pastry stuffed with cheese and some sesame seeds on top. It's super hot. Owe! You can kind of see the cheese there. Mmmmm. Oh yeah, you can. I really like the cheese. Is it salty? It is salty. I don't know if it is feta or what. Cottage cheese? Either way it's really good. Alright, so I am trying something called malabi. It's a dessert. It's sweet like a pudding but it's consistency is a bit like jello. really delicious. Really really sweet. It has a syrup and sugar on top. Yeah, it's really really sweet. With shredded coconut. Really? More dessert? This is so good. So you are having? kanafeh. It's warm. like a pudding. With sugary hairs on the outside. I don't even know how to describe it. It's just really nice. So the food tour was amazing. We got to try so many different kinds of foods. We were actually full early on but the food was just so good that we kept eating, eating and eating. And I got introduced to some new kinds of desserts that I had never tried before they were really sweet and really delicious. For lunch today we're having a Druze meal and I'm standing right beside an olive tree. Ooh, with little olives. You can see them. Background music playing. And she's preparing kebabs. There is cabbage, there is stuffed lime beans. Background music playing. We're going to have a feast of a buffet about to take place, so come let me show you all the good food. Background music playing. So the food is amazing. I think my favorite so far is this chicken. Which is stuffed with rice and lots of spices. This is such an amazing feast. Everything I've tried so far has been good. Background music playing. That was the feast of all feasts. I am super stuffed. I promised myself I was only going to have one plate but I ended up going back for seconds and then also dessert. So today we are at Dan Gourmet here in Tel Aviv. We are going to be taking a cooking class and it is starting. We add some sugar and this is the mixing method. Everything goes together. Background music playing. I've got my apron on and I'm ready to cook. So what are you doing now? I've been put in charge of flipping eggplants. Background music playing. Sizzling sound. Background music playing. Sizzling noises. Background music playing. So we're trying some tahini now. And apparently we're going to be using that for the meat. It's really tangy. Background music playing. Some nice tahini. This is our version of pizza. Background music playing. You're struggling Sam. What's happening right now. I'm the worst cook in the kitchen. You need some flour. Background music playing. Here I've got Lahmacun. Hopefully I pronounced it properly. It's got lamb and tahini. Oh, it's going to be good. It's like Israeli pizza. Hahaha. Delicious. Lahmacun. This one is a little toasted. We forgot it in the oven. So, extra crispy. Mmmmm. That's really good. Can you taste the tahini? You can really taste the lamb. That's my favorite part. The lamb meat. Mmmmmm. Background music playing. So we have our charred eggplant with tahini ready to be devoured. So it's picnic time. What are you carrying? This is just for me. Just kidding. What is everyone else eating? What is everyone else having? So here is the fruit of our labors. We've got a nice little picnic feast. Let's check that out. Oooh! And a beautiful patio setting. Background music playing. So that concludes our cooking class at Dan Gourmet. We've been here for two and a half hours just cooking and eating and trying everything we've made so we are stuffed and hopefully we'll get to try some of these recipes eventually once we have a kitchen of our own. Background music playing. So this evening we're doing a pretty exciting project. We're here at Haifa University and the students from two universities in the region have come together and we have been working to cook some food from the region. Some Israeli food. So this is kind of like a pop up kitchen. We're cooking outdoors and we've got all range and levels of cooks. From lowest - me. From people who are almost like master chefs in their own home. It's been fun. It has been. Background music. So we made a karobee, carrot, fresh mint, walnut and fresh parley salad. We put a little of fig, honey glaze on it and some fresh lemon juice. And salt and pepper and we have a masterpiece. And the matchsticks were cut by this young man named Nomadic Samuel. He just happened to come in and land right here in Haifa and he's cooking with us, so now he's going to go from being a travel blogger to a food blogger. Now that he can make matchstick carrots he thinks he's Gordon Ramsay. What have we got over here? This is our anti-pasta. And I've got my hands. I need to put lemon here. So you're squeezing lemon on top of it. On top of the eggplant and garlic. That smells good. Background music playing. Looks like pears with brown sugar and cinnamon. This is the crumble. Is it like an apple crumble? It's a pear crumble. It's like apple crumble but with pears. Background music playing. So the fruits of your labor. I actually helped make this if you can believe it. All of this fine chopping. Mmmmmm. So can you give us a tour of your plate? Compliments of Ally from Ally's Kitchen. She taught me how to chop today. hahaha. A tour of my plate. So we are having eggplant over her. Tabouleh and this was made with cauliflower. We have our stew with potatoes and chicken, carrots. And this lovely salad with walnuts and carrots that Sam helped make. And which one did you help make? I made the stew. Background music playing. My name is Elad. I'm a Krembo expert. This is Israeli sweet. Now as I was saying. There are two types of people in this world. The first type that actually eats the Krembo from the top and second one which I don't understand why for some reason start from down on the bottom. There is a biscuit down at the bottom. Just open up your mouth okay and you choose either to hold just like that or just like that. Since I belong to the first group. I'm a topper. Exactly. I'm a topper. I'm going to start from the top. I'm going to open up my mouth. My swallowing hole and just like that and I'm going to give it a bite. The whole thing? No. Audrey is next. Audrey. Audrey. So now the bottom is ruined thank you Ally. What am I supposed to do? Please. Oh my gosh. That was a good bite Audrey. You've got a nice mastication. Hahahaha! Your turn. Yeah. Oh yeah! I can devour that. Come on Kevin! Kevin! Kevin! Yeah! Oh, Kevin perfect. I think that's a glamour shot. We need a glamour shot. Of the bite marks! hahaha! Then you take the top of your finger. Finger nail actually. And you place it on to the surface. Stiff surface. Then you go through the paper in strips. Okay. Straighten it. Straighten it. This is what we used to do with Wrigley spearmint wrappers. Gum wrappers. Cool! And it gives you joy? Like bubble wrap. Take a look at how beautiful and neat that is. What do you have there? Yeah, it's a goblet on fire. No, just kidding. It's a wine glass.",False,20140603 - Israeli Cuisine and Arabic Street Food in Israel∩╝Ü Israeli Food Tour Compilation Guide.en.srt

There are lots of different vantage points around the park so that you can get your shot with the Petronas Towers and this is one of them. The Petronas towers took six years to build and they were the tallest building in Asia until Taipei 101 took them over. I've been to Tapei 101 and these are more impressive. These towers were designed by an Argentinean architect names Caesar Pelli - represent! Represent because why? Oh because I grew up in Argentina. There you go. The double decker sky bridge here connects to the two towers together. It is quite awesome. My question is this a water fountain or can I actually go swimming in there. We are in Malacca right now and it is nighttime so we are about to head over to Jonker Street where they have one of the biggest night markets I have ever seen. It is a great place to find food and go shopping, so let's head over there. What are you eating right now? There is nothing better to do at the night market, the Jonker street night market, than to indulge in street food. We've got a refreshing little dish right down here - take a look at it. There are different kinds of jellies and beans and shaved ice with some sweet coconut milk and cane syrup. Is it ever good! It is the perfect way to beat the heat. Right here we've ordered something called a carrot cake. I am not seeing any carrots so far but it looks really tasty. It smells good. Is it good? How would you describe it? I would say it is like a Pad Thai without the noodles. You have the bean sprouts, you have a little bit of tofu and some egg and peanuts. I don't know where the carrot name comes from. I just bought some sugarcane juice - it is really sweet and refreshing and I love that they gave us lots of ice. It is perfect. It is perfect for a hot night like this. It is bright and early. It is only seven twenty in the morning and I've been dragged out of bed by someone to go visit the Batu Caves early in the day. How are we getting there? We are taking the commuter train from KL Sentral. One Ringgit each. It was cheap! Today we are visiting the Batu Caves. It is only 13 kilometers north of Kuala Lumpur and this is an important Hindu shrine. The caves takes its name from the Batu River and is dedicated to Lord Murugan. It looks like it is feeding time for the pigeons over here. Who said money or food couldn't buy you friends. Here I am on step number one. I've only got two hundred and seventy two more of these bad boys to climb. There are lots of macaques or little monkeys. This is my first time seeing monkeys up close so it is all that I'm taking pictures of at the temple. Finally two hundred and seventy two steps later we have made it to the top. This is actually my third time coming to the Batu Caves but this is by far the earliest I've come and what a difference it makes. There is hardly anyone here and it feels like we have the place to ourselves. We've had intimate encounters with pigeons, monkeys, roosters and there is a performance going on. My tip to anyone is to come early. We beat the first tourist bus here. Look at them coming. Hahaha! Now we are rewarding ourselves with a vegetarian Indian feast. I swear I must have lost half of my water (body weight) going up and down those Batu Caves. I ordered myself a delicious roti which I'm going to enjoy right now. I am starving. Masala Chai! I'm going to start off by saying that I was tricked into coming here. I was told it was going to be a short - oh, it is a ten minute walk from Chinatown as we're right around the corner - and we've been walking for forty-five minutes in circles and uphill. I am covered in sweat and a bird just flew by me. We're at KL Bird Park - the largest walk in aviary - in the world. That means the birds can fly from freely around the park. This aviary is home to over three thousand birds in more than two hundred species. So far we have seen love birds, flamingos, peacocks and birds that we don't even know what they are. This over here is the feeding area. As you can see the birds get a really nice diet of papayas and bananas. This feels like Jurassic Park with the birds instead of dinosaurs. I'm going to choose two birds and then pose with them. This is the selection you've got. Are you having fun? We can feed Lorries for like two Ringgit, which is about seventy cents, so why not. Sam, tell us about your new friends here. I've got four little friends and we're having a feeding party right now. Hello. Overall, this was a really fun experience although it is not the cheapest thing to do in KL. It is something we both highly recommend. Wear bug spray! Yes. Cat cafes seem like a novelty to most but certainly not for us. Visiting Purrfect Cat Cafe in Georgetown - Penang, Malaysia - marked our third cat cafe outing in Asia. Previously we had visited one in Seoul, South Korea and another one in Bangkok, Thailand. The format for this recently opened cat cafe is similar to the two others we visited. For the opportunity to spend time with cats you have to purchase 18 Ringgit (the equivalent of six dollars) worth of snacks, desserts and/or drinks. You can freely pet and play with the cats but picking them up or entering their sleep zone is not permitted. This particular cat cafe had its strong and weak points. A smaller and more intimate space was certainly a bonus; however, there were less cats to play with and many of them were sleeping in the no people zone. Overall, we'd recommend the Purrfect Cat Cafe as a fun afternoon outing to escape the stifling heat and humidity of typical day in George Town. For breakfast this morning we're having one of my all-time favorite foods - dim sum - and there are so many restaurants to choose from here in George Town but I'm going to my favorite. Let's go. There is a recurring theme in most of our morning videos and that is I'm usually not awake and that I'm being dragged out of bed to go do something. This morning it is Chinese breakfast again. What do we got? I believe those are shrimp dumplings. Could I have a cup of tea darling? You may and this is very hot. Burning yourself for love. No dim sum meal is complete without a cup of tea. Sam and his buns. Barbecue pork bun and red bean paste bun. One of the most fascinating aspects of eating at this dim sum restaurant is just how you order the food. All of the different ladies come by pushing these different kinds of carts some of them filled with dim sum and some of them are filled with pao. There are different kinds of buns. They have pork and all kinds of things. You just pick them and they put them right on the table. They have this little bill here and they check them off with the prices. You can see our bill right now and how it is shaping up. I'm sure we'll be ordering more. Which one did you try just now? I got a shrimp and veggie one and it is so tasty. Have a look? One of my absolute favorites is the barbecue pork bun. It just has so much flavor and it is 'wow' delicious. We've been trying lots of different dim sum. I find that the fillings are varied. You can get vegetables, pork and there are some with shrimp and then you have all of the sweet dim sum, which have a red bean paste. Those are the ones I like the most. The ones that I'm not a huge fan of. Again, lots of different variety. One of my favorite things about having dim sum is the social aspect. It is the kind of meal that you come and enjoy with friends over a cup of tea. I'm so full yet I keep eating more. Sam is certainly in his element over here. Being back in UNESCO Heritage city Malacca, Malaysia on our one year travel anniversary was the perfect chance for us to eat Thali, an Indian meal made up of various dishes typically including rice, dal, vegetables, roti, papad, chutney and pickle. It is lunchtime here in Melaka and today we're eating at the Selvam Banana Leaf restaurant, which is an Indian restaurant. We've been here several times during the week. It is one of our favorite places so far. It is really popular with locals, so we're going to show you what a Thali set meal looks like. When I was backpacking in India three and a half years ago I subsisted off of Thali, so I'm thrilled to be having the opportunity to eat it again here in Malacca, Malaysia. Thali is an Indian meal that consists of various kinds of dishes. It can be served on a platter or - in this case- we're having it on a banana leaf if you take a look at it down here. It comes with different vegetables, curries and rice. Typically you would eat this using your hand; however, someone has to hold the camera, so I'm going to be using cutlery and Sam will demonstrate how it is done the proper way. Alright boy, dig in. Get them fingers dirty. You mix it around here. There we go. That's awesome stuff. Sam and I ordered two different Thali sets. He is having the vegetarian one and I am having the chicken but the only difference is that I get a little plate with a chicken curry on the side. Everything else we got was the same. We have the same dhal, the same rice and the same chips. Take a bite of that chicken to see how it tastes. I already have a chunk here. It is very tender and you can tell it has been cooked slowly for a long time. It is really good. Is it spicy? Of course, a bit of Indian spice in there. One thing I absolutely love about Thali is the concept of the bottomless refills. You eat until you're fully satisfied. That means if you go through your rice - and you finished your rice and you want more - you call them over and they load you up. It is perfect for a hungry boy. Our Thali lunch came to 22 Ringgit which is roughly $7 USD and that included three drinks, two different Thali sets (including a chicken and a vegetarian) and a roti pisang banana flat bread for dessert. Today we are here visiting Kek Lok Si temple and this is the biggest Buddhist temple in all of Southeast Asia. In order for us to get here we had to go through a bit of a market. I've never seen so many turtles in one place. Today we are visiting the Temple of Supreme Bliss and I'm feeling particularly blissful this morning. Let's have a look. This impressive temple took nearly twenty years to build and was funded almost entirely by donations. Even today they're doing more renovations. This temple is located on a hilltop in Air Itam and it offers excellent views of the city below. How sweaty are you? I have rivers flowing down my body. Your shirt seems quite appropriate now. I am hot. I'm hot! These temples here combine Mahayana Buddhism and Chinese rituals. That concludes our tour of the temples here. For anyone who would like to come you can take the bus 201, 203 and 204 from the Komplex Komptar - basically the main mall from George Town and it is about a 40 minute ride to here. Overall, the temples are pretty cool. It is very much commercial but I guess that is to be expected. But enough about the temples now it is time for lunch. The Petronas Towers are brilliant by day but 'wow' do they ever shine bright at night. This is now our third time coming to the Petronas Towers and having seen it during the day and at night I have to say I prefer it at night a lot more. They have really cool light shows that take place. There is also a lot more people who come to watch the show. There you have it - the Petronas Towers at night - a sight to behold! Today we are having dinner at a great little restaurant that is located right across from the Puduraya bus terminal in Kuala Lumpur and it is Indian food. My favorite! Nothing like refreshing fruit drinks to start your meal. Here is our food. Nice! Thank you! Delicious. What we are having today is called Roti Canai and it is an Indian flat bread. I've got one that has cheese inside and I'm going to dip it in the curry sauce. The roti canai is the Malaysian form of flat bread. Oh yeah! What we're having here is roti canai. Roti means bread in Hindi and Malay. Canai in Malay means to roll out the dough. How do you roll it out? Show us. Nice. It is made with egg flour and water and in special cases where there is special ingredients like this one here - cheese! Sam is feeling a little shy because there is people watching him eat right now. Is it the freckles? Is it the t-shirt? Is it because he is using his hands? It's s spectacle. What could it be? There are two ways to eat roti canai - by hand or by utensil - and believe me I will not give up an opportunity to use my hands. Demonstrate for us. Mix it up really good. That's sloppy! You just wiped it on your pants! No, I didn't. Audrey here will be having it using utensils. I on the other hand am eating like a lady using a fork and spoon. Keeping it classy. So roti canai is thinner than the Indian style Naan bread which a lot of people are more familiar with. It is thin in the same way as chapati for example. You can get plain roti or you get a little fancier with your order and they have banana roti, garlic roti, cheese roti and egg roti. Yes, I had that earlier. Lots to choose from! One of the coolest things when we come here to the restaurant is the little order you get. You just keep tallying it up here on the side and eventually when you're finished feasting they finally give you a total. This is a meal that you can have for breakfast, lunch or dinner. We're having it for dinner right now and I'm pretty sure I'll be coming back for breakfast. Get ready! We have our tickets in hand and tonight we are going to be doing the Melaka River Cruise. The city really lights up at night. I'm really enjoying this right now because I've actually only walked along this area. I've never taken the boat and I've never done this at night so this is awesome. It is so much easier and convenient taking the boat than walking. My favorite part of the tour has been getting to see all of the art on the exterior of the buildings by the river. Since I first came here back in 2008 there has been a lot of development in the area. There used to be a lot of traditional homes alongside the Kampong the river but not anymore. Now there are boutique hotels and condos. It has lost a little bit of its charm in my opinion.| Today we are visiting a place that is an important part of George Town's heritage - the Clan Jetties. These are the last bastions of old Chinese settlements. One of the things that has surprised me most about visiting the Clan Jetties is that people live here with their pets, so even though their houses are on stilts above the water they still keep dogs, cats and it works. Here we've found some friendly little doggies. Yes. Leave it to me to find puppies. Cats. Hello, cat. It is purring. Cat, let's steal you. You can fit in my backpack. Well, we've encountered a lot of friendly cats and dogs but not this one. All of the houses in this area are built on stilts over the water and they even have a temple. Here is the temple of stilts that we were looking to find. This area is now part of the heritage trail and it was established roughly 150 years ago. There are several distinct Jetty's along this area. In fact, there were seven at one time. One just burnt down and now we are visiting the Chew Jetty, which is welcoming us. How are we feeling? I'm feeling good. I'm just resting on someone's porch I imagine. This stilt villages actually remind me quite a bit of the ones I visited while in Brunei, which are called the Kampong Ayer. Those were even quite a bit bigger. These are still very fascinating. In the back of one of these jetties there is the most random Santa Clause. In the back. Hello! Today we are visiting the Botanical Gardens just outside of George Town. If you look up over there you can see some monkeys. Actually there is another one there. That one is easier to spot. That looks like a bearded one. Hi monkey. So Sam let's talk about travel mistakes. How did we mess up today? Well guess what - I hardly brought any money today and as we were taking the bus to come over to the Botanical Gardens I just figured that out and I'm like 'oh no' we're totally not going to be able to get in but luckily it is free! That is good because I didn't have any money on me either. I never carry around cash. Well, thank you for that. We woke up kind of late this morning and we were worried that it was going to be too hot by the time we got here but fortunately this place is so shady and lush and it is so much fresher than it is in George Town - especially down the side trails. It is so much cooler. We've been on a quest for the main waterfall and just as soon as we thought we found it - it is just this humble little thing. Wow! Impressive! Amazing! This one is still not what I envisioned but I think it could be it. It looks a bit more grand. What do you think? Maybe, maybe. False alarm yet again. It is showing here that this is the way to the waterfall. Let's go find it. It is nap time for the big boy. Well, third time is a charm. We have found the actual waterfalls that were outlined in the park guide but not quite as we expected. A little trickle. A trickle falls. Voila! Want to jump in for a dip? Nah. It is lunchtime here in Malacca, so we're about to go to a Baba Nyonya type of restaurant, which is a mix of Chinese and Malaysian cuisine. This is a real hole in the wall kind of place. It is. I am going to be showing you the Nyonya Laksa, which is spicy curry with a mixture of Malay and Chinese elements. Let's take a look. It is a coconut based curry soup and it has curd puffs, fish sticks, shrimp and clams added to it. It is very flavorful. What I am having next is called Rojak, which is the Malay word for mixture. It is a refreshing salad. Yes. Take a look over here. It is made using fruits and vegetables, so it has pineapple, cucumbers, bean sprouts. It is just a really nice and refreshing salad on a hot day. Oh yeah. The last of our four dishes is called Popiah and it is a spring roll that has an outside like a crepe. I'll show you the ingredients here. It has a sweet bean and soy sauce and it often has turnips and bean sprouts, tofu, peanuts and kind of omelet like. It has got everything going on. Take a bite. Classy! To beat the heat we have some lime juice. Is that refreshing? What has been your favorite dish so far? I've actually like this one here - the Nyonya dumplings - as I've never had this one before. I've tried the others but this is my first time for this. Okay, take a big bite and tell us why you like it. Struggling! What I really like about it is the glutinous rice. It is a unique kind of coating for the dumpling. Also, it is quite sweet inside. It is hard for me not to like sweet foods when it comes to me and my taste buds. What is Miss Audrey's favorite? Well, I've really enjoyed the rice dumplings as well but I think my absolute favorite has been the salad over here. I haven't eaten fresh fruits and fresh vegetables for almost a year because in Korea they cost a fortune, so I'm in heaven right now. I'm just eating and feasting on this. What do you got now - pineapple? Yeah, this is a pineapple. It is a nice sweet treat and the coating on the salad is delicious as well. It is a sweet sauce with peanuts on top, so it is just perfect. One of the top things to do when you're visiting George Town is to take a rickshaw tour and that's exactly what we're going to do. This is our colorful little ride right here. Sorry, what's your name? Harry. Harry, nice to meet you. Bye. We're going on a rickshaw ride. Hindi music playing. Background music playing. We've got some mighty big waves coming here. Woah. So we got soaked by a massive wave. We sure did. And it is actually kind of refreshing now, so I'm kind of happy it happened and our camera survived it. Not too bad actually. Background music playing. A big cat and a little mouse. Isn't it cute. So this is a Chinese temple? Yeah. Very old temple. One hundred years old. Honking horn. So a tour around historic Georgetown will reveal some crumbling colonial architecture as Audrey likes to say. No, I don't. Background music playing. So over here is Saint George church. The British governor used the black car. Oh, that's the old governor's car. Where are you? So this is the old train that used to travel up Penang hill carrying passengers up. A bamboo ship. Kassim Mustafa, one of our favorite restaurants in George Town to get roti and it is noticeable for its bright green and yellow paint. Background music playing. And our final stop - our hotel. Background music playing. Penang is known for its distinct neighborhoods and none is more colorful than Little India. As you might expect there are also lots of Indian restaurants in Little India so it is the perfect place to get some Palak Paneer or curry or Naan bread, Lassis or anything! One of the things that you can find in Little India are lots of Saris stores and Bengal stores. Lots of shopping to be done.",False,20140601 - Things to do in Malaysia ∩╜£ Top Attractions Travel Guide To Malaysia.en.srt

So today we're visiting the Dead Sea here in Israel. This is a place where you can just float in the water and it's impossible to sink and before I go in there, I'm going to get all muddy. Because it is good for you. So the Dead Sea is four hundred meters below Sea level and it has such a high concentration of salt. I believe it's three of four times as much as normal. It allows you to float. This feels so gross. This is going to get under my nails. Time to get your mud on! You feeling the mud? MMMM. Background music playing. I think I did an okay job. I wasn't able to get my back but I think I'm ready to go in. The mud is almost dry. Background music playing. What are you all doing out there? We're floating Samuel! Yes, it's the Dead Sea! And we're alive! So after my little spa session of putting mud all over my face and then washing it off in the sea my skin feels super soft. Like a babies bottom. I still feel like Wolverine. So today is our first morning in Israel. It is our first time in the Middle East and we're super excited. And to start things off we're going to be doing a food tour around Jaffa. Where we're just going to try lots of traditional Israeli dishes. Now Sam and I aren't very familiar with Israeli food. Like we know Hummus and Shakshouka. And baklava. So we're excited to try some new dishes and see what we like and see what we don't like. So enjoy! Jews and Muslims argue over the best hummus. He's Muslim. I think he's making a great hummus. But don't quote me. Don't quote me. How to buy hummus. So I'm going to do. I'm going to be lucky. I'm going to do the first one. Okay. So there is a few methods. We can argue on that. But basically that's what I do. Don't kill me in here. I do this. You basically do this. You just. Sorry, I'm not going to be very methodical. Mmmmm, that's good. That's how I eat it as well. It's so tasty. Happy dance at the end. So hummus taste test. I love hummus. I'm know I'm going to like this. Do you like spicy food? Big massive amounts of it. How is that? Hummus in Israel? We believe in double dipping in Israel, okay? So much flavor. Wow! Wonderful:) And you're allowed to double dip I just heard. Even better! I'm going to grab a big chunk. Some chickpeas in there. No holding back. MMMM, yeah. Isn't that good? Isn't that amazing? It's really creamy and smooth. I'm going to double dip. Breaking bread. So what are you going to be trying? We're trying Shakshouka next. It's a mixture of tomatoes, peppers and some egg. So let's have a taste. I'm not entirely sure how to do this. Just dip it! Grab some. There you go. This is hot. I'm going to burn myself. Mmmmm, how is it? That's some tomatoe-ey goodness! That's really nice. Okay, say couscous taste test. Lots of vegetables. It's really good and light. Also very flavorful as well. Background music playing. Looks like a pastry stuffed with cheese and some sesame seeds on top. It's super hot. Owe! You can kind of see the cheese there. Mmmmm. Oh yeah, you can. I really like the cheese. Is it salty? It is salty. I don't know if it is feta or what. Cottage cheese? Either way it's really good. Alright, so I am trying something called malabi. It's a dessert. It's sweet like a pudding but it's consistency is a bit like jello. really delicious. Really really sweet. It has a syrup and sugar on top. Yeah, it's really really sweet. With shredded coconut. Really? More dessert? This is so good. So you are having? kanafeh. It's warm. like a pudding. With sugary hairs on the outside. I don't even know how to describe it. It's just really nice. So the food tour was amazing. We got to try so many different kinds of foods. We were actually full early on but the food was just so good that we kept eating, eating and eating. And I got introduced to some new kinds of desserts that I had never tried before they were really sweet and really delicious. Today we're going on a tour of West Bank or Palestine. We have a very diverse tour. We're going to be seeing historical attractions, political attractions and tourist attractions. Music playing in the background. Our first stop today is Sheppard's Field and here in the background we have the Church of the Sheppard which is where the three sheppard's are supposed to have seen the start of David in the sky before Jesus was born. Singing in the choir Music playing in the background. Children cheering and laughing! More music playing. Now we're visiting a refugee camp. It looks more like a city because it's been around for more than 60 years. Sizzling sound of frying oil. Music in the background. I've had falafel many times but this is the first time I've seen it prepared. Forget Starbucks, I'm going to Stars and Bucks. Music playing. So were are back at the Jordan River again. A few days ago we visited from the Jordanian side in Bethany beyond the Jordan. It's a bit surreal being back so soon. Music playing. Right now we're visiting Jericho and to the left is a new part of Jericho. The new city. And to my right is the world's oldest city. Background music. We're visiting the first West Bank Palestinian brewery here. Ah, that's good. 0:00:00.810,0:00:05.759 So we are now at Rosh HaNikra which is known as the window to the Mediterranean and we 0:00:05.759,0:00:10.630 have some amazing views of the water below. So the sun is setting and we're going to take 0:00:10.630,0:00:11.960 the cable car down. Music playing 0:00:11.960,0:00:12.550 Music playing Music playing 0:00:12.550,0:00:13.150 Music playing Music playing 0:00:13.150,0:00:20.150 So the rock formation behind me is known as the Elephant's leg. And the large rock is 0:00:24.029,0:00:31.029 supposed to be the elephant's body and little part you see resting at the end is the elephant's 0:01:18.439,0:01:18.520 leg. Music playing 0:01:18.520,0:01:18.619 Music playing Music playing 0:01:18.619,0:01:21.950 So there are these strange creatures living here between the border of Israel and Lebanon. 0:01:21.950,0:01:28.950 We have no idea what they are. They look like big fat ugly rats. Or giant hamsters. 0:01:29.340,0:01:36.340 Music playing Music playing 0:01:37.749,0:01:44.749 Monsters. It's like rat invasion. Rat invasion!!! Ooooh 0:01:54.569,0:02:01.569 Music playing Music playing Background music playing. Today we're going on a tour to Jaffa where we're going to be checking out a traditional flea market. Background music playing. I knew we'd find a cat. Crazy cat lady. Hello! Background music playing. Bat sounds. Background music playing. Man playing music. Background music playing. You can find lots of really cool items in this market. They have antiques, souvenirs, paintings, furniture. Background music. So we really enjoyed exploring Jaffa or Yaffo as they like to call it. So my favorite thing about wandering around Jaffa has been that they have these narrow little alleys that are just kind of like a maze and you come across these friendly little cats that are just hanging out, so it's been a really fun place to explore. It's also a nice sunny day and we're right by the sea, so it was a great morning out and a nice little introduction to Israel. Background music playing. So today we're visiting Masada and we just finished taking the cable car up to the very top of the fort and now we're going to go check it out. Background music playing. It sure is a scorcher outside today. Background music playing. So right now we're going to go visit an old water cistern. So we're going to take some steps and go underground. It's going to be kind of dark and tight. Let's go check it out. Background music playing. Singing! Background music playing. One, two, three FOOD!!! Wow, huh! So it actually answers back, no? Background music playing. This is an original Byzantine church. Oooh! Background music playing. So it's kind of symbolic to bring a Roman siege weapon to a place that was seized by Romans and I don't know if we can see it shoot off. Okay, here goes nothing. Hahaha! Backgrounds music playing. Music playing in the background. So today we are in Caesarea and what's unique about this city that we're visiting today is that it was given as a gift from Agus Caesar to Harrod The Great. Not a bad present! A whole city. Apparently it took a whole 12 years to complete this city as a gift. I'm usually not willing to spend more than 12 minutes to shop for someone. Music playing Here were are at the Hippodrome. This is where chariot racing used to take place. Yee-Hah! Galloping. To infinity and beyond! Music in the background. Over here you can see a lot of people enjoying watersports, kayaking, boating. There is a whole bunch of activities going on. Music in the background. So this is a city that really flourishes during the Byzantine Period and it even expanded 400 acres just around the center of Caesarea. howeever, after the arab conquest the city started going downhill and many of the people just abandoned the place and it became a forgotten village. And today we just have ruins. Music playing in the background. So where might you be sitting? Ahhhh, Roman toilets are great. Okay, so back in the day there would have actually been running water to flush away you know...wayward turds. Music in the background. More music playing. And that concludes our brief visit to Caesarea. More music playing. For lunch today we're having a Druze meal and I'm standing right beside an olive tree. Ooh, with little olives. You can see them. Background music playing. And she's preparing kebabs. There is cabbage, there is stuffed lime beans. Background music playing. We're going to have a feast of a buffet about to take place, so come let me show you all the good food. Background music playing. So the food is amazing. I think my favorite so far is this chicken. Which is stuffed with rice and lots of spices. This is such an amazing feast. Everything I've tried so far has been good. Background music playing. That was the feast of all feasts. I am super stuffed. I promised myself I was only going to have one plate but I ended up going back for seconds and then also dessert. Today we've got a lot activities planned. We're going to be covering a lot of Jerusalem, so this is just a compilation of our day's adventure. Background music playing. More background music playing. Market noises. Fluffy! Meow. You've got a pretty little friend. Background music playing. More background music playing. Music playing in the background Welcome to the Fauzi Azar Inn. So we're now in the old city of Nazareth and we're staying in a really cool place that we want to show you. This right here happens to be a 200 year old Arab mansion and it has been turned into a guesthouse. And it's truly amazing, so we'll give you a tour of the place. Music playing in the background. So what makes this place feel even more like home is that you can come into the kitchen any time of day and you can make yourself a cup of tea with plenty of variety to choose from or you can enjoy some cake that is home made. That's my favorite part and these are really good. Music playing in the background. I really like that this place has a indoor and an outdoor setting. Both for social areas, for eating, for meeting with people, for doing whatever you want. So earlier today we met Maoz who is the man responsible for bringing this vision to life. He was telling us that when he first found this place the courtyard was used as urinals by people because the place was just completely abandoned. It had fallen into decay but he saw potential to turn this into a guest-house where travelers could come together and this is what you get. 0:00:04.339,0:00:05.779 Rawwwwwr That was pathetic 0:00:05.779,0:00:10.170 Let me show you how to rawwwwr Rawwwwwr 0:00:10.170,0:00:15.400 So this lovely dinosaur friend of ours is actually a sculpture made from old military 0:00:15.400,0:00:22.400 equipment that was left in the area. These little aliens remind me of the movie 0:00:25.160,0:00:32.160 men in black So behind me we have what's left of the temple 0:01:15.149,0:01:19.789 of Pan. This was a temple built to the God of the forest and the God of the Sheppards. 0:01:19.789,0:01:24.509 Kind of like Peter Pan. And yeah the Greeks passed through here and this is what they 0:01:24.509,0:01:24.759 left. So today we are at Dan Gourmet here in Tel Aviv. We are going to be taking a cooking class and it is starting. We add some sugar and this is the mixing method. Everything goes together. Background music playing. I've got my apron on and I'm ready to cook. So what are you doing now? I've been put in charge of flipping eggplants. Background music playing. Sizzling sound. Background music playing. Sizzling noises. Background music playing. So we're trying some tahini now. And apparently we're going to be using that for the meat. It's really tangy. Delicious. What's it made of? Sesame seed paste. Background music playing. Some nice tahini. This is our version of pizza. Background music playing. You're struggling Sam. What's happening right now. I'm the worst cook in the kitchen. You need some flour. Background music playing. Here I've got Lahmacun. Hopefully I pronounced it properly. It's got lamb and tahini. Oh, it's going to be good. It's like Israeli pizza. Hahaha. Delicious. Lahmacun. This one is a little toasted. We forgot it in the oven. So, extra crispy. Mmmmm. That's really good. Can you taste the tahini? You can really taste the lamb. That's my favorite part. The lamb meat. Mmmmmm. Background music playing. So we have our charred eggplant with tahini ready to be devoured. So it's picnic time. What are you carrying? This is just for me. Just kidding. What is everyone else eating? What is everyone else having? So here is the fruit of our labors. We've got a nice little picnic feast. Let's check that out. Oooh! And a beautiful patio setting. Background music playing. So that concludes our cooking class at Dan Gourmet. We've been here for two and a half hours just cooking and eating and trying everything we've made so we are stuffed and hopefully we'll get to try some of these recipes eventually once we have a kitchen of our own. Music playing So this morning we are visiting an Olive press but before we learn how oil is made we are just walking around the farm and we've met a nice little horse over here. Music Playing This is the same olive oil that is settled a year. Okay. And it is still very high quality but the taste is good. So which one is better the fresh. Ahhhhh. The older one is better. This is olive oil straight from the press. Mmmmmmmm Right now we're high atop Mount Precipice. Overlooking the city of Nazareth. Music playing We have no arrived at Haifa and we're visiting the Baha'a Gardens and this place is amazing. It's just lined with palm trees, eucalyptus trees, flowers. Music playing You'd think after visiting all of these religious sites I'd actually remember to wear pants but no. I actually just love wearing dresses. That's all. Looks good on you. It does.

So we're going to be wandering around, sampling some food and showing you what it is like over here on a Sunday. Background music playing. So you can buy a lot of handicrafts here at this market. For example, silk, scarves, wood carvings. You can get some paintings. They have ceramics. Silverware. Lots of jewelry. I mean you can browse here for hours on end. And trinkets galore. Mmmmm. Background music playing. When you get tired of walking around in the night market you can just head over here to sit down and relax and get a nice Thai foot massage. Thirty minutes for two dollars right? Probably. Background music playing. Actually it's 80 Baht for the foot massage. You can get a cheaper one at the Chiang Mai park. background music playing. Sizzling noises. Crowd noises. One spring roll. Yeah. One tempura. One of this. One of this? Ah, yeah one. Well you sure loaded up with some tasty treats. Okay, so this is my second dinner. I have some deep fried tempura eggplant with a sweet and sour sauce on top and fresh spring rolls with carrots and cilantro maybe and some noodles. Okay, try one of them? And that would be? It tastes very healthy. Hahaha! Is it good? Mmmm, it's not as flavorful as I would have hoped. Here, have a look. It's actually bean sprouts not noodles. I was wrong. Bean spouts and tofu and some carrots. And what is this over here? Well, I must have been a monkey in a past life because whenever I get a chance to try a banana I'm always in there. And this is the deep fried version. So, it's already kind of smushed up here. Awesome. Does it have some kind of special sauce over top? No, there is no special sauce it's just deep-fried and the banana is really mushy and moist in the inside. Okay, this is my tempura eggplant. Mmmm. Okay, that tastes a lot better. It's almost like a french fry. Can I say that? Yep, it has a nice sweet and sour sauce over top and it's very oily. Um, but that means it is very flavorful. French fry on a stick. Background music playing. And that concludes our visit to the hectic Chiang Mai Sunday Night Market. Background music playing. Today we're taking a fun little day trip outside of Chiang Mai. We are visiting the Elephant Nature Park, which is about sixty kilometers outside of the city. This is an elephant rescue and rehabilitation center, so we're going to be showing you around. This center is also a refuge for a number of injured and abandoned animals such as dogs, cats, water buffalo and others. We have a bucket full of fresh fruit and on today's menu for the elephants are bananas and watermelons. Hi Baby! There you go. No bananas. Nope! That was my first time touching an elephant and there skin is surprisingly course and hairy. Right now the rescue center is home to thirty seven elephants. Thirty two of them are female and five of them are male. These are Asian elephants, which vary from the African elephant. The African elephant is actually a lot larger than the Asian elephant and they also have much bigger ears. Most of the elephants on the site have been rescued from logging, tourism and begging industries. This is the happiest time of day! The elephants are now being bathed. Overall, the experience at the Elephant Nature Park has been phenomenal. We've really enjoyed having an opportunity to feed, bathe and interact with all of the elephants. It is a great alternative to doing the trekking where you are just sitting on top of the elephant and they are working. This way you get to spend time with the elephant in its natural environment feeding it and just having a great time. This morning we're venturing up to Doi Suthep and there is a temple atop the mountain overlooking Chiang Mai, so we're going to be taking a red songthaew to get there and hopefully the views of the city will be amazing. Here is the songthaew crew! Say hi! Hi! We're going to Doi Suthep. Woo Hoo! We just got out of the vehicle and this is our first vantage point. Unfortunately, it is still a bit hazy outside, so we don't have a great view at the moment. But the city is there somewhere. The long climb begins. I'm not entirely sure how many steps we have to go but I know it is going to be a long way. I think there is over three hundred. Ideally you should be able to see the views of Chiang Mai from up here but today it is just really hazy, so there is a cloud hanging over the city. We can't really see much, which is unfortunate. That concludes our visit to Doi Suthep. It is definitely different than what I expected. I was kind of expecting this quaint little temple on top of a hill and instead it is an extremely popular tourist attraction. It is really crowded over here. I would say the exterior of Doi Suthep is quite similar to a lot of the other Wats we have visited here in Chiang Mai. However, the highlight for me was actually going inside the temple because there is a courtyard with a golden stupa and you can walk around light candles and there is incense burning, so that was a great experience. You know we love to eat, so today we've signed up for a cooking course where we're going to learn how to make some of our favorite Thai dishes. Right now we're at the local market, so we're just going to be walking around picking out some of the ingredients we'll need today for the class. Let's have a look. Judging from the amount of cooking videos we make you'd probably think that we're constantly in the kitchen and that we always like to cook. That couldn't be further from the truth. Most of the time when we're on the road we eat out, so this is actually kind of an excuse to get into the kitchen and cook and to actually try and make food because normally we don't do that. We have now arrived at the Thai Farm Cooking School. We drove about seventeen kilometers outside of Chiang Mai and it is a completely different world out here. We're just surrounded by nature and an organic farm. We're actually going to be picking a lot of vegetables from here. We had a choice between doing the cooking course in the city or going out to the countryside and I think we've made the right decision. Now clean rice already. Please come inside. I would like you to pick by yourself the whole leaf basil. I'm making my Yellow curry paste. Pound, pound, pound! Harder! Faster! Stronger! So Sam is lagging a little behind right? Come on. Master Chef here - look at that. Perfection. No, I really am lagging behind, I better hustle up. I'm making a yellow curry today. This is mine. This is what I created and Sam went for the green curry, so this is his. And I'd like to point out I don't think he did a very good job. Oh, that just fell in there. What is this? Whatever. Total chunks. You get an F! Alright, oh! It's boiling! It is not supposed to boil. We're making the Tom Yum soup. Mine is going to have shrimp and I've got my coconut milk here, so I'm going to be adding some ingredients - mushrooms, onions. I'm ready to try fine creation. This is my Tom Yum with shrimp. Let's see. I made mine really sweet. I think maybe I put in to much sugar but it is kind of nice and creamy because I used coconut as a base. You need to add more salt or fish sauce then. Mine does need more salt. How is yours? You look like a farmer drinking soup. I'm keeping this hat I swear. I'm quite happy with mine. I put quite a bit of salt in it and I also put fish sauce. I'm making my Yellow curry now. I'm just stirring the coconut milk. I put in the curry paste I made earlier. There is also some pumpkin and potatoes and I accidentally added some leaves that I wasn't supposed to but shhhh.....Cheater! Not that we've chopped everything up we're going to be throwing this into the Wok and making our stir fried rice. I was wrong about this dish. It is not a stir fried rice. It is just a vegetable stir-fry. It's really good. I made one with chicken and string beans and mushrooms and here is my yellow curry with potatoes and pumpkin. Is it good? Uh-huh. At this point in the day I'm getting completely stuffed. I actually wouldn't mind taking a siesta right now but we're going to be making two more dishes. I'm going to be making a Pad Thai and then a Mango Sticky Rice. So I'm suffering from what my family calls bulbous plumptitude. I'm making Pad Thai. Your favorite. Here is my Pad Thai which is probably one of the easier Thai dishes you can make. We saved the very best for last. Here we have our favorite Thai dessert - Mango Sticky Rice - and it has some deep fried Mung Bean on top. It is crispy. This is going to be good. Alright, let's check out that first bite. It is nice and coconut-y and it is amazing. So overall that was a really cool experience learning how to cook Thai food. I made five different dishes. I'm beyond full. Like I feel like I'm ready to hibernate now. So this was 1100 Baht. It was like lunch and dinner and the thing I really liked about this particular school was that it was out in the countryside where we were able to get outside of the city and away from the pollution and whatnot and just have a really cool organic cooking experience. So it is Saturday night in Chiang Mai and today we are heading to the Saturday Night Market. Well, we're still a few blocks away but I know we're close. You know why? Because I can smell the food. Background music playing. What do you got there? So I got myself a twisted potato which is a lot like the tornado chips we used to have in Korea. It looks like it is all seasoned? It's nice. Barbecued flavored. You're going to be sharing that? You are wasting the chips. Background music playing. Yes, blueberry. That looks good. It's like blueberry cheesecake with ice cream. It's going to be messy. Snow ice cream with blueberry sauce drizzled over top. How articulate. Mmmmmmm. Live music playing from the streets. Background music playing. So what did you get? I've got some pan-fried dumplings that are very similar to the Korean gun mandu that we often had when we were living as teachers in Korea. So let's see if these are as good? They look hot. Yeah. Pretty good. Background music playing. Someone found his favorites here. So what started as just a little snack out here at the market has turned into a full on feast. I've got dim sum and fried spring rolls. Looking good. I got this - German sausage. Very good. Background music playing. And in case we didn't quite have enough to eat - a sweet little dessert treat. So that is a banana and egg roti with lots of chocolate and condensed milk drizzled over top. Background music playing. We came to this night market. We were supposed to go for a walk but guess what? We ended up having a massive feast and so instead of exercise we were gorging the whole time but it was worth it. So today we are back at our favorite Thai restaurant but we're going to be having a special meal. We have ordered a set for two people that focuses on Northern Thai dishes, so we are going to get a sampling of different curries that come along with sticky rice. And this is what it might look like. Our first dish has arrived and it is called Khao Soi and it is fried noodles on top of a hearty curry. That looks amazing. It does. Let's dig into that baby. I'm going to try my first fried noodle. I've never had anything like this. It's kind of nice and the curry is kind of spicy. How is that? It's a very flavorful spicy curry. I can tell it is made from coconut milk. It's not a very thick curry. It is more stew-like and soup-y but it is really nice on a warm day like this. I'm enjoying it. Sticky rice inside. So a lot of the Northern Thai dishes have pork in them, so as you can see over here we have a pork sausage. We have something that looks like ground pork with nice green herbs and this might also be pork if you ask me. One of the characteristic elements of Northern Thai food is that you eat your side dishes with sticky rice. This is going to be tasty. So I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be using my hands or not but because this is sticky rice I am. We're going to dip it over here and see how it tastes. Spicy or sweet? This one is surprisingly sweet. So I'm going to try one of these little puffs in another kind of dipping sauce. That looks like it could be spicy. Yeah, it is spicy. Burning your mouth? We also have a nice pumpkin stew over here with tofu. Spicy? Not spicy. It's just really hot. Okay, what is next? So next up in the dishes to try here would be the ground pork. It looks like it has been marinated in a nice little sauce. Very strong flavor with the sauce. It looks like soy sauce but that is hard going down. Very tasty though. So it is only our first week in Chiang Mai in Northern Thailand but we are quite quickly discovering that this part of the country has a lot to offer in the cooking department. Normally, when you think Thai food you think of Pad Thai, Green Curries but really there is so much variety here. Today we had dishes that we had never even heard of before and they were so tasty. We still don't even know exactly what they are. We don't know the n ames. I'm sure we will learn them over the course of our time here but for now what we can tell you is that Northern Thai food is really tasty. So just when we thought the meal was finally over and we are so stuffed they bring dessert out for us and it is amazing. So here you can see bananas. Those are just slices of bananas in a sweet, thick coconut cream and it is amazing really. Oh yeah, you need to try it. I want to see your face when you bite into that. Wow! It almost has a bit of a rum caramel type flavor which really accentuates the coconut milk. That was seriously the feast of feasts. We paid 300 Baht in total for that which is roughly ten US dollars and it was worth every penny or should I say every Baht. It's a lovely day here in Chiang Mai and we're going to give you a tour of our neighborhood. Background music playing. So we live in a very residential neighborhood and in this area you're going to a see a lot of traditional homes, as well as luxury mansions, so let's have a look. Background music playing. Hi, Puppy. You're cute. Do I smell nice? Background music playing. Hi puppies. How are you? Hello. You're cute. Look at you. Barking. Hello Puppy. So we've encountered lots of friendly dogs this morning. One of my favorite things about this neighborhood is that we live right by Chiang Mai Gate and it is a great place to get lots of really tasty street food at night and the best part is that it is so cheap. So you can get mango shakes and mango sticky rice, noodle soups. There is just so much good stuff to eat there. And what is your favorite part about our neighborhood? I like just how peaceful and quiet it is. Chiang Mai can be a really hectic and chaotic city in certain sections but where we live it's just tranquil. And one of the perks of living in our neighborhood - we live right beside a Silver temple. Background music playing. So that is an example here of one of the moor traditional style Thai homes. And right across from it you have a super modern mansion I'd say. Background music playing. So that concludes our tour of the neighborhood and we'll show you a different part of the city next time.",False,"20140601 - Things to do in Chiang Mai, Thailand ∩╜£ Top Attractions Travel Guide To Chiang Mai.en.srt"

Korean men chanting and speaking Background music playing More music playing So we have some really cute Korean socks. I think I'm going to get the couples pair. We could get once of these. Background music More background music So what are we waiting for? We are waiting to get our couple caricature drawn and hopefully we'll be wearing traditional Korean dresses. It's caricature unveiling time. The big reveal. Ta-Dah! That's us. Awesome huh? Hahaha...yes Hey, sexy lady. Opp Opp Opp. We're at the Korean folk village today and we're here to experience traditional Korean culture. This is located in between Suwon and Yongin, which is in the Gyeongi-do province and behind me is something that looks like a smoking penis. We've been wanting to come here to the Folk Village for a few months now but we waited until the very end of fall. It is now the first week of November and as you can see the colors are now perfect. I have a clump of candy in my cheek. Nice! We just bought some sticky rice taffy and it is all natural. It is very sweet. It is kind of like a chewy candy. The tightrope walker Audrey. The magnificent Audrey. Nice. We are now going to a scholars home - come see. Here in the scholars house we can see the different kinds of hand weaving and the different baskets on display along the wall. We've got some giant traditional pots used for drying red peppers and other things. Other things? Maybe kimchi. It is used for storing kimchi. What is this? That is a Korean traditional toilet and it is a small hole in the ground. You better have good aim I'm telling you. What are you doing? It is dry corn it is not very tasty. Who is the workhorse in the relationship? Clearly, I am. Carry the load. Carry the heavy load. Fetch the water. I'm just going to walk around. It is actually kind of heavy. We've been walking around for a few hours now and we've watched several performances and visited the little shops. They sell lots of souvenirs. You can buy local treats. It has been fun. Behind me are Korean totem poles. They are somewhat similar to the ones that you can find in Canada in North American and also in the US. The big difference here is that these are a lot slimmer and the facial expressions are quite something. You can look. They look happy. That was our day at the Korean Folk Village. We are done. Is this how carpenters do it? Okay, behind me is. I am standing on a bridge and it says please do not enter because this place is very slidy. Look at the man sliding all over. It is eating you. Owe. Today we're going to visit one of our favorite places, the cat cafe. MEOW! This one is in Hongdae. Yes it is. It's a great place too. Cats making noises. Well someone is sure popular. I am. What are you feeding them? I'm giving them some chicken breast. Owe! Feed me now! It's got sharp teeth. Owe They're like hurry up, I'll take it from you. So today we're at one of our favorite places in Seoul, it's called the Cat Cafe. It's located in Hongdae which is a popular university area. And what the deal is about this place is you come here, you pay for your drinks and then you get the opportunity to roam around and pet with a whole bunch of different cats. As you can see there is one sleeping right against my jacket. Oh, that's cute. Cute kitty! And this little one was sleeping a second ago. Prrrr! And here is a cute little kitty in a box. It's wearing a little taekwondo outfit. Music playing He who has the chicken bits is the popular one. This is Sam in his element playing with all of the cats. So popular! Hello beautiful. One of the reasons I really like this place is because of the cat to person ratio. There is a lot of cats and just a few people. I like this place because it is really easy to find cats affection. Even if you just go to the counter and get some chicken or beef jerky. And in an instant voila best friend. You're surrounded by like 10 cats, so it's great. And here is a wall of the different kitties you can meet. They all have names and background information. Your face is hilarious! I'm feeding a lion here! And there is some kitties hanging out up top here. Hello! We're going to go try to feed the kitty that is up top. Let's see if it wakes him up. There we go. Hungry fella! Kicking and rolling sound of the ball. This one is pre-occupied with my bag. What are you looking for? This one looks like my cat Tommy back home. Let's get a close up. Tommy? Hey Tommy! This one has been here the whole time and now it is curled up and sleeping. Today we're back at the cat cafe and as you can see. Oh no! Hahahahaha! There is a fight. Oh my gosh! And what are we doing at the cat cafe? Feeding them when they are not fighting. Hahahaha! That's awesome. Meow. Behave! Behave little kitties. That's so mean. The other one was nice. I'm going to go feed him. We were just given some cat food on our hands and now my job is to get this off. How does my hair look? Marvelous! We are at Namdaemun market today. It is the largest and oldest open air market in all of Korea. We are going to show you the different kinds of foods you can buy in this alley. That looks pretty appetizing - what do you have there? It sure does. Well, we found some food on a stick here. They are different kind of battered food objects. If you want to take a look. We've got what appears to be a rice cake, kind of a lobster roll and as we go down a bit we've got sort of like a hot dog or sausage thingamajig. This is our first snack of the day. It looks tasty - let's try it! Okay, I'm going to have the rice one. Very classy! Nice! Alright, you're up. What are you going to have? I'm going to take a bite out of the hot dog, so let's see. Scarf it! That is nice and spicy. Is it? This is really good. Yeah. You'll have to try this one too. Sexy undies. Sexy undies. It is almost Halloween and as you can see we have a little pumpkins. Look at what we've got up here. It's a spider! When I first met Sam he agreed to wear one of these for Halloween. Of course I did. Oh, yeah. How about right there. Nice and pink which is just my style. Hotteok. Alma-eh-oh. Cheon Won EE Eh yo. So we have got a delicious treat called Hotteok. It is a fried kind of sweet treat. Inside it is filled with cinnamon, honey and sugary kind of goodness. You bite into it and it is really warm. It is perfect for the fall or winter. I will take the first bite here. Oh yeah, that is good. We found ourselves a nice little back-alley to enjoy. To feast on the hotteok. It is delicious. Show us how it is done. It is hot. Owe. Oh, nice the gooey-ness. It is made of honey. It is called Malt. M A L T. Actually honey is liquid, right? With boil this for one week and make it solid because I have to show you my performance. That is corn flour. You make a hole like this. You stretch, stretch little by little. This is a scuba diver. This store right behind us sells some medicinal herbs including ginseng. In a bottle. In here we have some interesting Korean style masks. They have various different exaggerated faces. One of them is happy. This one not so much. For those visiting Seoul, the Cheonggyecheon, this gorgeous little steam right in the heart of Seoul. It is one of the nicest places to go walking. This stream did not exist a few years ago. It was made quite recently. This is obviously a much nicer place in the summer time. It is a lot greener and they have some festivals and art installations happening. There are a lot more people as well. Especially on a weekend on a hot summer day. It is packed! One of the nice things now is that we kind of have it to ourselves. Look, there is just a few people walking by and that is it. And you are shaking it. Off on the other side of the river we can hear some traditional Korean music as well as the sound of stomping horses, which kind of helps us tell the story that they are showing on the ceramics. Interrupting my pan. Hello, handsome. Over here we've found an artificial ice sculpture and I'm guessing with the lights that are set-up around it must look really spectacular at night. Here we have another ice sculpture - a frozen Christmas tree. Today we are visiting the Shin Old Tea House where we will be enjoying a cup of traditional tea. Right now we find ourselves in a very cozy little tea house. It is very cute. They have low dim lighting and tapestries and pillows on the ground, so we've ordered ourselves some nice fruity teas. This tea house is located just off of Insadong, which is known as sort of the cultural hub street of Seoul. We've found this quaint little place. As we've placed our orders we have some delicious looking snacks. This looks like rice cake and maybe another rice cake covered in honey with little cereal chunks on top maybe. Let's try this. Crunchy huh? Okay. It is like puffed rice - like rice popcorn maybe. It has like honey on the outside and it is very sweet and airy. Here is the ginger tea and the masilcha is the plum tea. How is the plum tea? It is delicious. Mine is so sweet it is almost like liquid honey but it is not too overwhelming. It is really nice. There is plenty of flavor aside from it being sweet. What kind of tea did you get over there? I got ginger tea. The same thing - it is a nice sweet tea with a really strong ginger flavor. It is just a perfect way to warm-up on a winter day. Oh, yeah. I'm going to try one of these now. It is a rice cake with a green swirl in it. I'm not sure what the green swirl is because I can't taste any difference. Is it kind of plain tasting? It is just a regular rice cake. We're receiving heat from two different sources - an electric fan up above us and then we also have the ondul system on the floor. The heated floors by the heated pipes underneath. We're as toasty as you can get. I feel like I could take a nap in here. I probably could too. Getting off of Insadong's main strip is a really good idea because it is usually in the back alleys where you can find traditional restaurants, traditional tea houses and just quieter places. It is much better value and also has traditional homes as well which is the same as here. We are finished sadly our tea is gone. It is time to wrap things up and head back into Insadong for a little shopping and maybe some cake. Now we are at Bauh House cafe near Hapjeong station where you can come and play with all kinds of dogs. How many friends do you have now? Two so far. The dog cafe is very similar to the cat cafe. You come in and order a drink basically and that allows you to stay as long as you want. Drinks are a little bit more than normal but 'hey' you get to play with dogs. This one has beautiful eyelashes. Look at you. That one is so tiny. Bring him here. This is my local kimbap restaurant. We are at my local kimbap restaurant. This is a place where I eat several times a week. Sometimes several times a day. It is a very small space, a very quaint room and they have excellent food. Here is the menu here at the kimbap restaurant. As you can see a lot of things are between 2000 and 4000 Won. This here is our banchan. We've got kimchi, some egg rolls (kyeran) and I'm entirely sure what this is. I can see my rice being prepared here from a distance. This is awesome. Here comes my kimchi fried rice and soup. Alright. Here we are. We've got the chamchae jjigae, the spicy Korean soup with tuna. Over here is the kimchi fried rice which is typically topped with an fried egg on top. They brought us - they got it mixed up here. I'm having the rice and Audrey is having the soup. Is this what you order most of the time? Oh, yeah. This is my favorite meal - it is called Chamchae jjigae. It is kind of like a tuna stew and it is very spicy. It has onions and a little bit of tofu and some veggies. It also comes with a side of rice. It is quite healthy. It is a very filling meal and it is only a little bit over $4 USD, so I'm happy with the price. The nice thing about restaurants in Korea is that when you finish your side dishes you can always ask for more and it is all free. We've got two here to replenish. One of the reasons we like to come to the kimbap restaurant especially for me is that we do live a sort of a backpacking lifestyle. We like to save up for travel and by coming here we get to have delicious Korean food at a real cheap price. What are you having today? I'm having kimchi bokumbap, which is kimchi fried rice. It is also a spicy dish and it is my favorite way to eat kimchi. I really like it when it is fried. I already know it is going to be good. Today we are in the city of Damyang and we are going to be visiting a bamboo park. You've made some new friends I see! I sure have. They have lots of very friendly pandas here at the bamboo forest. They look quite snuggle-y. It looks like you've made some friends as well? I just love hanging out with the ox. Nice! So aside from cheesy inanimate objects, the reason we're here is actually for the bamboo forest and the trees as you can see. Korean couples have put their names on the bamboo tree with a cute little love heart. We've found our own peaceful little spot, so we're just going to relax for a little bit now. As you can see the Koreans professing their love on the bamboo trees. Come down! So did we! S loves A. It is 360 time. We're going to give you a tour of the bamboo forest. Bamboo forest 360! Muah! Look happy! Tea, we're going to drink tea. After a long journey we have finally arrived at the Boseong Tea Plantations and now we have to climb these steps in order to reach the top. This is the steepest part of the climb and we're almost near the top and they actually have ropes for you to climb up. We climbed all the way to the top. That is where we started. From the highway all of the way here. Yes. We finished our hike so now it is time for a little treat. Here in this little cafe you can get all things made with green tea, so we are going for the green tea ice cream. Of course we are! Let's go get it. No spoon! You're devouring it. I am. This stuff is delicious. You can really taste the green tea flavor can't you? Sometimes you get the green tea ice cream and you can barely taste it but this is a nice strong flavor. The real stuff! Let's get a close up. Shake your booty. Cone? And there is going to be a performance here. I have no idea what it is but it should be awesome. They said please don't try this at home. Today we are at Gyeongbokgung Palace in central Seoul and this is the best known of the five Grand palaces in the city. Admission is only 3000 Won, which is less than $3 USD. As you can see you can also pose with the guards. Now we are going to go check out the changing of the guard ceremony, which takes place at the front gate. The guards are dressed in traditional costumes. Here were are in Myeongdong probably the most popular shopping district in all of Seoul. It is more of an upscale place. It is sort of a market type environment where everything is stores and upscale boutiques, clothing shops and expensive restaurants. Swanky this and swanky that. Come join me for a walk in Myeong Dong. Look at what we got here. Nice! Is it big enough? Take a bit of that. Take a look at this. I think it is big enough to share. Is that the biggest ice cream you've ever had? Yeah, that is really good. And here in Myeongdong a little girl having her caricature drawn. We have Louis Vitton and of course that is a store I can afford. One of my favorite stores in the world is massive here in Seoul - Forever 21 and we are looking here for boots. Insanity! One of the most popular areas in Korea for students to come is a place called Hongdae, which is near a university called Hongik University and several other prominent universities in Korea. What I'm going to show you now are a series of time-lapses from different places in Hongdae and you're going to get a sense of just how busy it is - how much hustle and bustle, how much shopping. Enjoy! Hey buddy! Come here. We are exploring Songtan today. It is an area known for lots of foreigners. There is an American military base over here. They have lots of foreign restaurants. We are checking out this area and if you want to hook up you came to the right spot. Should we go to the hook up club later on baby? Perhaps. Songtan is full of restaurants that cater to foreigners so we are going to show you some of those. Mexican. Turkish. Thai. Japanese. Brazilian. Korean barbecue. English. Chinese. Indian and Pakistani. We just found some very colorful wigs over here. I am debating going for a blue bob cut. What do you think? Would that look good? You should get it. Yeah. I'll buy it for you. Yeah, so I am on a quest for deodorant. How are you smelling right now? I'm okay but I could use some soon. And look at what we found - some deodorant. Some we're not going to stink up the whole country now huh? We were a little ripped off I think. We paid eight dollars for each of these. Yeah, we were definitely ripped off. It just seems like a bit much. It's the price to pay to smell good in Korea. I guess. What do you got there? Bracelet made in India. Let's see it. We are visiting Seoul Tower and we will be climbing Namsan, which is South Mountain in the city of Seoul. We've got quite the climb to get there. It is a beautiful fall day. The colors are looking very bright and we are just getting ready to climb up Namsan. The easiest way to get up the mountain is of course by cable car. We're going to hike it because we need the exercise. We're getting close to the tower and here are some impressive views of the city of Seoul down below us. After a long climb this is the object of our affection right behind us - Seoul Tower. And if climbing the mountain wasn't enough you can even do more exercise. Work it baby! Where are we? We're here at Namsan Tower - Seoul Tower! Today we're visiting Namsan Tower now know as Seoul Tower. It is still rolling. Oh, car coming. Bloopers. Namsan Cable Car. Ok, let's do this for real. Am I on? Yeah, of course I'm still filming.",False,20140601 - Things to do in Korea ∩╜£ Top Attractions Travel Guide To South Korea.en.srt

Here is our list of the 25 best things to do in Berlin. The East Side Gallery is the longest remaining strip of the of the former dividing wall between East and West Berlin. Today the 1.3 kilometer long wall stands as a memorial to freedom and it is covered in art and graffiti. Right now we're visiting Brandenburg Gate. This gate dates back to the 18th Century. It used to be one of the old gates leading in to the city. Now after the wall came down in 1989 this became a symbol of unity between East and West Germany. It is an important site to visit. And just behind the gate is the Hotel Adlon. This is where Michael Jackson infamously dangled the baby. We're here at Tiergarten, one of the biggest parks in the city. It is a nice quiet green escape from the city center. We're loving just walking around. This park actually used to be the King's hunting grounds because it was full of wild deer and other animals. MauerPark is a hipster hangout. Every Sunday people flock to this park and spend the day barbecuing, listening to music, enjoying a few beers, and simply having a good time. There's a popular flea market where you can pick up old vinyls and clothes, and if you head over to the Bear Pit you can catch some karaoke and musical performances. If you want to spot some cool street art, then head over to Friedrichshain. This neighborhood is home to a lot of old warehouses turned cafes and art galleries, and they exude a very cool vibe. You can't come to Berlin and not eat a Currywurst! This is the city's most popular fast food snack. The sausage is served with a ketchup and curry powder concoction. It's delicious! Up next we're at the Reichstag building which has a pretty cool glass dome on top. This dome is actually open to visitors and it offers 360 degree views of the city but the only thing is that you need to sign up well in advance. Today we're visiting Tempelhof, a re-purposed airport here in Berlin. This is the first time, I must say, that I've ever walked on a runway. What is so cool about this park is that it has been re-purposed and now people are enjoying all kinds of leisure activities. There is a dog park, there is people inline skating, riding bicycles, jogging, walking and having picnics. This is such as awesome place just to come and hangout. If you enjoy museums and art galleries you'll want to visit Berlin's Museum Island. They actually have five different museums here and if you get a daily pass for 18 Euros you get access to all five. We are now visiting the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin. It is also known as the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. The artist's idea when he was creating this was to create a sense of confusion and uneasiness when we walk through the memorial, yet it is very orderly at the same time and that is supposed to mimic the Nazi regime. We're going to be showing you this area. Charlottenburg Palace is the largest palace in Berlin and the only surviving royal residence in the city. It was home to Queen Sophia Charlotte and the interior is quite grand. Once you've browsed through the many halls and ballrooms, you should head out the beautiful gardens out back. Checkpoint Charlie was one of the crossing points between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War. Today you can get your passport stamped with the stamps of the former sectors. Located near Alexanderplatz, The Berlin TV Tower offers a great lookout over the city. Chocolate! Ritter Sport is a chocolate brand that is sold all over Germany, and while in Berlin we couldn't resist sampling a few of the different varieties. Berlin Cathedral is located on Museum Island and it's one of the most beautiful churches in the city. You wouldn't be able to tell by looking at it today, but the dome was severely damaged during the Second World War. If Currywurst is to your liking, you'll want to check out this quirky museum devoted to Berlin's favorite sausage. One of the coolest things about this museum is that they have a giant sofa shaped like a Currywurst. Renting a bike is a great way to get around the city. Most places will rent out bikes at 10 Euros per day. For a leisurely afternoon, hop on a boat and enjoy a tour down the River Spree. Of course, you cannot come to Berlin and not eat a Wurst or a sausage. I've just ordered myself one from the street. They have lots of local stands and this was only one Euro and thirty five cents. Big bite! That is so good and I got it with mustard, which is even tastier. The Friedrichshain flea market takes place every Sunday and it's a great place for people watching and a little browsing. You'll find all sorts of items for sale, ranging from old musical instruments to antique dishware. This market draws big crowds. The Germans sure know how to enjoy a hearty breakfast, and we recommend you try it too. Breakfast usually offers a wide sampling of loafs and bread rolls, accompanied with various deli cuts and cheese. We couldn't resist visiting yet another cat cafe while we were in Berlin. Unlike the cafes we have previously visited in Asia, this one was quite small and only had 2 cats, but if you're a cat lover you might just enjoy Pee Pees Katzen Cafe. While in Berlin we enjoyed a hearty meal of Schnitzel. This thin strip of meat is coated in flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs, before being deep-fried. You can order it with a side of mashed potatoes or German noodles known as Spaetzle. It's quite easy to get around Berlin using the U-bahn and S-bahn system. You can get almost anywhere, plus it's really affordable. In Berlin, there is a big Turkish population and that means there is awesome Turkish street food. Right here, I've got a donair in front of me. It only costs 3.50 Euro and this thing is a massive behemoth. I can't wait to take the first bite. Oh yeah, amazing. And that's Berlin for you! A city that has risen from the ashes of the war, which is now bursting with art, music, and life. Have you been to Berlin? We'd love to hear your favourite things about the city in the comments below. For more travel and food videos, hit subscribe! Recently we had the opportunity to visit Europa-Park, the largest theme park in Germany and second most popular theme resort in all of Europe. This was the perfect opportunity for us to rekindle our childhood passion for rides. With over eleven different roller coasters alone we quickly realized we had never been to such a big theme park. What we found cool was that the theme park was divided into different European countries. If you can't visit all of Europe going to Europa Park is like getting little slivers of it all. Accommodating up to 50,000 guests per day, we were fortunate we didn't come during peak season; however, it was still crowded. Overall, the weather was perfect, the rides were fun and it is an experience we won't forget anytime soon. This is a bit of a surprise. We have an eight hour wait for a flight in Frankfurt, so instead of just hanging around in the airport, which was our original plan, we decided to drop our bags off and come into the city. That pretty much wraps up our little visit to Frankfurt. We spent maybe three or four hours just walking around and it was really nice to just see the city without much of an agenda. I came here with quite low expectations to be perfectly honest. I had heard more or less this is just a financial hub but it ended up being quite charming here in Frankfurt and I'm definitely going to miss Germany. I've had a wonderful time traveling around the country. We aren't having much luck with the weather today. It is really rainy here in Freiburg. It is Easter weekend but we are out an exploring and we want to show you the city. Let's go have a tour. One of my first impressions of Freiburg is that it is such a great city to walk around in. That's all we've been doing so far. It's very picturesque. There are cobbled streets and it is also very historic. Thankfully, the weather has shifted dramatically for the better. Earlier we had been rained out, so we had to head back into the hotel because it was cold and windy. Now we're seeing a few patches of blue skies, so we're going to keep exploring around Freiburg.",False,20140529 - Things to do in Germany ∩╜£ Top Attractions Travel Guide To Germany.en.srt

We got up super early at five in the morning and check it out this is where we are - Angkor Wat, Cambodia! We are inside Angkor Wat and this is the largest religious structure in the whole world. This is my very first time visiting Angkor Wat but Sam over here has been to this place a whopping four times. World traveler much? How is your forth time here different from you the first, second and third? Tell us! Well the temples are certainly still as impressive as ever but there are so many more tourists here than when I first came. I would say it has tripled or quadrupled or maybe even more than that. It is just unbelievable how people are sharing the experience. This is actually a Hindu temple that was dedicated to the Hindu God Vishnu and the temple was built by a Cambodian King who helped unify the country and to also spread the Khmer influence across Southeast Asia. One of the most impressive things about this temple here is actually the massive moat that surrounds it. It is one of the first things you notice as you're coming up to the temple. There are several options for booking tickets to visit the temples of Angkor. We went with the three day option and that was $40 USD dollars but you can also go with the one day option, two day option or if you really love temples the seven days. I would image that is quite pricey. A good time to come to Angkor Wat is actually right at lunchtime because a lot of the tours, buses and tourists are out having lunch or at that point in the day temple-d out, which means they are really hot, tired and sort of seen enough temples for the day. If you want and alternative time to come definitely consider coming around between 12 and 1:30. Coming back for the forth time was amazing. I never get tired of this place but one funny observation I have is that I noticed that any family's dragging along their children really didn't seem to be enjoy this as much. They were just dragging their feet. I think it has a lot to do with the heat and humidity outside right now. It is really really hard to be walking around and not sweating profusely. I really enjoyed getting up early and coming to watch the sunrise at Angkor Wat. I thought that maybe the experience wouldn't feel special because there are literally hundreds of people also here at that time of day but it felt like we were sharing the moment together, so I really enjoyed it. Today we're going to be having a special experience. We are taking a bamboo train along these old tracks that used to run from Phnom Penh all the way to Battambang. This train is really just a bamboo platform with a few mats laid over top. It has a six horsepower engine and we're going to be speeding through and see what we find. We're on the bamboo train in Battambang! Having fun? Yes. It's going really really fast. Oh yeah! This morning we've got a special activity planned. We are taking a cooking class - a Khmer cooking class. I'm all thumbs in the kitchen but I'm going to give it my best shot. Right now we're at the local market and we are going to pickup some ingredients for the cooking class and it is raining. It's a red curry paste and this is a chili paste. They are fresh vegetables. And then they say ginger. It is not ginger. It is galangal. Coconut and then she grates it to get a coconut milk. So we've got our aprons on and we're ready to cook. Siem Reap, Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville they converse and they change how to make fish Amok. They make shortcuts for three or four minutes. I'm trying to slice lemongrass. These are our ingredients so far. They smell really good. What might you be doing? I'm just crushing the ingredients. You're making the curry paste here. It looks so good. We're really earning our meal here. We're making our curry paste. We've been pounding away for almost ten minutes now. Now we're slicing up the snake fish. I still haven't cut my finger. Here is our Amok. We made a little curry type thing and put it into the banana bowl that we've prepared and now it is going to be steamed. Here is the meal we prepared today. We have spring rolls with a nice dipping sauce, lok lak (a kind of beef meat) and over here Amok, which is fish in a coconut cream sauce. I'm going to try my Lok Lak. Let's see how this turned out. It is really nice. I cooked it myself. I'm going to try one of the spring rolls we made. I still can't believe I didn't burn down the kitchen and it is delicious by the way. We just finished our cooking class. I didn't cause an International Incident. I didn't burn down the kitchen, so overall it was a success. If anyone wants to come the Kitchen is called Nary's Kitchen and they have a morning and an evening class. It costs ten dollars a person. This restaurant and cooking school is run by Nary and her husband Toot. They will take you to the market and you will spend an hour there just looking at different vegetables, picking up ingredients and then afterwards you come back to the school you cook for two hours and then you get to enjoy your meal. We highly recommend it. Excellent food. Today we are having a feast of a dinner. We are at a Cambodian restaurant and we have just ordered ourselves an eight course meal. This restaurant is called Angkor Palms and it is highly recommended, so we have high expectations for this meal. Right now I am trying the fresh spring rolls and I think they have rice noodles inside, so let's see. Woah, that is a mega bite! That was a really good spring roll. It had some very fresh and zesty flavors and a little bit of seafood as well; so far so good. Next up, we have the spare ribs and these do look good. It just melts in your mouth. Next up we are trying the Amok, which is one of the most popular dishes in Cambodia. Amok is fish that has been coated in a coconut cream and then baked in a banana leaf. Did it hit the spot? Um-hmmmm. And she takes a second bite before I get any. This is the one thing that I'm probably the most excited about - the homemade green curry with chicken. I've got a slice chicken. Wow, I can really taste the curry. Once again, just like the spare ribs, it just melts in your mouth and I barely even have to chew. Is it coconut based? I don't think it is that strongly based, no. Up next is our shaved mango salad, which has some peanuts and mint leaves on top. Sweet? It is sweet? It is also nice and crunchy because of the peanuts. It has some nice spices and is really flavorful. You just took a second bite. And last but certainly not least is the fried water spinach. That is tasty. It has kind of a butter-y garlic flavor. Time for dessert. Tell us what you are having? To finish off we've got a sweet little treat - a tapioca based pudding with banana. Oh, take a big bite. Oh yeah, it is so sweet and so good. We have finished our feast of a dinner. I must admit, when I first saw the platter being brought over I thought 'hmmm, is this for two people? I think I could probably eat my own but in the end we still have food leftover. That was just so much to eat. It was so tasty but it was really filling at the same time."" So, it was good stuff - it was a good dinner. The 8 course platter is $14 for two people. For those who want to come here this restaurant is located right in the heart of Siem Reap nearby the Central Market. You can't miss it. Today we are visiting Choeung Ek also known as the Killing Fields here in Cambodia. This is one of the many sites scattered about the country where the Khmer Rouge executed its own people. To put it into perspective one out of four people of the Cambodian population were executed during this regime. The peaceful orchard setting it is just hard to believe the atrocities that took place. Not all of the graves have been excavated here under this lake there are still many graves where bodies were thrown. This is the kind of place where you come out feeling heavy emotions and even though it is not necessarily a pleasant visit, I think it is important to visit sites like these in order to learn a bit about the history of the countries you travel through. Visiting this site just gives me extra respect for the Khmer people how resilient they are and how they've been able to overcome these atrocities. Hopefully this memorial here will serve to educate others and future generations so that this never happens again. Today we are at an Apsara performance which includes traditional music and dance. We've also just finished feasting on a wonderful meal and we are going to enjoy the show. Normally, this evening performance show and dinner is $12 USD but we got a special deal from our guest house for only $8. I would say just the food alone is well worth that. Now we get the performance to check out. There are several parts to this performance. It includes folk music, dance and mime. Background music playing. Today we are taking you to a very happy place in Siem Reap. And where is your happy smile? Hahaha With all of these happy pizza joints to choose from I don't even know where to go. And there is ever one that is ecstatic. Wow! Background music playing. Hahahaha. Woah, what is that? Background music playing. Eating sounds. Wow! Eating sounds. Actually this is just delicious normal pizza that we're feasting on right now. So once upon a time Happy Pizza meant a completely different thing. They had a special topping that was grown in the mountains. Mmm. But recently, there has been a police crackdown on these happy pizzas so they are no longer available. Nothing like ice cold beer and one of the nice features of all of these happy restaurants around here is that draft beer is only fifty cents. Background music playing. There are never any pizza slices left when I'm around. We are here at Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum formerly known as S-21. This area used to be a former primary school and high school before being turned into a detention, interrogation and torture center. There was an estimated 20,000 people killed here between 1975 and 1978. These atrocities were committed by the Khmer Rouge which was lead by Pol Pot's regime. Today we are outside Siem Reap and we are exploring the Temples of Angkor starting with Angkor Thom. The most fascinating thing about Bayon are the cold faces that have a hint of a smile. This massive complex has 54 towers with 216 faces on them. Over here we have the Terrace of the Elephants. It is 350 meters long. This was once used as a viewing platform from where you could watch the ceremonies that took place for the King. Well, we're traveling right now in Cambodia in April and it is the hottest time of the year here. It is always hot in Cambodia but this is literally the worst month. I'm just sweating buckets. As a tip for people coming here - if you want to come at bit of a cooler time from December to January or even February it is a great time to come. It is also peak season here so you will be sharing it with more tourists but you won't be sweating as much. Tonight we're at the local circus in Battambang. It is run by an organization that helps out disadvantaged children. We're excited and looking forward to the show. This circus is for a good cause. It runs twice a week and our tickets were only ten dollars. Let's go check out the show. Today we're in Sihanoukville to check out the beach. Let me tell you what the Lonely Planet says about this place. Surrounded by white sand beaches and as yet undeveloped tropical islands Sihanoukville is Cambodia's premier seaside resort. Let me show you that: Let us tell you about a few of the things we've found on the beach: flip flops, a broken bottle of absolute vodka, a pregnancy test, a bottle of hot sauce, some fishing lines, construction materials, plastic and just lots of garbage in general. It is not just in a few select areas this is all over the beach. Totally littered. I first came here back in 2008 and when I arrived at the time this was actually quite a nice little spot. It was what you would consider an alternative to the beaches in Thailand but what has happened here over these last several years, I mean it is disgusting. This is officially in my opinion paradise ruined. I think it is a shame that people aren't taking better care of the beach because it really is a beautiful setting. You have the lush tropical vegetation and you have boats and the water is a perfect temperature but there is just so much garbage that I'm afraid of going into the water because my leg could get caught up with a glass bottle. I'm disappointed. To try and salvage this situation we're actually going to be checking in to quite a nice hotel. It is our one year anniversary. We came here with the plan of relaxing on the beach and really enjoying swimming and other activities in and around the beach area. But since it is ruined more or less we're going to have to make up for it in other ways and we're not going to be staying here nearly as long as we had planned either. This is just disgusting from both the perspective of tourists, the backpackers and the locals. I mean how could this have happened. I'm not impressed. In this case, I think both parties are to blame. Backpackers for being dirty and not taking care of their crap and throwing it in the garbage but also locals for not taking the initiative to clean up their own beach and encourage tourism. I think both parties need to step it up a little bit. Walking up early in the morning certainly has its advantages. We are the first people to arrive at this temple Banteay Srei. This is one of the temples we've been most excited to visit and we are officially the first ones here. Here we are inside the temple. This happens to be a Hindu temple and it is dedicated to the God Shiva. Most of the temples of Angkor were commissioned by powerful Kings but this temple in particular was not. It was commissioned by a Brahman, which makes it quite unique. Because we came here early we got a VIP tour. Normally these areas are gated off as you can see by the white perimeter here and the rope. Look at where we are - Yeah! The advantages of being the first on site can't be underestimated. I mean, anything to avoid those package tourists is a good idea. There are many temples to choose from but this one in particular Banteay Srei is considered to be the crown jewel of Angkorian art because it has some of the most exquisite and intricate carvings. This temple is located very far away from Siem Reap. We had to travel over an hour in a tuk-tuk and I slept most of the way but I hear it was a very scenic journey. Yes? Along the way we passed a lot of rural villages. We saw locals out doing various kinds of activities early in the morning - some farming related and some business. We saw bikes packed to the total brim full of stuff. We saw a lot of different things and it was just a really cool trip to get out here. We're going to go check out some traditional Khmer music. Cambodian music here. It's going to be awesome. Khmer music playing. That was a great performance. Hello! Hello! We are now visiting Ta Prohm, which is a Buddhist temple where the jungle just dominates the architecture. Here the buildings are wrapped in trees and some of the entrances are blocked. Indiana Jones would feel right at home here at this temple. In fact, it was used for the set of Tomb Raider staring Angelina Joli. It is decaying and it is crumbling but it is a great place to explore. This is an example of nature taking over the temple. Here you have this massive tree that is just straddling the wall really. Some parts of the temple have been completely destroyed over the centuries, which actually creates quite a fascinating atmosphere. I first visited Ta Prohm back in 2008 and 'wow' was it an entirely different experience. There was hardly anyone. I was able to walk around without encountering mass crowds. It is completely different this time and instead of sort of lamenting about it and just getting really negative about it - what I've actually been doing is just taking a lot of time-lapse shots. I'm using the crowds and the people as sort of a backdrop for filming. That is what I'm going to do throughout this entire time that I'm here exploring the Temples of Angkor. A much quieter alternative, once you've explored the temple, is to actually just walk around the perimeter. It is quite peaceful here. We're taking our final bus trip in Cambodia from Battambang to Phnom Penh. It's a six hour journey and we've got ourselves a little local snack here. It is something we've eaten before - Bamboo rice. Let's take a big bite. This time around we're in the front of the bus. Front seats! Sam has been filming some of the action. We were almost in an accident. It was so close. This car just pulled out totally without looking and we were less than a meter away from running into it. Luckily nothing happened. We're heading to Phnom Penh for just a quick stopover. We're basically just looking to get our Vietnamese Visas and then we're off to Saigon. Yeah, Vietnam it's Saigon. Owe, no be nice. You're cute. So we're taking a rural countryside tour today of Battambang. We're going to be buying some sticky rice wrapped up in a bamboo wrapper. Once it has been cooked you just kind of crack the bamboo and peel it down and there you have the rice that has been mixed with coconut cream and some black beans. It looks good. It smells great. Take a bite. How do you like it? It's delicious. It's like you can totally tell it has been made with coconut but there hasn't been a lot of extra sugar, so it is definitely a little bit sweet but it is not too sweet. I really like it. So this lovely snack is only sixty US cents. Not bad. Alright brave man going to eat a little cricket there. Time to have a cricket and this is my first time eating one. Cheers. Okay, big bite. Stick it in your mouth. You try one as well? Oh, no no no. It's actually really good. Wow! It's salty and a little bit sweet too. Oh yeah, that's good stuff. One more. Here we go. We're here at the fish market now and we can certainly smell all the fish all around here. It is just overwhelming and we're going to just check out to see what is here. So here is a form of preserve of fermented fish that our guide just told us tasted a little bit like cheese. So what is this here? Fish eggs that they're fermented here. It has a lot of salt. That is ready to eat? Yes, you take the salt out and the fish is inside. If you wrap a plastic bag around the insect can not bite it. Oh, so there is plastic wrapped around these guava fruits to prevent insects from eating them. These fill up inside the pillows and mattress. It looks very soft. Yeah, you can touch. These are the seeds for new plants? Yes, when you plant. It comes from the tree right there? It's the big one over there.

Our lovely home at sea. So we're going to give you a tour of the place. Lounging on the deck. How are you enjoying the view? Ah, they're okay. So we've been doing lots of activities while we've been at Ha Long Bay. There has been kayaking and exploring caves and this morning we are spending a bit of time at a private beach. Okay, so Sam you are revisiting Ha Long Bay for the second time, yes? Indeed, I am. Okay, so tell us what has been your favorite part this time around and how has it changed? Well, it actually hasn't changed too much. This tour is quite similar to the one I did before. Previously, I did a three day tour. This time we're doing only two days. Two days I think is plenty. We've done a lot of different fun activities. I've just enjoyed being on the boat with all of the gorgeous scenery and the karst mountains. Well, this has been my first time to Ha Long Bay so obviously what has impressed the most has been the scenery because it just looks out of this world. It is unlike anything I've ever seen before. I've really enjoyed just hanging out on the top deck reading a book, checking out the views and also the food aboard has been really nice. And next we're going to show you our room on the boat. Hello. Cabin fever. Okay, we've been here maybe half an hour and it is already messy. I blame it on this person. No, this person. Here we are just biking through the streets of Hoi An. Here we have our little ticket for sightseeing around Hoi An. The way it works is that you pay six dollars and you get a ticket that grants you access into five different historic sites around town and you just show up at the entrance. They snip off one of these little tabs and you're good to go. Here we are at the Japanese covered bridge. It was built in 1593. Construction on this bridge began on the year of the monkey and finished on the year of the dog and for that reason one side of the bridge is guarded by a monkey and the other by a dog. Here we are at the most popular pedestrian bridge in town. I'm standing here at a small square and this is where a lot of fabulous performances take place - especially at night time. We are at Quang Dong Assembly hall. It's a place of worship for the Cantonese community. Up next we are visiting the Assembly Hall of the Fujian Chinese. This place now acts as a temple to the Goddess Tian Hao who is from the Fujian province in China. Today we are doing something that I've been wanting to do ever since we got to Hoi An and that is shopping. There are said to be over two hundred different tailors just in Hoi An alone. This is a city where you come to have your clothes custom made. You can get dresses, shirts, suits, shoes, pursues made and they can copy the latest designs. You just have to show them the magazine with what you want and they'll recreate it for you. Shopping for clothes - especially dresses - is not my realm of expertise. We're going shopping. Having fun changing over there. I'm having trouble getting into my dress. Oh, it looks nice. Do you like it? It feels like the right size. This is dress number two. How do you like this one? It's got flowers. It is nice. I can do a little smaller. Maybe a little smaller in the back. It's a good size for you. Do you like it? I do. Yes, you like all three of them? We are staying here two more days. Two more days? What are we having done right now? I'm getting my dresses made, so that they fit me properly. Where are you going now? After here, we go to Hanoi. It is very far away. So we are just waiting here for Audrey's dresses to get some minor alterations done on them. Were they too big or too small? They were a little too big on me but I am so excited for them to be ready. I'm quite pleased with my purchases. I ended up getting three dresses and I probably could have gotten more because the lady just kept pushing me to try this one, try that one. She really wanted you to get that forth dress. Oh yeah, but we had to cut it off at three. Overall, we paid eighteen dollars per dress plus a slight discount and that included alterations and everything. So a little tip for anyone who is think of going shopping in Hoi An. I would say just walk around the different streets and see what the shops have to offer. See what kinds of styles you like and then go into a store and don't be afraid to bargain a little and ask for different patterns and different fabrics. They can make anything you want. Today we are biking out to Tra Que which is a little village. We're going for a special organic meal at a restaurant that grows its own vegetables and herbs. Oh, wow! Can you hear the sound of the water. This is Sam on the Waterwheel. You're a natural. If this isn't fun I don't know what is. You should move out here and take up farming. So this place is amazing. It's like a little organic oasis where they just grow different herbs and vegetables. Everyone is farming and it is so peaceful and quiet and it is beautiful. Look at all of the flowers around this. We have a very special drink here. It is called the water wheel drink. It's made with lemon basil seed and ginger. Let's take a sip of that. It tastes very healthy. In a good way or a bad way? In a pretty good way. Okay. Tra Que is a small farming community village located two kilometers northeast of the Ancient Hoi An town area. We just came here for dinner but if you decide to visit this village you can also work with the farmers for the day, you can take a rice paper making class or you can take a cooking class. If you've been following along with our recent food videos you probably have noticed we've been having these pancakes a lot and they are delicious. I have to say that the presentation of these ones down here looks the best. So these here are the best country pancakes we've had. What I really like about them is that they are not as oily or greasy as the other ones. They have a little bit of a fluffier texture. So this lovely presented dish is called three friends and there are three friends right in my hand. We have shrimp, pork and vegetables wrapped around. Pop that in your mouth. Friendly? I've got some good pals in my mouth. These tres amigos are almost too pretty to eat. Thank you. Easy. So here we have our colorful papaya salad and I didn't realize it was going to be this big. I started to think we ordered way too much food. Are you kidding me? With me here? Too much food? I'll take care of that. Well to sum up this meal I can honestly say this is the best dinner I've had since I've been in Vietnam. I absolutely loved the dishes. You could just taste the freshness in every single dish we had. The prices were really affordable. The portions were generous and it was cooked really healthy. Nothing was greasy or too oily. It was just absolute delight to come here and eat. I definitely agree. I think the long bike ride out here was definitely worth it and it is nice eating in such a quiet and peaceful setting just being surrounded by the farm. So we highly recommend it if you're in Hoi An. Hello! We are on a little raft and just cruising down the Mekong Delta. I'm loving the conical hat. How do you like your hat? I need a hat of my own. We should be wearing this back in Canada. What is wrong with people? There is a little traffic jam over here. Hello. Tip Tip? We're doing a three day tour of the Mekong Delta and this is day number one and we just started off by sampling some tea with honey and few little snacks. Now we're doing a little paddle boat adventure down the Mekong. Today we're in Saigon one of the most hectic and chaotic cities in SE Asia and we're going to show you the main attractions. The best souvenir to take back home - weasel coffee. That is coffee that has been pooped out of a weasel in case you were wondering. It looks a little bit like an O'Henry bar. There is a lot of exotic things you can buy in Vietnam. Nothing more so than snake wine. We also have some very cool chocolates over here in the shape of conical hats or you can get your own durian chocolate. Our first stop today is the War Remnants Museum in Saigon. This museum chronicles the war from the perspective of the North side. We just finished visiting the War Remnants Museum and inside it is divided into several different galleries. I would say that the most impacting gallery is the one that focuses on the results of Agent Orange. Agent Orange was a defoliant used to get rid of the leaves in the jungle, so that it would make warfare easier but the thing is that the toxins effected people decades later, so someone who had been exposed to the toxins when they were twelve years old when they had children at twenty five most of those kids were born with deformities. Thousands of people in Vietnam are effected by this. We're here at Thien Hau temple dedicated to the Goddess of the Sea. Many years ago this is where people would have come to pray for protection for a long sea journey. Over here they are burning the used incense. So the spiral coils that you see burning up there are actually incense sticks and they burn for three months, so if a family wants to have good luck they come to the temple they write their name and date of birth on a little ribbon that is attached to the incense stick and it just burns there for a few months and you're lucky the whole time. Next up it is time to go shopping at the Binh Tay Market. Let's go see what we can find. The market is a bustling hive of activity and you can buy just about anything here. I wait for you. We have some very forceful saleswomen over here. One lady grabbed onto my arm and was pulling and she would not leg go of me because I wouldn't buy a silk scarf. We are now visiting the Reunification Palace. This used to be the Presidential Palace for South Vietnam and it is stuck in a time warp. It has been left to look exactly the way it did when the North stormed through on April, 1975. This is the Notre Dame Cathedral in Saigon and it is a very easy landmark to notice because it is made out of red brick. And if you happen to be here at the right time you can even join Mass. Our last stop of the day we are visiting the General Post Office in Saigon and normally a post office wouldn't be a main attraction but this one was designed by Gustav Eiffel, the same guy who built the Eiffel Tower. The old phone booths have been turned into ATM machine stations. Although it is a main tourist attraction it still does function as a post office. And that concludes our grand tour of Saigon and we hope you enjoyed it. Well, our time in Saigon is over and we're now taking a train to Nha Trang for some beach time. Yes. And that is going to make one of us very happy. Who would that be? Oh yeah, I just love the beaches. You'll get lots more freckles. I do. I need more. I don't have enough. We have been eating local foods the whole time we have been here. Check that out. That is so Vietnamese. What is that? I think they may call that pizza. Iced cafe? I've got my favorite treat here - Vietnamese iced coffee. I paid 15,000 Dong for that which is about seventy five cents. Is it ever good. It is made with condensed milk and it has copious amounts of sugar. Take a big sip. Better than an Iced Cap from Tim Hortons back home. Okay, aside from the ice cap I think we need to discuss Sam's new look over here. A pretty obvious change. What is that? What do you mean what is that? That's my mustache. It is awesome. You love it. I'm a throwback from the seventies. There are two different classes in this train. We are traveling in the soft seat section which has AC and really cushiony chairs. Then you also have hard benches with fans. Yeah, what a big difference. I'm glad we got the ones here. It is a lot more comfortable. Chicken. We be having chicken for breakfast. One of my favorite snacks of all - fried spring rolls and I get to eat them on a train. We are going kayaking around the bay...woo! We are paddling down the Ha Long Bay. Oh yeah! Look at you paddle. I know. I'm doing all the work and Sam is just there for the ride. Exactly! You paddle girl, you go. One of the coolest things out here by far are the floating villages. We survived our kayaking experience in Ha Long Bay. We almost crashed into the cliff. Yes. It was kind of scary. It is a bit stressful especially because whenever the big boats (the junks) go past they create these little waves and the kayaking is turning. And you have to get out the way of the junk too. That is stressful. Yeah, but it was fun. It was a fun way to see the bay. Today we are eating lunch at the Bale Well in Hoi An. This is a very small local restaurant. They have a fixed menu. Actually there is no menu. They just bring you food and you pay a fixed price and you eat as much as you want. There focus is on country pancakes and spring rolls. Which we both love! You take the salad, cucumber, kimchi and a spring roll. It is going to be crunchy. Now that is a special roll. That has got meat. Thank you very much. So I dip it here? Give it a try Audrey. Here we go. How is that? Wow, hard to bite huh? So you are going to what? Well, Sam here wasn't paying attention to whole assembly process, so I will have to demonstrate how to roll a spring roll. Okay, so we add a little bit of greens including some lettuce. A bit of fumbling with the chopsticks there. Hey, don't be hating. Then she said this is our kimchi which looks a bit different from the kimchi we ate in Korea. This is Vietnamese style Kimchi. It must be pickled vegetables. Then she added a spring roll. Don't forget the meat. Let's try this one. Yeah, try a smaller one. I don't know if it is chicken or beef but it looks good and smells good. Now that is a super loaded roll. Ok, now to roll it tightly. Viola! This is it. Now you add just a little bit of chilly to the sauce. It is kind of a peanut based sauce I think. And we dip and enjoy! Oh, there comes more food. Oh wow, here is the country pancakes. Yum. So this delectable roll. This time instead of the spring roll it has the country pancake inside of it. So we're going to give it a try. Is that better? These rolls are amazing! You've got pancakes, springs rolls, the greens, the skewered satay all in this. Happy boy! And if that feast wasn't enough we've got a little sweet treat to end off with. What flavor did you get? I got cherry. And the dessert just keeps on coming. Now we have fresh pineapples. Do you have any room for that? No, but I'll eat it. Okay, seriously that was the feast of feasts. Normally country pancakes or spring rolls or satay taste great on their own but all wrapped up together in one big roll dipped into a peanut sauce. WOW! Our lunch came to one hundred and eighty thousand Dong which is about nine dollars. I think that is a great price because they just kept bringing out plates and plates of food and we were stuffed and then they were offering us dessert and it was like 'oh, I don't want to turn it down I guess I'll eat it anyway' so yeah it was a great selection there. The service there is really friendly almost in a very unique kind of way. There was one time when the lady was coming over and she looked like it appeared she was going to be wrapping up a roll for us but instead she just grabbed a satay and plopped it right in Audrey's mouth and at the very end of the meal she came over and noticed I was looking hot and she undid a napkin for me. I thought she was going to put it in my hands. Oh, no. She just came and rubbed my whole face right down. Oh yeah. Today we setting out on a two day hike in Sapa and we are just walking through the town. We've picked up a few more people who are joining us and we've already picked up some local buddies who will be walking with us it seems. Today's hike is going to be divided into three sections and the first village that we will be visiting is called Lao Chai. It's about eight kilometers from where we started out and we're two kilometers into the trek so far. It is getting really hot and I'm sweaty so let's keep going. Tell us about the scenery? Unbelievable. Everywhere we walk. So as you can see over here there is a bit of a landslide that is blocking the road into the town. I thought I heard a waterfall down there. It turns out it is just a river. It is still impressive. So after several kilometers of hiking we're finally approaching the village of Lao Chai down below. So we are about to cross this bridge into town and it is not for those who have vertigo because there are railings on this bridge. After two hours of hiking we've reached our first destination point Lao Chai Village. It is time for lunch and I'm pretty hungry. How about you? I'm starving. I can't wait to get there fast enough. It is just over there where the bridge is. That is Lao Chai. Now we're going to show you a little bit of a Vietnamese musical performance. Vietnamese singing and music. It was quite impressive. Oh yeah. This is the second day of our Mekong Delta tour. We're going to visit some traditional floating markets out here and we're rocking the conical hats. Pineapple. Pineapple. One. 10,000 Dong. Who wants a pineapple? We just finished a very hot and sweaty ride through a floating market. There were small little vessels selling things like fresh fruit and ice cold coffee. We sat there and enjoyed the scenery and ate some food. They literally had the perfect strategy down. They just had us sitting there for fifteen to twenty minutes. We were sweating profusely and they were selling us cold drinks. They must have made a fortune. Today we are visiting the central market in Hoi An. It is about seven thirty in the morning and the place is just full of activity. People are selling fresh vegetables and fruits, so let's go see what we can find. Waking up this morning has been one of the best ideas we've done since we've come to Hoi An. We've been treated to this market almost entirely to ourselves. We actually haven't noticed another foreigner here yet. Wow. One of the quirks of this market is that they sell live chickens and ducks. That is not something you see in the supermarket everyday. In tiny little cages. Here at the market you can find all kinds of exotic fruits that are associated with SE Asia such as papaya, mangosteen, rambutan, dragon fruit. It is all here. From a birds eye view perspective it is just a sea of conical hats. It is too bad we forgot to bring ours today. Today we are having lunch at the Green Moss in Hoi An and this happens to be a cooking school but it has more of a casual feel. Basically, you choose two dishes from the menu and then you pay an additional two dollars and you get to go into the kitchen and cook it yourself. That is what we'll be doing. Believe me when I say this ""If I can do it. Anyone can."" We are entering into the kitchen and we're making a cooking video. Audrey is up first. First like this? You roll one time. So you cover it up? So then we get the sides tucked in? And then we finish as tight as possible. There you go. Not so bad. It is great. It is like we're an exclusive peak into the kitchen. This is how we're making Pho. Can I try? Two tablespoons. Here are the first few dishes we've prepared. We have the Pho and the fresh spring rolls. Let's go eat it. Take them to the table and devour them. Here is the spring roll that Audrey personally rolled herself. No, I didn't. You rolled it. Do you remember? Let's see how it turned out. This is one of my favorite dishes at this restaurant. It is just such a nice fat spring roll. How is that Pho? Delicious, and prior to learning how to make this I didn't realize how many different ingredients went into this dish. You can really taste the flavors. Next up we will be making a vegetable Cao Lau. So the Cao Lau noodles are made from the water used an ancient well and apparently it is quite secret. Not only in Hoi An. Unique noodles to Hoi An. It is harder. It's a crispy noodle. Now we're making our very last dish the vegetable pancake and it happens to be my favorite one. We've got a lot of multitasking going on. We've got the tofu simmering, we've got the noodles being steamed over here and we've got the pancake mixture ready to be spread on the frying pan. So that is when we know it is done? Okay. Take fermented soy bean sauce. Here is the finished product and this is round two of our feast. It was a fascinating experience getting to see how all of this food was made in the kitchen. We're going to show you how to roll the country pancake in a rice paper, so that it is easy for dipping into the sauce. And a big bite. Oh, yeah. The pancake is nice and crispy and the sauce is kind of sweet. It has a bit of a tomato ketchup base I believe but it is also spicy because we added all of the chilies. It is a nice combination of flavors. How is the Cao Lau? I love it. What really stands out with the Cao lau is the taste of the noodles. They are just really unique to this area and I love them. So the texture of the noodles are a little bit crispy and it almost tastes a little bit like they are under-cooked but that is what makes them quite unique. We just finished our cooking class at Green Moss and it was a little bit different from previous cooking classes we've taken. This one was a little bit less hands on and more watch and learn, which is great because we got to watch a professional make it and the dishes turned out great. Everything was tasty. That is the first kind of cooking class where it has been more of a just a demonstration only that I've taken before. And I really enjoyed it partly because I'm really slow at preparing food but the other reason was it was so hot in that kitchen. I don't think I've ever sweated that much, so I could barely handle being in there as long as I was. Had I been preparing the food I may have passed out on the ground. Well our time in Vietnam has almost come to an end. We came to Sapa and all we really wanted was a room with a view but you know how things are...you don't always get what you want. Some come take a look at our room. It is just you know, nothing special. I really wanted to have a nicer view but this is just kind of ordinary. Meh. Blah. And how is it over there? It is not any better. Come see. Meh. Meh. What is your office like these days? I'm enjoying it. Not so bad. No, who is kidding who. This is just absolutely stunning. This room here costs only twenty dollars and we get free breakfast. I have to say, I've been traveling for a very long time. I've probably been backpacking almost three or four years and I have never had a room with a view like this. Off in the distance you can see the rice terraces where locals grown their crops. This view is kind of similar to Boseong Tea Plantation we visited in Korea and also the Cameron Highlands in Malaysia where we visited more tea plantations. The only difference is that we didn't have a room overlooking this. It's a much better view this time around. Well our time in Vietnam has almost officially come to an end and I can't think of a better way to spend it than here in Sapa. What do you think? Vietnam has been our favorite country to travel through in the past three months and Sapa is just a great relaxing destination to end off the trip. We are taking our first sleeper bus in Vietnam. We are traveling from Nha Trang all the way to Hoi An which should be about 12 hours and the bus basically looks like they stuffed a whole bunch of bunk beds in it. We're on the top one. I love the look on Audrey's face when she first saw this bed. I've taken these sleeper buses before but they are quite unusual buses. This is the tiniest bunkbed I've ever been on. I could fall off the side. Oh come bunny you're going to love it. It is like a sleepover party on a bus. One of the many perks of traveling on the night bus is that you save a night's accommodation. We won't be paying for a hotel or a guest house tonight. This is our hotel. We're styling. We paid about eleven US dollars for this journey and that comes to less than one dollar per hour of travel. Bargain! Are you getting a good night's rest? Very liberal use of the horn. It has been over twelve hours and we are still on the bus. We didn't really get a good night's sleep because they were just honking all night, so as soon as we get to Hoi An I'm getting my nap.",False,20140524 - Things to do in Vietnam ∩╜£ Top Attractions Travel Guide To Vietnam (Ultimate Compilation).en.srt

We are at my local kimbap restaurant. This is a place where I eat several times a week. Sometimes several times a day. It is a very small space, a very quaint room and they have excellent food. Here is the menu here at the kimbap restaurant. As you can see a lot of things are between 2000 and 4000 Won. This here is our banchan. We've got kimchi, some egg rolls (kyeran) and I'm entirely sure what this is. I can see my rice being prepared here from a distance. This is awesome. Here comes my kimchi fried rice and soup. Alright. Here we are. We've got the chamchae jjigae, the spicy Korean soup with tuna. Over here is the kimchi fried rice which is typically topped with an fried egg on top. They brought us - they got it mixed up here. I'm having the rice and Audrey is having the soup. Is this what you order most of the time? Oh, yeah. This is my favorite meal - it is called Chamchae jjigae. It is kind of like a tuna stew and it is very spicy. It has onions and a little bit of tofu and some veggies. It also comes with a side of rice. It is quite healthy. It is a very filling meal and it is only a little bit over $4 USD, so I'm happy with the price. The nice thing about restaurants in Korea is that when you finish your side dishes you can always ask for more and it is all free. We've got two here to replenish. One of the reasons we like to come to the kimbap restaurant especially for me is that we do live a sort of a backpacking lifestyle. We like to save up for travel and by coming here we get to have delicious Korean food at a real cheap price. What are you having today? I'm having kimchi bokumbap, which is kimchi fried rice. It is also a spicy dish and it is my favorite way to eat kimchi. I really like it when it is fried. I already know it is going to be good. It is a very cold winter day today so for lunch we've decided to have some Gamjatang, which is a hearty Korean stew. In Korea you cut everything with scissors - forget knives - this is the way it is done. Eat like the locals. The same with the kimchi. Let's chop that up. It looks nice and fresh. Here is the delicious stew and these are all of the different ingredients that we have for it. We've got some vegetables and lots of potatoes here on the side. It is going to be lovely. I'd like to know what the white stuff is. This is the kind of restaurant where you come to fight off a hangover by eating Haejeongguk. In our case, if you're freezing you come for a hearty stew like this one. Bubbling goodness. What are you eating over there? I'm just taking the meat off of the pork spine. How is the meat? Is it tasty? Oh, yes. Okay, it is time to dish it up. It is all cooked. You can see that the broth is a real thick and hearty looking with the different sesame seeds and all kinds of different paste. Gamjatang soup basically means that it has potatoes but there is also lots of other things in there. We have pork spine, there are some rice cakes, sesame leaves, sesame seeds, mushrooms and there was a white paste which we haven't really figured out what it was. We think it might be a sesame based paste. How would you describe the broth? It is a lot spicier than I was expecting but it is very flavorful. It is really good. Let's get a close-up shot. With the gamjatang you really have to make sure to stir it around so that it doesn't stick to the bottom. We kind of made that mistake earlier. I'll just add to the flavor. This is the meat after it has been de-boned. I like to dip it in the mustard sauce - it is really spicy and it almost reminds me of wasabi a little but with a mustard-y flavor. It definitely does have a bite and a little bit of a tang to it. Show us how it is done. Let's grab a little bit. That looks fatty. Here is a normal piece - that one. Here you go. You can just dip it and swirl it around. Delicious! We're almost finished the meal and what is left is basically just a thick collection of stew, meat and a few random potatoes and veggies. As you can see here our feast is complete. The cost of this meal was 25,000 Won - roughly 25 USD - a little bit less. Overall, our feeling was that although it was tasty and definitely delicious relatively compared to what we can get at other Korean restaurants it was a little bit expensive. We probably won't try this one again. Today's Valentines Day in Korea and instead of stuffing ourselves with copious amounts of chocolate we've decided to come and have a Korean traditional set lunch. So Korea has a lot of lovey dovey holidays for couples and we've actually managed to miss most of them, so there was kiss day in June I believe and hug day in December and we were unaware of these, so we've got to make up and celebrate Valentines Day this year. So by Korean set meal, what it is called locally is Hanjeongsik, and what that means is basically it's a set meal built around rice dishes (such as the dolsot stone pot rice set). What we expect to have is a lot of different side dishes and soups, so it's going to be a really big meal. Mmmm....I'm starving so I'm looking forward to this. Yes, me too. First off, they brought us juk, which is kind of like a soup, so take a look in here. And this black. I wonder what it is made of? Good question. I'll take a sip and let you know. Any guesses? I have no idea. Hahahaha! Is it good though? No, it's good - it's really nice. Oh, and there is jeon too. Little jeon. Gamhasamnida. Neh Background music So our feast has arrived. It's a pleasant surprise. We really didn't know what we were going to get, so we'll give you a bit of a tour here. Over here we've got something called Bulgogi, which is marinated beef strips. Down here it looks like we've got a normal salad. Jeon, which is a Korean style pancake, which we both love. This looks like a sort of mini kind of Tonkatsu, mini cutlet and another kind of salad and chapchae. We've just been brought one more dish here, which is called Bosam, a kind of steamed meat. So the Bulgogi is finished cooking now we're going to dish it up. Let's get some veggies in there too. And the Bulgogi is known for having a sweet sauce. What it is being marinated in is actually quite a sweet sauce. How does that look? That looks awesome. It's steamed up. Time to try it. MMm...it's awesome. The meat is really tender. Really nice....soft....MMMMMM. What do you got there? This is the most delicious Pa Jeon I've had since I've been in Korea. Korean pancake? It's a little Korean pancake with lots of green onions and this one also has seafood. It looks like octopus maybe. And it's so good. Very crispy isn't it? MMMMMMhmmmm. Flavorful? There are so many side dishes to choose from that it's a little difficult to decide what you're going to eat next. Music playing in the background. So I really thought the meal was over after the first set of dishes came out but behold there is even more to eat. All kinds of goodness ranging from fish to soup and here is the dolsot, the stone pot, rice. What we're going to be doing right now is we're actually going to be scooping out the rice from the stone pot and then adding water to burnt sides of it. And what that does is it creates a rice soup. So Audrey is scooping it out. So at this point we scraped out all of the rice from the main part. As you can see we've put it in the bowl and now we've just got the rice on the side. We're going to add some hot water and turn it into a soup. Sizzling water boiling sound. Cover it up. And we wait. Water boiling sound. Steaming Looks like we've put a little bit too much water in here. It's actually bubbling over. That's my rice just bubbling next to me on the table. So here is my whole fish. I'm just trying to get some meat off the bone, so I have to take out the spine. It's kind of difficult. A morcel. It is time for the official unveiling of the stone pot. Da da dun da dun. So now we have a little rice soup. It's kind of a murky looking soup. Audrey will try it. Hopefully not burn myself. It does look very hot. Mmmmm, it's very sweet. Is it sweet? It's like a sweet tea with rice in it. It was a great meal. I'm personally stuffed. And there are still so many dishes I never got around to trying. It was just very very filling. So much food. Would you come back again? I would definitely come back here. Definitely feel the same way as Audrey. one of the better value meals I've had in a long time. It's just awesome. Eating noises Tonight for dinner we're going to show you one of our favorite Korean meals. It's actually Korean Chinese food. In every country Chinese food is a little bit different and Korea is no exception. This here is a typical Korean-Chinese restaurant. It's just a small little place. Hahaha! We have someone who is very hungry. So the last time we had Chinese food it was in Busan on our first trip together. And Sam ate so much that one night that he couldn't even walk afterwards and we ended up not even seeing the markets, not seeing the city. It was straight to bed for him. What you talking about! Actually, sadly it's true. Gamsahamnida! Yum Yum check this out. It's for one person. That's like a feast in a bowl. What is it? That's Jjajamyeong. Which is? It's noodles with a black bean paste and some onions. And this is an actual set we ordered. We got this whole massive feast. Like these are huge bowls. And we got sweet and sour pork. Now this is a value meal. For the two of us $13. Yeah! I'm already digging in. You are. Slurping noises. Stirring noises Eating noises Well, that's a long noodle! It sure is. Oh, it's so good. One of our favorite foods to have. So here we have this sweet and sour pork. It's breaded and deep fried and it's in a nice sweet sauce. And we also have a few veggies like onions, carrots and maybe coleslaw. Mmm....nice little surprise there. that's really good. It's quite sweet isn't it? MMMMM>...yeah In a Chinese Korean restaurant often the best value meals are the sets. We ordered what was Set A which included the two bowls of Jjajamyeong here and the Tongsuyuk the sweet and sour pork. This meal will leave us stuffed. We can't even finish it all. Oh yeah, that's going to fill us up for sure. Eating noises Stirring noises What are you doing? Just mixing in the black bean paste. Then I'm going to stuff my face. Eating noises. Hahahaha...You got enough? As usual in a Korean - Chinese restaurant you don't really get that many side dishes. We just have these lovely little radishes. That's the banchan. That's the Korean side dish. We've got so much to eat leftover. Well, I couldn't quite finish mine. It was just too much food. Sam did a little bit better. There is nothing left of mine. A true pig. But anyways, for someone visiting Korea and looking for a cheap budget meal that is delicious we recommend Korean-Chinese food. It's awesome! For lunch today we're having one of my favorite foods in all of Korea - Hamuel Pa Jeon. Jeon is a kind of Korean pancake. It's actually the very first meal I ever had when I came to Seoul many years ago, so this is an old familiar favorite. So this is the kind of meal that you eat as an appetizer before a really big feast or you can have it as an anju, which means you eat it as a side dish when you're having drinks. Background noise in the restaurant. So it appears we've got some kind of a rice tea or drink before our meals comes. We're just dishing it up. Let's see what it tastes like. Are you going to take a sip? Yeah, it's a kind of refreshing hot rice drink. Hot rice tea. Background noise in the restaurant. Music playing in the background. So it looks like we have a little soup here with some soy beans and healthy greens. Let's get some broth in here. So in my hands here is something called Makeoli. It's a Korean rice wine and it is something that can be made with both rice and wheat. Fermented rice and wheat. It is traditionally a popular drink with Korean farmers but now everyone loves it. So it comes in these cute little bowls. I'm going to show you what it pours like. It kind of has a white murky milky substance and it is the perfect drink pairing for what we've order - the Korean pizza - Pa jeon. They go together. So Makgeoli isn't too strong. It's typically 6 to 8 percent alcohol, so it's a nice social drink where you can have several cups. They've rolled the kimchi up nice and neat and cute. In fact, I think it's almost too cute to eat. Can you imagine? Kimchi too cute to eat? Okay, so here is. Cheers. Gumbai as they say in Korea. That's nice. Is it nice? Yeah, it is. Okay, time for a Korean cheers. Gumbai. Oh wow, that's massive. Gamsahamnida. Speaking in Korean Here is our Pa Jeon and it is a generous looking size. It's massive. We've got the tongs and the sissors to cut it up. You have expert hands. Background music playing. So it's just been lovingly cut up into nice little bite sized bits. And we are going to try it. Yes, I am. Once I'm able to pick it up. I'm going to dip it into the sauce, which is soy sauce. I know I'm not supposed to be using my hands but I want to make this happen. There we go. Mmmmmm That sauce is good. So Pa Jeon is the perfect meal to enjoy with a friend. It's often typically eaten during bad weather days. For example when it is raining or when I'm hiking together. It's a very social meal. If you look down here you can see the Pa is actually the green onion, the scallions. This here is what is called the Pa and because we have seafood and other objects like this. This is actually Hamul Pa Jeon. This is shrimp. There is a whole bunch of different vegetables and seafood. It's made with a salty pancake like dough. Are you feeling a little buzzed from the Makgeoli? No, I've hardly had any. Okay, what is your verdict for this meal? I really like it. I thought it was a great jeon. It was very tasty, the seafood was pretty fresh. Do you want to know when something has turned out to be a good meal? What? When you look down and there is not even a morsel left. I'll take the last one. There you go. Hahahaha. Some happy customers. Well, I love this meal. We took care of the Pa jeon here completely. And I probably knocked off 85 percent of the Magkeoli. I've got a nice little buzz going on right now. Oh yeah! I'm in a happy place. Today we are visiting the Shin Old Tea House where we will be enjoying a cup of traditional tea. Right now we find ourselves in a very cozy little tea house. It is very cute. They have low dim lighting and tapestries and pillows on the ground, so we've ordered ourselves some nice fruity teas. This tea house is located just off of Insadong, which is known as sort of the cultural hub street of Seoul. We've found this quaint little place. As we've placed our orders we have some delicious looking snacks. This looks like rice cake and maybe another rice cake covered in honey with little cereal chunks on top maybe. Let's try this. Crunchy huh? Okay. It is like puffed rice - like rice popcorn maybe. It has like honey on the outside and it is very sweet and airy. Here is the ginger tea and the masilcha is the plum tea. How is the plum tea? It is delicious. Mine is so sweet it is almost like liquid honey but it is not too overwhelming. It is really nice. There is plenty of flavor aside from it being sweet. What kind of tea did you get over there? I got ginger tea. The same thing - it is a nice sweet tea with a really strong ginger flavor. It is just a perfect way to warm-up on a winter day. Oh, yeah. I'm going to try one of these now. It is a rice cake with a green swirl in it. I'm not sure what the green swirl is because I can't taste any difference. Is it kind of plain tasting? It is just a regular rice cake. We're receiving heat from two different sources - an electric fan up above us and then we also have the ondul system on the floor. The heated floors by the heated pipes underneath. We're as toasty as you can get. I feel like I could take a nap in here. I probably could too. Getting off of Insadong's main strip is a really good idea because it is usually in the back alleys where you can find traditional restaurants, traditional tea houses and just quieter places. It is much better value and also has traditional homes as well which is the same as here. We are finished sadly our tea is gone. It is time to wrap things up and head back into Insadong for a little shopping and maybe some cake. Tonight we're going to be trying a new dish here at our favorite restaurant. It is going to be our last time to eat here because I'm finishing my teaching contract and going back to Canada soon. Anyways, we're going to be trying the signature dish of this restaurant and it is called Dtalktoritang which is spicy chicken vegetable stew. I've had this before and it is delicious. We've always come here and had our Dolsot bibimbap and sundubu jjigae because we've loved it but this actually the signature dish at this restaurant and we're going to be eating it tonight. Yummy! How hungry are you? I'm hungry yeah! Hungry! Yeah! Let's see your hungry face? I'm hungry! My hungry lion face? Rawr. Come on - I'm hungry! Gamsahamnida (thank you in Korean). There comes the stew. Here is our hearty chicken stew and it is the perfect winter dish and it has got lots of pieces of chicken, potatoes, onions, vegetables and it looks really tasty and really filling. It is bubbly bubbly bubbly. Let's dig in! We have a nice piece of chicken breast over here. I'm loading up myself. Lots of potatoes and lots of chicken. This is the perfect dish now that the temperatures have dropped below zero. It is just so filling and it gets you feeling all warm. The potatoes are nice and soft and the chicken has been boiling for a while so it is very tender. It falls right off the bone. Yes, it is one of my favorite Korean dishes so far. I wish I had discovered it sooner. Too bad. Tell us your thoughts? How much are you loving this dish? I'm loving but I think you're loving it even more. One of the interesting things about this dish is that there are several different parts to the chicken here. There are drumsticks and various parts without bones. There is some work involved while eating. This is the bone section. Dtalkdoritang is what this dish is called and I'll break down the words we used. Dalktorri - tang means stew. You can imagine this as chicken stew. I have a feeling it might be chicken mixed stew or chicken spicy stew. It also has potatoes and onions and different things in it. It is steaming as you speak. This dish comes in a several different sizes. The one we got here is actually a small. If you take a look at it it is not small. That's a lot meat boiling there. It's a lot of meat and potatoes for two people. It also comes in medium and large size, so this dish we're ordering here is 19,000 Korean Won which is 17-18 USD these days. All of this for that price is really reasonable. The medium is 24,000 Won and the large is 29,000 Won. I'm guessing the large could feed an entire family and maybe even an entire extended family. It is just a lot of food and we're enjoying it. We polished off the stew. This is what is left of it and this actually the best part. The broth got really thick and it is flavorful and saucy. You like your saucy foods don't you? What a feast. What a great way to end my time in Korea. And I think you have a little sauce on your lips in the corner of your mouth a bit. No? Korean barbecue time! Surprise, surprise we're back at our favorite barbecue. Tonight we're having So-Galbi. The difference being we're having beef instead of pork. This cut of beef is so much better. It is not nearly as fatty. It is going to be delicious. Unlike the Samgyeopsal, this galbi is coated in a sweet sauce. Check it out. This being the sauce. One of our favorite aspects of this meal is that it is a do it yourself barbecue. We are preparing it for ourselves. I am loving this meat. It is very soft and juicy and I've gotten used to eating very fatty meats here in Korea. This is like gold. What are you putting in it now? I'm putting it in the ssamjang sauce. Let's see your yummy face? I'm having a yummy good time. If you want to eat the meat like a Korean I'm going to show you how. You've got the lettuce in one hand and you've got the meat and chopsticks. Follow me. First you're going to dip it into the soy sauce and then a little bit into the ssamjang - red pepper paste and a little soy bean paste. Plop that into the lettuce. I'm going to get some leafy springs and put those in. We would normally have garlic but we weren't given any today, so this is going to be good enough. We just forgot to cook it. I have all of the garlic. Oh you do - over there. Roll it into a ball pop it in your mouth. We finished cooking all of the meat so now we're just grilling the onions and the garlic a little bit. We take the meat off of the grill because otherwise it just totally burns. This is about perfect. This is about as close as you can get to a caveman diet. The so called cave-man diet. It is just basically meat, veggies and a bit of soup. There are really no carbs here at all. This is the kyeran jjim - it is like an egg souffle. Beef and not smoke. Bloopers! The difference being...haha La la la Happy Saturday! Yeah! We're going to our favorite Korean restaurant in my area. And it's just a little hole in the wall place. We're going to show you what it is all about. Yes, and this is a place we visit very often almost every single weekend. The food is amazing. Amazing and cheap. Yep. That's why we like it. Ok, show us the way. Come in. Come in. So this is the basement. We have to go downstairs. Steps. We're going right by a butcher shop here. And here it is. Our favorite place. I'm not sure if it has a name. Can An Sik Dang. So this is a Korean sit-down restaurant, so we get some pillows and here is our complimentary tea. Oooh! And you can see it is a traditional table. I like this restaurant because first we get so many side dishes. The service is pretty fast and it doesn't take too long for her to cook the food. It's better than fast food in Korea. Yes! Which is actually slow. So now it is your turn. Tell us why do you like this restaurant so much? Well, I love it because it's a typical hole in the wall Korean style place. These always tend to be the best restaurants in this country. The places in the basement are places that aren't chain restaurants. It's got a bit of character to it. Oppa Gangnam style! Hey sexy Audrey! Dooo Dooo Dooo Dooo Silly dancing style Korean tv playing Ooooh! You're really into your Korean soap operas. What's going to happen next? Gamsahamnida So this is just the side dishes. It's not even the main course. Gamsahamnida Here is our Korean feast. We're having our two favorites. We're having Dolsot Bibimbap, which is the mixed Korean rice. You can look at that. All the veggies, all of the yumminess. Soon Dubu Jjiggae. Soft tofu spicy soup. It's spicy too! Sam is stirring the dolsot bibimbap. Cooking noises and this is what it looks like when it is done. It's hot. Is it hot? And action. How is it? Bubaaaabuhhhh bibimbap. It's good. And our Korean feast which we nearly devoured only cost us just over $10 USD. Not so bad. Good value. Full belly means a happy boy. My happy dance...Wooooo! That's not going to work. And that was lunch at our favourite place. Yeah! Blah, blah, blah, blah Gamsamnida (Thank you in Korean). Basically what shabu-shabu is a kind of hot pot Korean style hot pot. What we do is we have different ingredients here. Thin slices of beef putting in, greens, different vegetables here already in the pot and we've got noodles at one point and over here this is what we're going to be putting in to make the rice at the very end. It's a lot of different courses to this meal. Basically, eventually we're going to get all of these different ingredients and meat into here and it is a spicy type of hot pot. It's perfect for the winter season. We're going to put some of the vegetables in the soup right now. Snip snip. All the leafy goodness. That looks tasty. One of our favorite aspects of these communal Korean meals is the do it yourself part. We're cooking a bit of the meal here. Next up is the meat. Plop it right into the pot and it cooks very fast. That is why you don't want to put it in at first. It's good to cook to the vegetables first because of that reason. Apparently, the name Shabu-shabu is derived from an onomatopoeia meaning that the Shabu Shabu sound is supposed to indicate the swishing sound of the beef cooking in the hot pot sauce. Shabu shabu! Shabu-shabu! Bubbly bubbly bubbly bubbly! Now it is noodle time. Oh my gosh okay! There we go. Disaster averted. Yeah. That makes it a lot more thick with the noodles. I'm really enjoying the meal so far and my favorite part is the thin strips of beef and you can dip that in a wasabi and soy sauce mixture and it is really strong and really potent. It has made my eyes water a couple of times. Let's see you do the demo. Let's see a demo here. I'm not sure there is any beef left. I've devoured most of it. Dip it into the wasabi. Let's soak it and the camera is all fogged up now. Here I am with the thin strip of beef and I'm going to be dunking it into the soy sauce wasabi combo. Absolutely delicious. Mashiketa (delicious in Korean). A Korean lady is over there making our bokumbap - our fried rice - and she is using some of the leftover ingredients from the Shabu-shabu as well as mixing it into the pot. Here comes our fried-rice bokumbap. Look at that! The best part is that if you leave it for a while it gets crispy on the bottom, so you get a nice crispy golden rice. Hold on - it is really hot! Tasty? Oh yeah. This meal cost Man Gu Cheon Won which is 19,000 Won which is less than 19 USD. It's a pretty good price. It is the meal that keeps on giving. You get the soup, the vegetables, the beef, the noodles and the rice at the end. You also get complementary coffee. What is not to like? It's a lot of food for free.",False,20140519 - KOREAN CUISINE GUIDE ≡ƒì£≡ƒìÜ [An introduction to Korean Food in South Korea ≡ƒç░≡ƒç╖].en.srt

I'm hungry. Rawr! Today we are having Budae Jjigae. Budae Jjigae is not Korean traditional food. It was invented after the Korean war when American food (like spam and hotdogs) were very abundant. Apparently, it originated from an area we've been to before, Songtan. The ingredients in Budae Jjigae are often similar to what would be in other Korean stews. The main difference being that things such as spam and hotdogs, which you can see Audrey moving around here (and she stopped) were found around the American bases. There is also a kind of fusion stew, so there can be any kind of different ingredients thrown in. Sometimes you'll find noodles are put in. There is a lot of different things and it is getting steamy. Considering it has spam it is quite tasty. It is light and just a little bit spicy. As with all Korean meals this comes with rice, kimchi and other side dishes. Delicious (in Korean). Thank you (in Korean). This is the perfect food for us today since we're both a little bit sick. I've had a cold for two weeks. Booh! The Korean traditional porridge, also known as Juk, is considered a very healthy meal and it is often eaten when someone has digestive issues or a cold or something like that. This hobakjuk, this pumpkin juk is something that I love and I've had many times but this is going to be Audrey's first time. It is very thick. Let's get a shot of you doing this. The first bite! Does it taste good? Yeah, it is like rice-y and pumpkin-y at the same time. It is kind of sweet. Nice. So the hobakjuk, the pumpkin juk (pumpkin porridge) is made with glutinous rice, so it is very thick. As you can see there are big rice ball chunks. Yummy! I'm just dishing it up. I'm having the massive rice ball here. It is extremely chewy. Apparently, on a Korean game show many years ago someone actually choked on one of these. That's pretty awful, so I'm going to chew mine well. The pumpkin porridge is considered slow food which is a buzz word in Korea. Oh, well being. Lots of bloopers here. Yes, oh there is plenty. Rawr! Today we are having Korean hangover soup because Sam is hungover. Haejangguk, is what you could consider as hearty stew. It has the beef rib, the galbi rib okay. It also has various kinds of vegetables and glass noodles. It's a very ummmm nutritious meal obviously to cure the hangover. In Korea the soup is Haejangguk. These restaurants tend to be open 24 hours because in Korea people like to drink all the time just like me. Snipping noises. So now you basically have to pick the meat off of it. So we're picking the meat off of here using chopsticks. Chopsticks and the tongs. And how is it? It's very peppery but it's really good. Ohh...haha One of my favorite parts are the glass noodles at the very bottom. They're very slippery. Very tasty. It comes with various side dishes such as pickled radish, kimchi, and a spicy dipping sauce called Ssamjjang. And it also comes with rice. So this is a big hunk of meat. Ooh lala. There are also a few little rice cakes at the bottom as well. And they're very tasty. These here and the disgarded bones we've emptied into the bowl. We are at a Korean restaurant right now and we're going to be cooking our own barbecue. We will be grilling our own meat here at the table and it is a very tasty meal, so I'm excited to be eating it once it all gets here. How are you doing dear? Can you flip them? Just struggling a little bit. Nice skills with the chopsticks. Nice, nice skills. This is a very Korean thing. They usually bring you a pair of scissors to cut your meat instead of slicing it for you. They let you play chef at the table. It is almost like doing surgery here. Little snippets of meat being put onto the table. Now we just finished cutting up all of the pieces of meat and we're just cooking them a little bit longer. We want them nice and crispy. They have a lot of fat so I am trying to melt some of that away. This is going to be one delicious bite. Samgyeopsal and Ssamjang. Tasty! How does it taste? It tastes great. Okay, I am going to show how we have this delicious Korean barbecue the Korean style way. First, what we do is we grab a nice piece of leafy lettuce here and then we take a piece of the samgyeopsal (which is meat) and we dip it into this red sauce just like this pop it onto the lettuce, grab some springs and put those on and a piece of garlic. That looks delicious. It is going to be good. Then what you do is roll it into a bite sized shape - just like this - and some people take several bites but you know how I eat I am going to pop it all in. Is it ever good. Oh, I'm so full but it was so good. Okay, we just finished our meal and I am stuffed. I ate most of the garlic when Sam wasn't looking, so watch out. I knew I didn't get much. It was a very filling meal. I have no room for dessert. That is it. I'm hungry! I am hungry and this is my hungry face. I'm going to devour food. Today we're having a special Korean meal called Bulgogi which literally translates as fire meat. Paygo Pa In Korean Paego Payo means I am hungry and that is exactly how I'm feeling now. I'm hungry! In Korea the youngest person at the table is supposed to pour the drinks for their elders. Respect your elders! RESPECT! We are now cooking the Bulgogi and the Pulgogi is marinated beef strips in a lovely sauce. So Audrey here is stirring the Bulgogi and it is near the final stages of being cooked and the meat is really starting to look done here. I'm going to do a little demonstration on how to eat Bulgogi. So you grab a lettuce leaf and then you take some meat and plop it in there and you put some of this sauce (the samjjang). What else can we add? Maybe a little seaweed. Sure, you can add whatever you want. And then what do you do? Then we just roll it all up into a little ball and stuff it. Is it good? You look like you're almost choking on it. We are about to lift this stone pot rice lid. Look at that steam! So this lunch is a special meal that is called Cheonsik and in Korean Cheonsik means set course meal. That is why we have a lot more side dishes than usual. We have a special kind of rice today and it is purple in color and it has some kind of beans and also a nice looking date. Special times! These are our lovely side dishes. Let's start over here. So we have the tofu which is called dubu in Korean and it is all dressed up. This looks like some kind of raw meat and we're not sure what it is so we haven't touched it. Oh, it is octopus! I see the tentacles. Look on this side. Yummy. Are you going to try that? This one is our favorite is it not? What is one of the ingredients? This is pumpkin and potatoes. Yeah, kind of like a pumpkin potato salad. It is similar to a potato salad in western culture. This Bulgogi meat is very popular in Korea because it has a sweet flavor to it and it is also really popular in McDonald's and Lotteria because they use it to make burgers. The rice has been sitting in the stone pot for a while and now it is really crispy. Actually I can't even show you. This is a traditional table...no! Yes! So right here we have the Bulgogi. Places such as Lotteria...that is bad. We are having pizza tonight. And, you know what, as much as I love all the Korean food in my neighborhood - and there are some awesome stuff - and even beyond Korean food (there is Japanese food, Chinese food and all kinds of food) but when it comes to my personal favorite nothing beats a good pizza. I am super lucky that I found a place that serves up great pizza. I mean just take a look at this - it is loaded with toppings. This is the combination pizza. It has got cheese - it has got everything. All dressed and all loaded. We are just going to scarf that down something fierce. Are you ready to eat? Yes. Delicious right? That looks pretty big baby. Tasty? Look at you. Oh, the pizza looks so good. Gooey gooey cheese. Today we are eating our dinner out in the parking lot. We did try a few restaurants in the area but they were all closed on Sunday night. We figured let's get some pizza from our favorite place and enjoy it outdoors. It is nice and breezy isn't it? It is very nice. I'm enjoying it. Usually in the evening you see that more people come out to drink their beers or soju so it will get a lot busier. It will be hopping by the time we leave. Tonight we're having the quintessential Korean feast - it is fried glazed chicken with a massive jug of beer. You wouldn't think that fried chicken is a very Korean dish but it is super popular. In my neighborhood alone, we have more than five chicken places. There are tonnes in my area too in Pyeongtaek. This is a typical Korean anju - side dish. Although it tastes like basically nothing it is addictive. You can't stop popping it in your mouth. And that there in front of us is three liters of beer. Do you think we've got enough for tonight? This was not my idea okay? Gumbae! Our last two weeks in Korea and we're going to toast to an excellent time here and backpacking adventures in Malaysia. That is so much beer. Tell us about beer. Well, in Korea there are four major beers. There is the one we're having now - Cass. There is one called OB, Cafri and Hite. There is the chicken. Look what we've got there. Our food has arrived. It looks like a deep-fried pop corn chicken with perhaps sweet and sour sauce. A sweet and sour glaze. It looks good right? I have to admit that I love this chicken. It is crispy on the outside and it is sweet and just melts right in your mouth. This Korean feast here, of chicken and beer, came to 27,000 Won which is twenty-seven USD dollars roughly - a little bit less than that. We got a whole lot of beer and a decent amount of chicken. There is far more beer than there is chicken, so in order for me to earn a bite of chicken, I'm forcing myself to nearly drink a whole cup of beer. Otherwise, the chicken would be all done and we'd just be left with beer. What are the biggest cities in Korea? Name some of the biggest cities in Korea. The biggest cities in Korea - Seoul, Busan, Gwangju, Suwon, Incheon. Another city that is in between Pusan and Daejeon. Daegu! Okay, try and say something very poetic and Korean. Poetic? I'm just going to teach you Korean bar etiquette here okay. Say you've depleted your anju. If you want more you call the waiter over and you say 'Yogiyo' and then you ask them 'Doh Juseyo' which means fill it up. I'd like some more. Okay? What else can you say? That is pretty good. Alright, so say you're eating our meal like this, which is delicious. Show us how. And you really like it - you can say 'Mashiseoyo' or if you want to add emphasis you can 'Neomu Mashiseoyo' or 'Cheongmal Mashiseoyo' that means it is very delicious. Nice! Sam keeps saying no more chicken until you drink beer. No more chicken! Well, just watch. Hahaha! This is my chicken. This is the final beer update. Look, we completely depleted this jug here. I've drank about 85% of this. This is the last glass I have. Overall, it was a great night of chicken and beer in Korea. Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Done. It is Saturday morning and normally on a weekend I would expect to wake-up late and maybe have some waffles or pancakes for breakfast but instead I've been dragged out of my apartment way too early to eat Ox Bone soup. In the cold! I'm on? Woo! One of the nicest things about this restaurant here is that it has the heated floors, which in Korean is called Ondul. We were walking around in the subzero temperatures and now we're warming up our butts on the ground. What has arrived at our table is called Seolleongtang and it is an ox bone soup with brisket. This is what it looks like - it has got kind of a murky white color. I'm going to stir it. This is instant noodles and here is the brisket. This soup comes with rice as you can see and we also have some veggies and kimchi that we can supposedly add to our soup. Kimchi in a jar. I think this is what we add to our soup - all kinds of onions. Oh, more of the radish kimchi. She is chopping up the kimchi. That is how it is done. Doesn't that look good? It sure does. Is it time for the first bite? Okay, let's try the broth first. I can not say it is very flavorful. It is like water. Yeah? Let's add more things to it. Okay. We've just grabbed the salt - hopefully this will make the soup a little less bland. Let's add a little. Do you want to add some more. Alright, let's give this a stir. Try a bit with the broth. Experimenting here. That is better but it needs more. Lots more! We've found even more seasonings here. We've got some pepper in an attempt to really spice things up a little and to add a little zest. Let's stir it. Let's try that now. It is much better - okay good. I am trying the brisket here. How does it taste? It is nice and tender. It is a real 'nice' cut of meat and not fatty at all. After doing a little bit of research on this dish, on wikipedia, I read that often rice can be added into the Seolleongtang, so that is exactly what I'm going to do. I'm going to take my bowl of rice and plop it right in. That is definitely going to thicken things up here. Let's try that. Not too bad. Audrey is going to try the noodles. How are those? They are really tender and really soft. Are they soft? Yes. The verdict: I can't say I would eat this soup again. I really wanted to like it but it is just too bland. It is white rice and plain noodles and a white murky broth. There is no spice, so I prefer the Hajeonguk or the Dtalktoritang. I am sad. Or the sundubu jjigae. Yes. Okay, so what did you think of the soup? Well, I have to agree with you on this. It wasn't my favorite. I did finish it but I do like so many Korean spicy and flavorful soups. One of the ones love are some of the ones you mentioned but also sundubu jjigae, kimchi jjigae and so many others. It just didn't quite hit the spot but it was okay. Today we are at a Japanese restaurant and it is the kind of restaurant where the food just revolves around and you pick what you want. Let's see what we find. Sushi! Alright, so everything is completely self-serve. The different color plates mean different prices. I'm a huge fan of salmon so I will be eating a lot of the salmon today. I chose the grilled salmon here so I'm going to take a bit of this and see. That looks like a happy customer. I am happy. Here we have the menu of all different sushi you can get. Is that plural? Different kinds of sushi - that'll work. They are all different prices. There is a huge list, so it is basically you go here and you eat as much as you want and afterwards they stack up your plates and you get a bill. It is time for me to try the salmon here. You look like you're really enjoying that. That is so good. This totally reminds me of when I grew up. I grew up on Vancouver Island, Canada where I had smoked salmon all the time. My Dad would be smoking salmon in the summer and this totally reminds me of home. I love it. Time to put it in my mouth. How is the raw salmon? It is really good. There is my hot tea. That looks like water honestly. I don't even know what this is. It is supposed to be green tea but maybe not. What are you doing here. I'm making myself some green tea here. In Korean that is nokcha. I'm adding some green powder. We already have hot water here and I will swirl it with a chopstick I guess. It certainly looks green. Yeah, that is some nice green tea. Alright, so six stacked plates. That is all of the sushi we ate. That is close to eighteen dollars. We are in the kitchen in my little apartment and today happens to be Seollal, the Solar - Lunar New Year - in Korea. A lot of the places have shut down in the neighborhood. A lot of the restaurants are closed, so we will be cooking in my kitchen. Look at what we have here - this is called Gunmandu. It is going to be pan-fried mandu and these are going to be yummy. There are many kinds of different Korean mandu. Mandu, being Korean dumplings - the ones we are having here are typically actually found in Chinese Korean restaurants which are pan friend mandu and they are really golden and crispy on the outside. There are a whole bunch of other different mandu - steamed mandu and there is what is called Wang mandu which are huge mandu. Today we're having the pan friend mandu and it is cooking right now with a bit of oil. Here we have the gun mandu and they are getting nice and crispy and you can see a little bit of golden brown. It is just the way we like them. They're almost ready to eat. During the Korean holiday of Seollal it is actually one of the two biggest holidays of the year - the other one being Chuseok, which is roughly around late September and early October. This one is typically in February. The deal with this holiday is almost everything in the city, not just here in Yongin, but in Seoul and everywhere else - everything shuts down and families get together cooking traditional Korean foods. What is cooking there? We've got something called chapchae. And chapchae literally means 'mixed vegetables': chap is mixed and chae means vegetables. It is Korean for vegetables. We are making mixed vegetables and if you look down here the main ingredient is sweet potato glass noodles and when they are finished cooking they look almost transparent. We've got a whole variety of different seasonal vegetables here - mushrooms, various kinds of peppers. It looks good. This is it. This is our Korean style chapchae. I'm going to grab some veggies along with the potato glass noodles. Oh, it is stringy. How does it taste? Oh, it is good. There it is. It is still steaming and we have the mandu over here. The interesting thing about a Korean meal and we're eating it Korean style is that all of the food is on one dish and then the other dishes are separate ones. In other words, you don't take half and put half and half. We just share. Everyone picks at it with chopsticks. Exactly, you pick out at it right from the main dish. Audrey is going to try the gunmandu. Let's see how this turned out. Tasty? That is really good. Yeah? It is nice and crispy. You can see the noodles inside. Let's take a look. Wowzers - that looks good.",False,20140511 - Korean Food ∩╝Ü An introduction to Korean Cuisine For First Time Visitors To South Korea.en.srt

It's the cultural HUB of Seoul and we've come here to buy some souvenirs to take back home. Since it's our last weekend in Korea! Background music More background music Children laughing I'm ready for my free hug. You go claim your free hug. Hahahaha Audrey's ready for her free hug Hahaha...thank you If you're looking to try Korean street food Insadong is one of your best bets in the entire country, let alone Seoul. Korean men chanting and speaking Background music playing More music playing So we have some really cute Korean socks. I think I'm going to get the couples pair. We could get once of these. Background music More background music So what are we waiting for? We are waiting to get our couple caricature drawn and hopefully we'll be wearing traditional Korean dresses. It's caricature unveiling time. The big reveal. Ta-Dah! That's us. Awesome huh? Hahaha...yes Today we're going to visit one of our favorite places, the cat cafe. MEOW! This one is in Hongdae. Yes it is. It's a great place too. Cats making noises. Well someone is sure popular. I am. What are you feeding them? I'm giving them some chicken breast. Owe! Feed me now! It's got sharp teeth. Owe They're like hurry up, I'll take it from you. So today we're at one of our favorite places in Seoul, it's called the Cat Cafe. It's located in Hongdae which is a popular university area. And what the deal is about this place is you come here, you pay for your drinks and then you get the opportunity to roam around and pet with a whole bunch of different cats. As you can see there is one sleeping right against my jacket. Oh, that's cute. Cute kitty! And this little one was sleeping a second ago. Prrrr! And here is a cute little kitty in a box. It's wearing a little taekwondo outfit. Music playing He who has the chicken bits is the popular one. This is Sam in his element playing with all of the cats. So popular! Hello beautiful. One of the reasons I really like this place is because of the cat to person ratio. There is a lot of cats and just a few people. I like this place because it is really easy to find cats affection. Even if you just go to the counter and get some chicken or beef jerky. And in an instant voila best friend. You're surrounded by like 10 cats, so it's great. And here is a wall of the different kitties you can meet. They all have names and background information. Your face is hilarious! I'm feeding a lion here! And there is some kitties hanging out up top here. Hello! We're going to go try to feed the kitty that is up top. Let's see if it wakes him up. There we go. Hungry fella! Kicking and rolling sound of the ball. This one is pre-occupied with my bag. What are you looking for? This one looks like my cat Tommy back home. Let's get a close up. Tommy? Hey Tommy! This one has been here the whole time and now it is curled up and sleeping. Today we're back at the cat cafe and as you can see. Oh no! Hahahahaha! There is a fight. Oh my gosh! And what are we doing at the cat cafe? Feeding them when they are not fighting. Hahahaha! That's awesome. Meow. Behave! Behave little kitties. That's so mean. The other one was nice. I'm going to go feed him. We were just given some cat food on our hands and now my job is to get this off. How does my hair look? Marvelous! Today we are visiting the Shin Old Tea House where we will be enjoying a cup of traditional tea. Right now we find ourselves in a very cozy little tea house. It is very cute. They have low dim lighting and tapestries and pillows on the ground, so we've ordered ourselves some nice fruity teas. This tea house is located just off of Insadong, which is known as sort of the cultural hub street of Seoul. We've found this quaint little place. As we've placed our orders we have some delicious looking snacks. This looks like rice cake and maybe another rice cake covered in honey with little cereal chunks on top maybe. Let's try this. Crunchy huh? Okay. It is like puffed rice - like rice popcorn maybe. It has like honey on the outside and it is very sweet and airy. Here is the ginger tea and the masilcha is the plum tea. How is the plum tea? It is delicious. Mine is so sweet it is almost like liquid honey but it is not too overwhelming. It is really nice. There is plenty of flavor aside from it being sweet. What kind of tea did you get over there? I got ginger tea. The same thing - it is a nice sweet tea with a really strong ginger flavor. It is just a perfect way to warm-up on a winter day. Oh, yeah. I'm going to try one of these now. It is a rice cake with a green swirl in it. I'm not sure what the green swirl is because I can't taste any difference. Is it kind of plain tasting? It is just a regular rice cake. We're receiving heat from two different sources - an electric fan up above us and then we also have the ondul system on the floor. The heated floors by the heated pipes underneath. We're as toasty as you can get. I feel like I could take a nap in here. I probably could too. Getting off of Insadong's main strip is a really good idea because it is usually in the back alleys where you can find traditional restaurants, traditional tea houses and just quieter places. It is much better value and also has traditional homes as well which is the same as here. We are finished sadly our tea is gone. It is time to wrap things up and head back into Insadong for a little shopping and maybe some cake. We are visiting Seoul Tower and we will be climbing Namsan, which is South Mountain in the city of Seoul. We've got quite the climb to get there. It is a beautiful fall day. The colors are looking very bright and we are just getting ready to climb up Namsan. The easiest way to get up the mountain is of course by cable car. We're going to hike it because we need the exercise. We're getting close to the tower and here are some impressive views of the city of Seoul down below us. After a long climb this is the object of our affection right behind us - Seoul Tower. And if climbing the mountain wasn't enough you can even do more exercise. Work it baby! Where are we? We're here at Namsan Tower - Seoul Tower! Today we're visiting Namsan Tower now know as Seoul Tower. It is still rolling. Oh, car coming. Bloopers. Namsan Cable Car. Ok, let's do this for real. Am I on? Yeah, of course I'm still filming. We are at Namdaemun market today. It is the largest and oldest open air market in all of Korea. We are going to show you the different kinds of foods you can buy in this alley. That looks pretty appetizing - what do you have there? It sure does. Well, we found some food on a stick here. They are different kind of battered food objects. If you want to take a look. We've got what appears to be a rice cake, kind of a lobster roll and as we go down a bit we've got sort of like a hot dog or sausage thingamajig. This is our first snack of the day. It looks tasty - let's try it! Okay, I'm going to have the rice one. Very classy! Nice! Alright, you're up. What are you going to have? I'm going to take a bite out of the hot dog, so let's see. Scarf it! That is nice and spicy. Is it? This is really good. Yeah. You'll have to try this one too. Sexy undies. Sexy undies. It is almost Halloween and as you can see we have a little pumpkins. Look at what we've got up here. It's a spider! When I first met Sam he agreed to wear one of these for Halloween. Of course I did. Oh, yeah. How about right there. Nice and pink which is just my style. Hotteok. Alma-eh-oh. Cheon Won EE Eh yo. So we have got a delicious treat called Hotteok. It is a fried kind of sweet treat. Inside it is filled with cinnamon, honey and sugary kind of goodness. You bite into it and it is really warm. It is perfect for the fall or winter. I will take the first bite here. Oh yeah, that is good. We found ourselves a nice little back-alley to enjoy. To feast on the hotteok. It is delicious. Show us how it is done. It is hot. Owe. Oh, nice the gooey-ness. It is made of honey. It is called Malt. M A L T. Actually honey is liquid, right? With boil this for one week and make it solid because I have to show you my performance. That is corn flour. You make a hole like this. You stretch, stretch little by little. This is a scuba diver. This store right behind us sells some medicinal herbs including ginseng. In a bottle. In here we have some interesting Korean style masks. They have various different exaggerated faces. One of them is happy. This one not so much. Now we are at Bauh House cafe near Hapjeong station where you can come and play with all kinds of dogs. How many friends do you have now? Two so far. The dog cafe is very similar to the cat cafe. You come in and order a drink basically and that allows you to stay as long as you want. Drinks are a little bit more than normal but 'hey' you get to play with dogs. This one has beautiful eyelashes. Look at you. That one is so tiny. Bring him here. For those visiting Seoul, the Cheonggyecheon, this gorgeous little steam right in the heart of Seoul. It is one of the nicest places to go walking. This stream did not exist a few years ago. It was made quite recently. This is obviously a much nicer place in the summer time. It is a lot greener and they have some festivals and art installations happening. There are a lot more people as well. Especially on a weekend on a hot summer day. It is packed! One of the nice things now is that we kind of have it to ourselves. Look, there is just a few people walking by and that is it. And you are shaking it. Off on the other side of the river we can hear some traditional Korean music as well as the sound of stomping horses, which kind of helps us tell the story that they are showing on the ceramics. Interrupting my pan. Hello, handsome. Over here we've found an artificial ice sculpture and I'm guessing with the lights that are set-up around it must look really spectacular at night. Here we have another ice sculpture - a frozen Christmas tree. Today we are at Gyeongbokgung Palace in central Seoul and this is the best known of the five Grand palaces in the city. Admission is only 3000 Won, which is less than $3 USD. As you can see you can also pose with the guards. Now we are going to go check out the changing of the guard ceremony, which takes place at the front gate. The guards are dressed in traditional costumes.",False,"20140504 - Things to do in Seoul Korea ∩╜£ Top Attractions Travel Guide To Seoul, South Korea.en.srt"

We got some smoked salmon. Oooh la lah! That looks tasty. We go ourselves a nice baguette sandwich to enjoy in the park. A lovely pasta salad with feta cheese and some fizzy drinks to go along. So we're just going to enjoy the view and savor our dinner. Mmmmmm! The smoked salmon is easily my favorite part of this little picnic. It's a wonderful cheap meal. We were able to get all of this food for just roughly 10 Euro. So instead of going out for dining tonight we just decided to hit up a local grocery store, pick out some things that look good and it's turned into a fantastic little feast here on the park bench. Hello bird! Music playing More music playing Our first impression of Finland. One of the things we've noticed the most is just how cool the temperature is. I'm loving it. I can walk outside and I'm not sweating profusely. This city is definitely a lot quieter than where we come from. We've been living in Thailand for a few months and we're used to tuk-tuk's, motorbikes, honking, swirving and everything just.....yeah and meanwhile you can hear sirens and motorbikes in the background. This totally disproves my point...hahaha Music playing We've also noticed there is a really big biking and fitness culture here. Everyone seems to be riding around on their bikes, in-line skating and in this kind of weather who can blame them. Music playing So this is a bit of a cool supermarket we found right here. If you are too busy to go get your groceries all you need is your little smart phone. You can the bar codes for milk, for meatballs, ravioli, whatever, and they just deliver it to your place just like that. Wow! Music playing So we just across a bridge with love locks and that kind of reminded me of our love lock video that we made back in Korea. So it is eight forty five PM right now but as you can see it is still daylight out and that's because we are in the land of the midnight sun. So that's just a quick little intro into Helsinki we're both really tired so we're going to go get caught up some sleep and we'll make some more videos this week. Background music playing. Okay, we are with Raakel my Finnish Canadian friend who is showing us around and we're going to an Island called Suomenlinna. Does that mean anything? It's like Finland. It's kind of like a castle. Background music playing. So we've arrived here finally and we honestly have no idea what we're going to be doing. There is no tourist information. We're just going to wander around. Looks like a village. A cute village. I think this looks like Anne of Green Gable in Finland. The cute little wooden houses, right? Background music playing. We've just witnessed a lovely Finnish wedding on an island. Background music playing. And what are we doing? Enjoying some ice cream. Perfect way to cool down after a little walk around the island. What flavors do you have? Pistachio. And I have raspberry sherbet. And what is that in Finnish? Finnish answer. And I'm having the one unique to Finland. Black licorice ice cream and it is delicious. What is this called in Finnish? Speaking bad Finnish. Lemon and black licorice. Wow, this is really really good. I don't believe it. Background music playing. Alright, tonight we've got a special Finnish treat to share you. This here is called Salmiakki and it is black extremely salty licorice. So my sister Ashley has a been to Finland before and she specifically told me to stay away from this nasty candy. She says it is the worst tasting thing ever out there and that I will spit it out within seconds. So I'm not really looking forward to eating a piece of it but Sam here is quite adamant about it. So this Salmiakki here, this black licorice has sometimes been referred to foreigners as a kind of fear factor food that. The television show the Fear Factor where people are dared to eat something that seems disgusting and really strange. What gives this the salty taste is ammonia chloride and this is very popular in Nordic countries - especially in Finland. That doesn't sound edible. Alright, so here is a piece of the Salmiakki. The black licorice. And I have to say that I've grown up eating licorice in Canada and it is probably quite a bit sweeter than this one and I'm a big licorice fan, so I'm hopeful that I am going to like this even thought it apparently exceptionally salty. So here we go. Eating noises and chewing Woah! Yeah! There is an explosion of flavors going on and that is just...WoW! That is very salty but I like it. Here's another piece. MMMMM! I have a bar of milk chocolate handy over here because I know I'm probably going to need to wash away the flavor of this nasty looking thing. I'm just taking a small bite okay. Eating noises Yummy? Arrrrggggggh!!! Spitting noise! Hahahahaha Did you just spit it out? I don't like licorice. I've never liked licorice and that's just foul. Okay, where is your chocolate piece now? Better? Good, because that means I get more (of the Salmiakki). MMMMMMM Two more pieces in my mouth here. Eating noises...MMMM I'm glad you don't like it because that means I get to eat the whole bag. Okay, so today we're going to go Sea Kayaking and we're visiting some of the islands around the Archipelago here in Kimito Island and I'm all suited up to go out in the water. Hahaha! You sure are. Hello, I'm Benjamin. I work as a Sea Kayak guide in the Archipelago sea. It's a natural park. We have a lot of people from abroad who are coming here knowing about the Archipelago sea and want to see what it is like here. And Sea kayaking is really a good way to experience the wilderness. Background music playing. Meh! haha! Bababha! Background music playing. So how is the kayaking going so far? It's going great. We're just taking a short little break and came across some sheep who are just grazing by the sea. I guess by the sea. And my legs fell asleep so I had to get out for a while. But other than that it is going awesome. No capsizing so far. No. Background music playing. Very graceful. Hahaha! I got the video. You're still alive? Hello, I arrived. Still dry. Background music playing. Soaked little puppy. I am. I managed to make it the entire sea kayaking journey without capsizing. At the very end I flipped the boat over when I was getting out. So this was an awesome experience. We went sea kayaking and we were just paddling through wilderness and these small little islands where we saw different kinds of wildlife. All kinds of different birds. It was just awesome and it was a real workout too. We did this for a few hours. I'm exhausted now but Ioved every minute of it. Okay, so I was told that usually one in ten people capsize the kayak. I survived the whole four hour journey. I am still dry so I think I did pretty good. Background music playing. Today we're in the little town of Kasnas and we are waiting to catch a ferry that is going to take us to a very remote island, which apparently is home to one of the largest lighthouses in the area. Background music playing. We are now visiting Rosala which is an island which is home to a Viking Center. So we enjoyed a really hearty Viking feast that was a thick soup with potatoes and white fish and we also had some black rye bread with butter and after that meal we've just been enjoying the island. There is lots of games and activities for kids. You can try archery. You can try walking on stilts. They have a maze. Rabbits that you can feed. So it's a nice place to spend a sunny day. Laughing. Background music playing. We've arrived at the lighthouse and it's just on a big rock out in the sea. So to get here we had to take a boat. We've been traveling for about forty five minutes and as we were approaching the island it started to get really choppy. The waves are pretty high. So yeah, we're out here in the middle of the ocean. There is no land. It is just a pile of rocks. I don't know what is worse. Air turbulence or choppy waters. Background music playing. So right now we're making our way up the two hundred and fifty two steps that we have to climb all the way up to get to the top of the lighthouse. And apparently there is a couple of ladders too. And here in the lighthouse they also have a very small chapel where people can get married. Background music playing. Live rock music. So we are trying three different Finnish beers. We have lager, red ale and I have forgotten the name of this one. Verdict? That's nice. A nice light beer. Okay, next red ale. I like the flavor of this one a little more. What does it taste like? It's just got more of a bite to it. This is a lighter beer for sure. And the last one? My favorite. Really? It's all about the flavor. Alright, your turn. I'm going to start off with the light one. Lager. It tastes like a light beer. I don't know much about beer. Red ale. It has a nice aroma to it and it is a bit stronger than the other one. I agree. This I'm not so sure I will like it just based on the color. It looks really strong. Okay, what is your favorite of the three? I'm going to go with the light girly beer. Surprise, surprise. Rock music playing live. Background music playing. We're going to be eating Rudolph the Reindeer today! I'm a little sad about it but I'm in Finland so I have to try reindeer. Reindeer? Is it tasty or what? It really is. It has a very rich taste. It's must different from the meatballs we had before the other day. This definitely has a real much stronger taste to it. Wow. if I had to compare it to something that tastes like a really strong seasoned roast beef. I'm going to think of it as salami. Okay, it tastes like salami. There we go. I'm eating Reindeer. It's a little sour. Right? Yeah. It's a little sour and salty. Okay. Do you like it? Yeah. It's growing on you? Well, not growing on me but it's okay. Live rock music playing. So Sam has been talking about the reindeer ever since we landed in Finland, so I'm glad he finally got to try it. It was a bit of a pricey appetizer I have to admit. It was sixteen Euro. A bit steep but it was a good experience. I'd say it was worth it. The reindeer cold cuts definitely had a distinct taste. Quite sour and it was certainly a lot better than meatballs we had tried the other day. So this is day two in Helsinki. It is chilly as ever and we are going to do some sightseeing maybe visit a few churches and markets. And if we can we want to have reindeer meat at some point in the day. Oh, you are eating Santa's Helper! I'm going to be taking a bite out of Rudolph. background music playing. We found a little dog park. Let's see how friendly these pups are. Ruff. Bark. Bark. Let's go. Background music playing. And here we are introducing Uspenski Cathedral. This is one of the best known churches in Helsinki and it is an Eastern Orthodox church. Background music playing. This particular vantage point on the walk is one of the most popular areas in the city for people to have picnics. While we were walking here yesterday we saw about four or five different groups over here just having their own little picnic and just watching the city as things go by. Background music playing. Hello. What am I? I didn't see her body. Music playing by street musicians. Background music playing. We are here in Harbor Market. It seems to be one of the bigger markets in Helsinki and what we've found to eat. We've found reindeer meatballs. So we're going to go try those right now. Reindeer meatballs here we go. Hi, could we please try the reindeer meatballs? Yes, sure. Those are big meatballs. I think those are potatoes. Would you like some vegetables as well? Oh, sure, yeah. How about garlic sauce? Um, sure, yeah, please. Background music playing. Oh no, I'm not ready but geez I don't have much of a choice. I'm filming. That seems like a big enough chunk, right? It is! And what are you having? Reindeer meatballs. First bite. Is it good? It tastes like a regular meatball. Okay. Yeah, it doesn't have a very strong reindeer flavor. It's more garlic-y from all of the sauce we put over top. And these have to be the biggest meatballs I have ever seen in my whole life. Okay. Let's see what you think of it. Yeah, they don't have as distinct of a flavor as I thought they may. But what I really like here is this garlic sauce that has been put over top. Background music playing. We're back here at the market. This time we've got a salmon dish. Same price. About 10 Euros. This is smothered in garlic sauce. I already know I'm going to like it. Oh, wow. that just melts in your mouth. While we've been exploring the archipelago region for the past week we've actually been staying in this town. It has two names - the Swedish name is Dalsbruk and then the Finnish name is Taalintehdas. Most of the residents in this small community are Swedish native speakers and they also speak Finnish fluently. Some of the oldest ruins in town and they were used during the coal industry. That is our abbreviated tour of Dalsbruk - a place many come to vacation in nice cottages to go fishing, to go sailing - it is a very scenic place. We're going to miss it. We're going to give you a little tour of a Finnish supermarket and we'll see what strange food items we can find. So smoked salmon is very popular food over here. You eat it with Rye bread. That's something we had almost everyday. Background music playing. We're also buying some Salmiakki, which is black salty licorice. I detested the taste of it but Sam really like it and apparently so does his Dad, so this is for him. This is a present for my Dad. For George. Background music playing. So in Finland there are many different kinds of alcoholic beers and beverages to choose from that you even have licorice flavored Salmiakki beer. So chocolate is extremely popular in Finland and there is no brand more famous than Karl Fazer. Background music playing. Black rye bread is always a really popular. We've been eating this daily with butter and cheese and smoked salmon on top. Canada represent. We've got some Maple Syrup. And of course the lumberjack.",False,20140428 - Things to do in Finland ∩╜£ Top Attractions Travel Guide To Finland (Ultimate Compilation).en.srt

Background music playing. So we finally made it to Petra and it was the best introduction ever. We had to walk through the canyon for about an hour with our guide and he kept stopping and explaining little things. And right before we reached the treasury he distracted the whole group and he was showing us something up on the rocks and then he's like no that's not what I actually want to show you, so then when we turned around we could see the treasury through the slit in the canyon and it was the best view ever. Music playing in the background. Bedouin man playing music and singing. Horse trotting sounds. So Petra has a few nicknames. It's known as the Lost City because it was forgotten for such a long time and it is also known as the Rose City as you can see because of the color of the stone, it's a nice pinkish orange. Meowing like a cat to the theme song from Indiana Jones. Cats fighting noise. Background music playing. So some tips for visiting Petra, it's a lot like other archaeological sites. It's best to arrive early in the morning or potentially visit later on in the day. Late in the morning, early in the afternoon is literally the worst time to be here. Not just because of the crowds but because of the weather. It's a really smart idea to bring lots of water, pack some sunscreen and if you get really tired you can always ride a donkey, a camel or a horse. There is a lot of transportation options available. Music playing in the background. Okay, so next up we're going to go visit the courtyard palace and we need to go up these steps and around and it is a very hot day, so hopefully we make it. Background music playing. So we are now inside one of the tombs and it is a very dark and cool here, which we are enjoying. We need to cool off for a minute. But actually what is interesting about these tombs is that up until the 1980's there were Bedouins living in here with their entire families. Background music playing. So that concludes our trip to Petra. We are just heading out now. It's been a long day and I think we can both agree that it is impossible to cover the entire archaeological site in a day or even in half a day. I think you need at least three. Background music playing. This one is a lot smoother and gooier than the one we had in Israel. Is it? Show me the big lovely pile of mud. That you're going to smear all over yourself. I am. Because it is good for you. Background music. So we are back in the Dead Sea again. A few weeks ago we visited on the other Israeli side and this time we've crossed over to Jordan. I'm getting muddy. I think you just like to get Muddy, that's all. I do but you know what - last time I skimped out a little and I didn't cover my entire body in mud. So I'm trying to be dirtier this time around. Hahahaha Music in the background playing. And now time for the facial. Right in your eyes. Rub it in your eyes. Come on. Hahahaha! Nice. I probably am not supposed to get it on my lips. No. Probably not. But you like to break the rules. Music playing in the background. So the mud has started to dry on my body. I think it's time to go into the water and wash off. Music playing in the background. So I think I maybe lasted for about three minutes in the Dead Sea this time around. Yesterday I rode a camel in the morning and it didn't rub me the right way. Camel Burn!!! So going in a salty ocean wasn't a very pleasant feeling. But Sam is going to go back in, right? Background music playing. Normally I've very good at sinking but right now I'm floating. And this over here may look like ice or snow but it's actually salt. Crystallized salt. Here we have a few more chunks of salt in my hand. Music playing in the background. Background music playing. So another new country for us. Today we are in Jordan. We just landed in Amman yesterday and this morning we are exploring the Ancient city of Jerash and now this is a Greco-Roman city so it belonged to the Greeks then it was converted by the Romans and the architecture was slighted changed so we're going to be showing you some of that. Music playing. Drums and Bagpipes. Background music playing. So this is a Roman planned theater. When in use it could sit up to three thousand people and it was used for all kinds of performances. Background music playing. Meow. Meow. Background music playing. We're now at the temple of Artemis the Goddess of the Sea. Background music playing. So with the wall we were looking at just behind the olive press you can track the three different civilizations because at the very bottom you have the Greek blocks which were all different sizes and didn't really match. Then you can see the Roman style which were the big blocks of limestone and then at the very top there were smaller blocks which were placed by an Islamic culture. Background music playing. This particular section was only uncovered in the 1970's. Prior to that it was underground. Music playing in the background. Background music. So this morning we are doing something called the Bedouin experience which means we are visiting a village with a local Bedouin and he's just showing us around some of the things his family do. Like how they make coffee, how they take care of their goats. We're going to be showing you that. And we've been invited into this tent. Right here. This is the Bedouin tent. This is the men's part. Bedouin tents are divided for two parts. One for the women and one for the men. So always when there is guests this will be separate. The women will go to women part and the men will come to the men part. Background music. Do you want to smell? Oh yeah, that's good. This will give you energy. Ooooh! Wonderful. How does it smell Audrey? Like coffee! Bang Bang Bang. More banging noises. So when I serve it for you I will give you the cup in my right hand and if you have to hold it in your right hand. And you have to be sitting. I think all of you are sitting in the right way to have coffee. If you're lying down it's not respectful to have coffee, so you have to respect the meaning of the coffee and the host. We don't give the coffee for somebody lying down. We should be sitting up. Background music. So the Bedouin are a nomadic people. This right here is their summer home and they're just in the process of moving to the winter home which is just over there. The winter home is more protective as it has coverage from the wind, blocked by hills and mountains. Background music playing. We've also been learning a little bit about Bedouin hospitality and apparently if a stranger wanders into your home it is common for you to offer them to stay for a maximum of three nights with no questions asked and after that they will either inquire 'why are you here? Where are you going? Or you are free to leave and go your way. Background music. I have coal on my eyes. Does it look good? It does. Beautiful. Just stop moving. That's so funny. Another day another off roading trip. Today we're exploring Wadi Rum. Okay, I'm posing. Do the crazy face again too. Tea time. Music playing in the background. Singing and chanting noises by Bedouin men. More singing and chanting sounds. That's our dinner being dug up. Music playing in the background. We had a big communal meal that was cooked in the sand. It was really cool watching the Bedouins dig it up and take it out. Extract it from the earth. So here we are in a little Bedouin camp. Last night we spent the evening in the desert and we're just waking up. The sun is not up yet but we can hear the camels growling in the back. Music playing in the background. Argilah. Egypt Sheesha. Jordan Algelah. Smoking and bubble noises. Bubble noises. Yella Yella, it's time to go and this is our transportation for breakfast. We're riding camels to a site where we're going to have some food. Oooh. Audrey's first time on a camel. Well done. Enjoying that? Yeah. How do you feel being on the camel? Very mighty. You're really high up. Laughing. It's so funny. Are you having fun? Yeah. You were born to ride camels Audrey. Background music playing. Growl noise in slow motion. Background music playing. Right now we're at the Captains tent and we rode our camels over here. It was about 30 minutes to reach our breakfast destination and we are all very sore. Especially our inner thighs. I feel as though I was tenderized. Music playing in the background. We're in Amman this morning and we're going to be checking out the Citadel which is right behind us. Background music playing. The fractured fingers we just saw were believed to have belong to Hercules but our guide said they looked a little bit too feminine, so no one actually really knows. Background music playing. Here from the Citadel one of the things I'm enjoying the most are the wonderful panoramic views we've had walking all around the premises. Background music playing. We're going to go visit the Palace that sits atop of the Citadel. It's in ruins now but let's go see what is left of it. Background music playing. So the flag that we see in the background is actually the forth tallest flag in the world. It used to be third until Abu Dhabi took its place.

It's our first meal in Scotland, so we've decided to go with something very typical. We're going to be eating the National dish, which is Haggis. So let's go into Whisky Room. So today's meal is all about Haggis. We are starting with Haggis spring rolls. So let's see what those are like. We've had a lot of spring rolls lately in Thailand, Vietnam and other places in SE Asia. Mmmmmm. Never Haggis. And it's also the first time trying haggis. Oh, so hot! Is it hot? Mmmmmm. I'm pleasantly surprised. Oh, yeah. Haggis is good people! Those are hot. Mmmmmm. Wow, so many flavors. It's delicious. I think I've found myself my new favorite spring roll. Haggis spring rolls. Background my playing. So for those of you who aren't familiar with Haggis it's a savory pudding made with sheep's pluck. And that means a sheep's heart, liver and lungs. And if that doesn't sound appetizing enough it's wrapped in the sheep's stomach and it also includes spices and some oats and onions. So that's what we're going to be trying. Background music playing. It's time to cover this bad boy in some gravy. Oh my, oh my. Look at that. So Haggis is served with neeps and tatties, which is basically turnips and potatoes. First bite. So I've got lots of haggis here. Neeps and tatties. Lots of gravy. The verdict. It's awesome. Yeah. That's not an acquired taste. I love it on the very first bite. Do you like it as much as I do? It's a really nice rich winter dish. And like normally I don't like organs. I've had liver before and it has a very strong flavor but somehow when it's all mixed together and they add spices and the gravy it's perfect. I like it. I like haggis! And it's a cold day today so I'm trying something else very Scottish here. It's a nice warm drink. It's called a Hot Toddy. It's got hot water, whisky, lemon and honey. And that sounds good to me. Take a sip. Oh yeah. It goes down nice. Okay, First sip of the Hot Toddy. I'm not I've ever even tried this whiskey. So let's how it is in a hot drink. Ooooh. It's nice. It really warms you up but it's not a strong and overpowering as I thought it would be. This is nice. And it's also very aromatic because they've put some cloves along with the lemon. Like Christmas. So far you're liking Scottish food. Yeah. Background music playing. Background music playing. What's your name? Sam. Sam how you doing man? We're doing a deep-fried snickers, a Twix and we've already done a Mars bar already. Awesome. I'm going to unwrap it. Stick it in the batter. I can't tell you that because it's my secret. Hahaha...secret recipe? Of course. The Twix. One. Two. Mix it around. Give it a little shake. And there it goes. Ah, that looks good. Now for the Twix. Here is the Twix. There you go. How long do you put them in there? Emmmm, we just keep it about...2 or 3 minutes. We fry them separately. This is just for the Mars bars. Mars bars only. Awesome. So the temperature. This is 170 degrees. And while the batter cooks the chocolate will melt. So the batter will cook before the chocolate. Ahhh, perfect. That's so cool. So we've been hearing lots about the Mars bars but Sam here went overboard and tried three different chocolate bars that have been deep fried. So what do you have? Well, at the recommendation of the guy at the chip shop. He recommended I also try the Snickers and the Twix bar, so we've got it all right here. Let's unwrap that. I don't want to drop it here. Okay. Let's see that thing of beauty. Isn't that gorgeous. Alright, so which is which? So I believe this is the Snickers. We've got the two Twixes here and that is the Mars bar. Alright. And you're feeling a little queasy today, so I'm going to be the one trying them all. Yes, you are. Enjoy! So first up. And you can tell they really feel as though they've been deep-fried and melted. This is flimsy in the hand. Ewww. Yeah, this is a Mars bar. I can tell from what is seeping out. Take a bite. Oh, Wow. That is so much better than just having it on its own. It's all melted inside. It's gooey. And you've got the crispiness from the batter on the outside. Mmmmmm. One more bite. Next up Twix. Next up we have the Twix. This one is a little longer. Oh yeah. Is it still crunchy? Yeah, it's still crunchy on the inside. You can see this. All the chocolate has melted on the outside. It's just so much better than having it normally. And the best for last. Best for last. My favorite of all these bars is the Snickers, so I have high expectations for the deep-fried version here. The battered version. Oh yeah. It just melts. All caramel and chocolate inside and the peanuts. Oh,. Let's see the inside of it? That is amazing. Okay, so you've tried all three. Which was our favorite? Definitely the Snickers. Why? Because I love Snickers bars and this just enhanced it. So, it's not surprising that taking something that is already unhealthy and making it even unhealthier would make it taste better. Music playing. So this afternoon we are going to be doing a little bit of a taste test. So we've raided a Scottish supermarket and picked out some items that we thought looked very local. So we're going to try those and see what they're like. Yeah, overall we've got five different things. Two beverages and three things to eat. So first up I'm going to be trying something called Irn Bru and apparently after Whisky this is Scotland's second national drink and it looks like a regular fizzy drink. It kind of looks like it could be orange flavored but I hear it's just sweet and doesn't really taste like fruit. Oh, I'm going to need help opening this. Hahahaha Rawwwr. Thank you kindly. So it smells very sweet and sugary. It doesn't smell like orange. Hahaha. It's a bit like cream soda maybe. It's just really really sweet. Like sweeter than Pepsi or 7Up. Oh yeah? Yeah, it reminds me a lot of cream soda as well. Which isn't my favorite beverage, so overall I don't think I'm going to be an Irn Bru man anytime soon. Next up we've got Mackie's of Scotland's Haggis and cracked black pepper flavored chips or crisps as they like to call them here. Right, exactly. Chips here would be referring to like french fries, so we're going to call these crisps. Let's open it up here. It's going to be like Kettle style chips. Crisps, I mean. Kettle style crisps. Let's try this. You can tell that has a smokey flavor. Can you taste the Haggis? Ummmm, yeah, kind of but I mean it has more of a an all dressed smokey flavor in my opinion. I do like them. Why won't you be trying any of those delectable crisps? Well, I got really sick shortly after eating Haggis, so just the name, just the sound of Haggis kind of makes my stomach turn a little bit, so I'm staying away from haggis flavored chips this time around, which is good for me because I get to eat them all. I like them. Good. And what do we have here? Next up we have Crabbie's. Here in the back it says that it is best served chilled with ice and lemon but we have neither of those. Room temperature? And actually we don't even know if this is Scottish or not but I think so. Let's assume. It says following in the pioneering footsteps of the first Scots. Well, there we go. And what is it? I think it's a Ginger beer isn't it? Ginger beer, okay. With alcohol. Hmmmmm, what does that mean? Ginger beer. Hahahaha. That's exactly what is is. It tastes very gingery? Yes, I don't love beer, so I'm not going to say I love it but it's a nice smell. It smells like ginger tea. Tell me how you like it? Oh yeah, I like that a lot. It's got a very. It's quite sweet. I mean normally beer doesn't have this sweet of a taste, so this is a nice refreshing beverage. Refreshing at room temperature. True. And we've got Butterscotch chocolate. Let's give it a go. Hahaha, that's upside down but that's okay. Let's try a piece of this. Mmmmmm. Oh wow! Oh yeah, you really taste the butterscotch. It's creamy and sweet and delicious. Is this milk chocolate or is it dark bitter chocolate? No, it's really sweet. You'll love it. It kind of reminds me of Dulce de Leche. Dulce de Leche chocolate huh? Like it then? Yeah. I do like it. I mean normally organic chocolate isn't that great in my opinion because it's a little bitter. A bit too natural for me. But this is quite nice. She takes another bite. Nice and sweet. It's creamy. Shortbread cookies. This is Christmas in a tin. Mmmm, smells like Christmas? Oooooh, those look good. I can tell I'm going to like this. Nice big thick cookies. Crispy? Not crispy. Just crunchy Christmas cookies, you know? Mmmmmm. Going to share those? Maybe. You know this would make a really souvenir people. If you're visiting Scotland get Scottish shortbread. Those are real good. It reminds me of my Mom's shortbread cookies. She used to make for me for Christmas and I would eat a lot of those. And last but not least we have tablet, which is a sweet treat that everyone has been talking about. And this is what I'm most looking forward to having. This is supposed to be very much like fudge and so I can't wait to try it. This one is whisky flavored. Mmmmm....mmmm. Oh yeah! So I'm just going to go at this like it's a chocolate bar. Just bite right in. Smells good. Oh, wow. That is really really really sweet. Is it soft, crunchy, gooey, chewy? It's a little. I wouldn't call it crunch. It kind of crumbles in your mouth and yeah I can taste a hint of the whisky. I mean it's not overpowering. It's more sweet than anything else but there is definitely a hint of whisky. It smells like cheese. Take a bite. That's the smallest nibble ever. Okay, it's sweet when you taste it but it smells like cheese. I'm not kidding. Is that the whisky smell? Could be yeah. Do you like the taste though? Yes. Even though I'm just nibbling at it. I'm like grazing it with my teeth. It does taste nice. Very sweet. The smell? Mmmmm-ooooh. The smell doesn't do it for you? It gets a nay from me. Okay, so favorites. What was the best thing you ate? I really liked the tablet and the ginger beer the most. Why? Well, I just love to eat fudge and I like to drink beer - especially anything with ginger in it. Gingery beers....mmmmm. Okay, so my favorite I would say was the shortbread cookies. Those were really nice. It reminds me of Christmas and least favorite I'd have to say the tablet just because it smelled really bad. I'm sure regular tablet is great but the Whisky flavored one I'm telling you it smells like cheese. Like go buy a pack and sniff that and come back to me. And I think the thing we both didn't like was the Irn Bru. Yeah, it's a bit too sweet but not terrible. I didn't like it at all. That was my least favorite by far. Anyways, so yeah when you come to Scotland try out these products and try out other things and let us know what you think. And if you have any suggestions of things that we should try while we're here in Edinburgh just leave it in the comments below. I think tomorrow we're going to be hunting for some deep-fried pizza. Number one goal. Yeah, we just had the deep-fried chocolate bars today so. Okay, tootles.

We just arrived in Istanbul and I have to say this is a place that is love at first sight. I'm absolutely loving it here. The weather is cool. I've been able to walk around without sweating. I'm loving the food and there are just so many random and quirky things going on all at once. Like I just weighed myself on a bridge. Background music playing. What are you about to do over here? I just purchased a little plate of some seeds or nuts here. And I'm going to go feed some pigeons. Alright, let's go feed them. They look hungry. Get them to come to you. Maybe they'll eat out of your hand. Those birds look a bit overfed and they weren't too interested in what Sam was feeding them. Background music playing. We've been looking for souvenirs to take back home. I would definitely recommend stocking up on these sweets. Background music playing. So we are back at our little apartment that we're renting here on Osmanby in Istanbul and we wanted to finish our first impressions video. So after half a day of sightseeing I would say that Istanbul is very pedestrian friendly. We were able to walk around a lot and see lots of the main attractions. So someone underwent a drastic transformation since this morning. What happened to your face Sam? I went for a proper shave at a barber and it was really affordable and wonderful. I don't know if anyone has ever had a wet / proper shave at a barber. It feels a hundred times better than doing it yourself. And one of the things that we've really liked so far about Istanbul is that it has been more affordable than what we had expected. Like my shave didn't cost much. Four dollars or something like that. We seriously can't wait to explore more of the city in the coming days. Background music playing. Today I'm giddy like a kid in a candy shop. That's because I'm in a candy shop and I'm coming to try one of my favorite desserts - Turkish Delight. So it comes in all shapes, flavors and colors. I think we're going to try sample a mix of everything. Background music. Love the samplers here. Some sampling today. How is it? It's really nice. We're taking some with us. I've got a menu here with such a wide selection of Turkish Delight, I don't even know where to begin. Come take a look. We've got strawberry, we've got pomegranate, lemon, orange, kiwi. Background music playing. She's here finally. Yes. We're eating Turkish Delight. We were waiting for her. Six months. Background music playing. So this is my plate of Turkish Delight. I've got pomegranate with pistachio and nuts and it's covered in shredded coconut and I am not sharing with Sam because he won't share his with me. Oooh lala. Mmmmmm. Hahaha. You're reacting to food like me. I'm reacting to him. Ask me. And I've got strawberry Turkish Delight. These are my favorite. Ooh, I've got a sweet tooth and my sweet tooth is in heaven right now. I was first introduced to Turkish Delight while reading the Lion, the Witch and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis. I became intrigued as a young child and I had to try it out. It instantly became one of my favorite candies and now here I am as an adult eating in again in Turkey. So I got myself a nice little glass of Turkish tea over here. Sam, what did you get? And I have some apple tea. I'm going to try it. Oh, that's really nice. It tastes a lot like a warm apple cider. It's really sweet and it's got a strong after-taste. Turkish Delight come in many different flavors. This one here is what you would call a very simple one. It's just got icing sugar covering it. It doesn't have any nuts. The most expensive ones from what I've seen are the ones that have pistachios and all other kinds of nuts stuffed inside. Background music playing. We took care of that plate, so much for my diet today. Singing to Mission impossible song. Today it's my birthday and I can't think of a better way to celebrate than by going into the Grand Bazaar right behind me. We're going shopping. Background music playing. So we made it to the Grand Bazaar. This is one of the largest and oldest covered markets in the entire world and it takes up sixty one streets and it has over three thousand shops though I have a feeling it's still growing and spreading out across the city. Background music playing. So inside the market there are different alleys that specialize in different things. You have an area where you can just buy jewelry, an area where it is rugs and an area where you can get slippers, you can get shoes, you can get. You name it you can find it here. Yes. Background music playing. It's always crowded here at the Grand Bazaar but the best time to come is early in the morning. There is not as many people. Background music playing. Well, I have a reputation of being a man of many hats. Well, this is my new birthday hat. It came in at three Lira which is about a dollar fifty. I think it was a great purchase. Thank you for the present. Happy birthday. Yeah! Background music playing. Background music playing. We're visiting the Basilica Cistern. It's the largest of all of the cisterns. There are several hundred here in Istanbul and this is by far the most impressive. Background music playing. So I think I just did that for good luck. There is this one special column with a little hole and people are sticking in their thumbs and doing a full circle with their hand. So, let's hope there is good fortune coming my way. Background music playing. So the Basilica Cistern has three hundred and thirty six marble columns. They are nine meters in height and they are spaced at four meters in between each of them. The Cisterns were built during the 6th Century during the Byzantine Empire under the rule of Justinian. Background music playing. So we just saw two Medusa heads. One upside down and one on the side. Nobody knows where they came from people believe they're from an old Roman building. Background music playing. So Istanbul is definitely a city for cat lovers. It's a city we're going to show you all the friendly kittens that are just strolling the streets. They are collectively taken care of by the community. People just leave out food for them and little bowls with water. So in a way they're Istanbul's pets. Look who has got my shirt. Aren't you having fun with it. So cute. The back feet. Background music playing. More music playing. Meow. Hi. Meow. Meow. We're both pet lovers and we'd love to have cats and dogs someday but because of our nomadic ways we can't so this has been a real treat being able to walk on the streets - pet cats, feed them and just interact. It's been awesome. Background music playing. So we are back in Istanbul again. We have our museum passes which give us seventy two hours to explore the main attractions and we are starting off with Topkapi Palace here behind us. And this is one of the oldest and largest palaces in the whole world. Background music playing. The sheer size of this place is impressive. At one point they had four thousand people living here. Background music playing. We've got amazing views from here of the Golden Horn. Background music playing. Now we are about to enter the Chamber of Turbans and this is where all of the turbans were worn by the Sultans were kept. Background music playing. Circumcision room. Oh my! Background music playing. It looks remarkably similar to the Sultan's turban room. Background music playing. That concludes our little visit to Topkapi Palace. The place is absolutely massive, so we tried to cover as much as we could and hopefully we saw all the main sites. Background music playing. Today we're outside of Hagia Sophia. One of the true landmarks of Istanbul. And over the years this has been an Orthodox Cathedral, a Roman Catholic Cathedral and a mosque. Background music playing. It's nice being VIP with our Istanbul museum passes. We don't have to wait here. Background music playing. So Hagia Sophia was built in the 6th century by Emperor Justinian. And at the time it was one of the largest Christian Basilicas in the whole world. Background music playing. So right now we're climbing up to the second level, so that we can get a better view of the church. Background music playing. Today they're doing some restoration work to preserve both its Christian and Muslim past. So many of the Christian mosaics have been uncovered even though they had once been plastered over. At the same time you can see some of the Arabic writing with readings from the Koran. So it's a nice balance between the two faiths. Background music playing. Call to prayer. Background music playing. This morning we are visiting the Blue Mosque also known as Sultan Ahmed Mosque and it is absolutely packed. We arrived here at around 10 am and the lines were wrapping all around the courtyard. It took about 15 minutes to get in but it's absolutely worth it. Background music playing. It's absolutely enormous here. There are six towering minarets, two hundred and sixty windows and twenty thousand tiles just in the main area. Background music playing. As a man when visiting the mosque this is the type of outfit that you're allowed to wear. T-shirt is fine. You're going to want to have long pants and you're going to want to be wearing socks. And if you forgot some of these things they do have other items that you can cover up with inside. And as a girl you'll want to cover your head, your shoulders and your legs. And don't forget the socks. Yes, and bring socks because you will have to take your shoes off before you go in. Background music playing. So our conclusion from visiting. It's a very impressive mosque. It's one of the largest in the world. I loved going inside. It's amazing to see but crowds are something to contend with definitely.

It's about eight o'clock and the town is still sleepy. There is hardly any people on the street, so we're going to go have breakfast at our favorite Israeli restaurant and then we're going to bike around the area. Background music playing. We've only been in Yangshuo for three days yet we've eaten at this very restaurant seven times. Cafe Mimosa. What is so amazing about it? When it's good, it's good. You come back. So what are we having for breakfast this morning? Let's see. Well, my favorite feature here are two things. We've got homemade fresh banana bread. MMMM. It's just got so many nuts and different ingredients in it. It's really tasty. really healthy. And then anytime I can get my hands on hummus in the morning. Oh my. With fresh pita. Fresh, fresh, fresh. We have some museli. I got myself some eggs and a nice cup of tea. We're happy. Background music playing. One of the best views in Yangshuo is unfortunately by the Ronald McDonald. Background music playing. Chinese music playing in the park. We've rented a couple of bikes and we've decided to spend our last morning exploring around the countryside areas of Yangshuo. They were pretty cheap. Just under two dollars for each bike. Background music playing. Hello. Hello. So we've been biking for a while now and we've reached the countryside, so we're just taking a little break here by this lily pond. Background music playing. So now after a long bike ride we're just hanging out on the rooftop of our hostel Monkey Jane and it has some amazing views. Check it out. Background music playing. Today we are visiting a local hill tribe that just lives a few hours outside of Guilin and we've come here because this community is known for the women's long hair. They grow it out and it's almost a meter and a half long and we're actually going to be watching a performance where they spin their hair and wrap it up and show us how they wear it. Singing. Singing and music. Singing with announcer. Music and singing. Music playing. Chinese singing. Drumming. So that was one of the funniest performances to watch because I guess in this culture the women show the men they care for them by pinching their butts, so some foreigners got brought on stage to help demonstrate how things work and they were just having their little buns pinched and it was quite fun to watch. So Sam, you saw a bit of action today didn't you? I can't remember the last time I had my butt pinched that many times. So as part of the marriage ceremony the participants had to get up on stage and also sing to their brides. Luckily none of them seemed very shy. They did a good job. What if they had chosen you to go up and sing? Hahahaha. I would have butchered it. So tonight is our very last night in Yangshuo, a charming little town in Southwestern China, so we're going to show you around the main strip. background music playing. So our first stop is going to be the street food market. I haven't eaten in maybe two hours, so it's time to get a snack. So you're officially starving. Starving. Ravenous! Background music playing. So what are you going to have? Some meat. Oh la la. On a stick? background music playing. Alright, happy boy with this meat. Let's see how this tastes. Hot? Very tender. Very smokey. Well seasoned. This is good stuff. So I notice that she put lots of spices while she was cooking this. It's really spicy! I'm just tasting that now. Oh, it's hot! Oh, that's got some nice kick to it. Really tasty. background music playing. Another favorite of yours. What are you having this time? We're getting the ever popular backpacker meal the banana pancake. Oh la la. This time Chinese style. background music playing. Alright, big bite. Piping hot. I can barely hold this. Mmmmmm. This is a different style. They actually smush the banana and put it right in the middle. As opposed to cutting it into little slices. Is it tasty? Yeah. It's good. If I had to choose between Guilin and Yangshuo the two most popular cities in this region it's definitely Yangshuo. It's a more historic town. It's a lot more pedestrian friendly and there are great things to eat here. Background music playing. Man playing flute. Lady playing flute. Background music playing. As we were wandering around the night market tonight we had lots of people come up to us and ask to take photos beside us. At least probably four or five times and we finally filmed the last one. It was really cool. We were like celebrities in China. Yeah, almost famous. So, this market had some pretty cool souvenirs. We saw fake Chinese passports if you want to take one of those home. They also had combs carved out of ox bone. They had these stamps where you can get your Chinese name carved on them and then you can just sign documents that way which is pretty cool. Here we are at the Longji Rice Fields which are located just outside of Guilin. We've had such good luck. Check out the weather and the views behind. Background music playing. So we are hiking up to one of the viewing platforms. This is going to be tough because it's like forty degrees outside and we're been told it'll take 30 minutes to one hour depending on our pace. So I'm trying to stay hydrated. Audrey is going to have to workout today. Awwwww. It's tired. It's so cute. Hello! Background music playing. I don't know. Update number two. Still struggling. even sweatier but we're slowly gaining ground. Watch out! You may die along the way. And there is someone behind you. Sam over here just met a cat. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Who can meow the loudest? Well, thankfully we've been training for these steps at our hostel. We're on the fifth floor so we're used to going up and down the stairs everyday. And we tend to forget things which means we have to run up and down multiple times a day. True story. We just went the wrong way so now we have to go down all of these steps. And back up. Background music playing. Well, that concludes our sweat fest. I mean trek. It was great I just wish it could have been twenty degrees cooler. Background music playing. Purrrrr So we finally made it to Guilin. We've been waiting for things to cool down and now that it is evening we're going to give you a little tour of the place. Background music playing. So I'm not sure we want to be walking through that tunnel when it gets a bit later in the day because it is pretty dark in there and there are no lights. And people aren't using their headlights. Background music playing. When I was in Guilin two years ago this area right here used to all be traditional homes. One of my favorite restaurants was here. A really good Chinese restaurant. I used to love wandering around here. Now it's just new development. Background music playing. So this is the Guilin main square. It gets really busy here at night. Lots of shops, restaurants, eateries. You can do it all here. Background music playing. Chinese singing. Background music playing. So we are now at the lake and the main attraction are the these two pagodas that light up at night. Background music playing. Oh, that mapo tofu looks so good. Really generous sized portion. Mix it in with my rice a bit. Please don't be course. Oh hot! Oh hot! Too hot to handle? It's nice and spicy. Really flavorful. Fresh tofu. Mmmmmmm. What are you having over there? Over here I've got deep fried taro balls. And as you can see they have a generous amount of caramel sauce. Really sweet and delicious. Really crunchy on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside. Really sweet. Delicious. It's almost like a dessert. Honking noises. Well, that's our first night in Guilin. I think we're both ready to get some rest and tomorrow we're going to visit some rice terraces, so we'll make a video there.",False,20131007 - Things to do in Guilin and Yangshuo Top Attractions Travel Guide.en.srt

We're at the Avenue of Stars here and a Symphony of Lights show is just about to begin. We better walk fast in order to get a good spot. Wait, can I gather my thoughts first. So we already saw the Symphony of Lights Show once before when we took a tour of the harbor. We just finished our bus tour and we've been let off at the Avenue of the Stars, so we're going to grab a spot and watch the show from the land. Background music playing. The Avenue of stars features many special statues. None more iconic than the Bruce Lee one. Who is Bruce Lee? I don't think I've ever seen a film of his. Background music playing. As you can see there is a huge audience here all lined up waiting to see a Symphony of Lights show. Background music playing. The world's longest running light and lazer show. Music playing and crowd cheering. Background music playing. Music, cheering, and clapping. Background music playing. Rock music performance. Background music playing. Yeah! Woo Hoo! Background music playing. Music playing. Violin playing. I think of Ace Venture when I hear this song. We ended up having to wait two hours to get a table here in the Tea Salon. Initially they told us it would only be a one hour wait but by the time one hour had passed we had waited so long that we figured it was probably worth it to stay and now Sam is not very pleased. He's looking at me with evil eyes. Are you freaking kidding me. Sam is hiding behind the camera because he's so angry that he had to wait for two hours. That now I'm being punished by having to be on camera all alone. Okay, so if your'e looking to go afternoon tea in Hong Kong. The Peninsula is the place to come. This is the oldest hotel in all of Hong Kong and it's super popular. The lineups really speak for themselves. background music playing. Symphony orchestra. Mmmm, so I got my self a nice little tea cup of mango tea. And it smells like fresh mangoes. So good. Mmmm, tropical. Background music playing. We've already dug into the food. We couldn't help it. If you go to the bottom here we have the scones which we can eat with the clotted cream and jam. Over here we have some nice finger sandwiches with salmon, cucumber and up top we have the cakes and the macaroons and lots of other treats. So here I'm preparing my scones with clotted cream and jam. This is a favorite of mine. Whenever I go to London to visit my friend Rebecca I always end up staying at her house and I eat scones with clotted cream and jam three times a day. I eat it for breakfast, for lunch and also for my late night snack. So I always get fat when I go over there. Symphony music playing. Background music playing. The food was amazing. I think it was definitely worth the two hour wait. Although, I would have preferred not having to wait that long. Some favorites were the little lemon meringue tarts in a chocolate shell. Plus I really liked the scones with the clotted cream. Then they had sandwiches with salmon that were amazing. So I'm a happy girl. So I think it's kind of funny that we had to wait two hours in line but it only took us 30 minutes to finish off all of the food in front of us. That doesn't make sense. Background music playing. We are visiting Victoria Peak. One thing I find fascinating about Hong Kong is that they use bamboo scaffolding to make buildings. Unbelievable and it works. Background music playing. So we're on the tram now and we're traveling all the way up to Victoria Peak and it's really steep. Background music playing. Well, well what do you think? We're so high up it's scary. I'm not going near the edge. Background music playing. So we took the tram all the way up and it was a bit of a scary ride because it is super steep and you're kind of leaning back in your seat kind of holding on to the rail in front of you. But we survived and the views are pretty impressive. Like once we got up here we had to go through a mall like just several levels and now we're up here on top and it's a beautiful sunny day. It's nice. How many time have you been here? This is my second time here. My first time here was 2008. My very first time I went backpacking, so that's a long time ago. Has it changed a lot? Well, there is some new buildings obviously yeah. So the skyline has changed a little bit but when I came before it was late at night and this place was packed. It's nice to come around this of day between say four and six o'clock because there is hardly anyone here. We can find little quiet areas to just rest in the shade. It's great. Hong Kong without a doubt has the most impressive skyline I've ever seen. Just phenomenal. Background music playing. Background music playing. There are many ways to get around Hong Kong. This is the Star Ferry. It's super convenient. It's a boat that comes by roughly every seven minutes. It's really cheap. You just hop on and it takes you from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island or vice versa. Background music playing. Well, we made it to Hong Kong and tonight we're going to be taking a fun tour around the harbor where we're going to see some amazing views of the Hong Kong skyline. Background music playing. I've got my glass of wine. White wine and I'm ready to enjoy the views. background music playing. Every night here in Hong Kong there is a Symphony of Lights show that starts at eight o'clock and it's really spectacular. All of the buildings light up and there is these lasers that are shooting off and music. It's not to be missed. Background music playing. We had a great time on the Aqua Luna. It was awesome to see all of the different sights and the buildings all lit up with the light show and we got to enjoy that with a nice glass of wine. It was my first time in Hong Kong and I thought the views were unbeatable so I definitely recommend it if you're in the city. So it's finally a beautiful sunny day here in Hong Kong, so today we're visiting Hong Kong Park. Background music playing. So it's one hundred and five steps to the top. We're going to show you some views of Hong Kong and I'm going to beat because he's too slow. Background music playing. It was definitely worth climbing up all those stairs even though I lost because these are some of the best free views of the city. background music playing. I'm kind of hoping Sam gets wet here. Get wet Sam. background music playing. So we got to Hong Kong about three days ago and it had been raining non-stop for those three days but now the skies have finally cleared so it's really nice to be able to walk around and enjoy the park.. Background music playing. Oh, it's too fat. Oh! That squirrel is in trouble. It's so funny. So we've signed up to take part in a few different cultural activities while we're here in Hong Kong and today we're doing a Chinese tea appreciation ceremony. This is taking place in Hong Kong Park. There is a little tea house just in the center of the park and it's absolutely free of charge. You just need to sign up in advance through the Hong Kong Tourism board. background music playing. So today we're doing a Sampan boat tour in an area known as Aberdeen outside of central Hong Kong. This is an area that is home to the Tangka people or the boat people who actually live aboard these little ships, so it'll be an interesting outing. And there are over six hundred junk boats still in this area. Some of them enjoy modern amenities such as internet and tv. Background music playing. Background music playing. Background music playing. We're hungry in Hong Kong and that can only mean one thing. We're going out for lunch and we're going to eat dim sum. So we're going to be eating at Tim Ho Wan it's a Michelin Star restaurant here in Mong Kok in Hong Kong and it's one of our favorite places. We've been here, I don't know, maybe five times in the span of week, so we're going to show you what you can get inside. Background music playing. So they have a pretty cool menu over here. Thankfully it's in English not just Chinese, so when you first sit down at the table you just check-off the food items you'd like to order, you specify a quantity and then they bring it to your table as it is ready. Background music playing. Tasty Pu-erh tea from Yunnan Province, it's a dark fermented tea. My oh my, all of the food is arriving at once and over here we have a special little package with sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf and this rice comes with beef and chicken. It's really tasty. One of our favorites. Steaming hot. Background music playing. This is going to be hot. Hahaha! Oh, it is hot. I need a second to tell you about it. So yeah, this sticky rice is really good. I think it's actually called glue rice on the menu and it just has a very sticky consistency as you can see. You can just pick it up with chopsticks and it's been cooked with meat and chicken, so it has a nice meaty flavor to it. Out of all the different kinds of dim sum I've ever tried this is probably one of the most filling by far. Background music playing. Well, we certainly polished that off except for the bone. So next up I'm trying the glutinous rice dumping filled with meat. It's been deep-fried. Ow, hot. Everything is hot. Mmmmm. Well, you can't see the inside right now but it does have meat. Let me prove it. You can see it there. Mmmm. Looks good. It's like a ball of sticky rice with meat inside. Background music playing. And when it comes to dim sum this is my all-time personal favorite the barbecue pork bun. But this is a special variety of it baked barbecue pork bun. So, bite time. Mmmmm. Show us the inside. Ooooh, look at that barbecue pork. Yum. It's just so sweet and flavorful. The inside. The barbecue pork bun. And the outside of the bun it's so delicately crispy. Well, we've got one more dish coming. It is called tonic and pedelar cake. How does that sound to you? MMMMnnnn. Let me correct you on that. It's called tonic, medlar and petal cake as in flower petals. So I'm not really sure what to expect maybe something that tastes like perfume. And it was from the dessert section. Background music playing. I really hope Iike it. It's cold. Like gelatin. Sweet like honey. Michelin star quality that even a cheapskate extraordinaire can afford. Lets see the total.

So we're back on the Big Bus again this time we're doing a night tour and I'm really excited about this one especially because Hong Kong really shines at night. It's an amazing city by day but there is just something spectacular about it at night time. Delicious double chocolate brownie cookies. Best enjoyed on top of a double decker bus. Hahaha.

We're hungry in Hong Kong and that can only mean one thing. We're going out for lunch and we're going to eat dim sum. So we're going to be eating at Tim Ho Wan it's a Michelin Star restaurant here in Mong Kok in Hong Kong and it's one of our favorite places. We've been here, I don't know, maybe five times in the span of week, so we're going to show you what you can get inside. Background music playing. So they have a pretty cool menu over here. Thankfully it's in English not just Chinese, so when you first sit down at the table you just check-off the food items you'd like to order, you specify a quantity and then they bring it to your table as it is ready. Background music playing. Tasty Pu-erh tea from Yunnan Province, it's a dark fermented tea. My oh my, all of the food is arriving at once and over here we have a special little package with sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf and this rice comes with beef and chicken. It's really tasty. One of our favorites. Steaming hot. Background music playing. This is going to be hot. Hahaha! Oh, it is hot. I need a second to tell you about it. So yeah, this sticky rice is really good. I think it's actually called glue rice on the menu and it just has a very sticky consistency as you can see. You can just pick it up with chopsticks and it's been cooked with meat and chicken, so it has a nice meaty flavor to it. Out of all the different kinds of dim sum I've ever tried this is probably one of the most filling by far. Background music playing. Well, we certainly polished that off except for the bone. So next up I'm trying the glutinous rice dumping filled with meat. It's been deep-fried. Ow, hot. Everything is hot. Mmmmm. Well, you can't see the inside right now but it does have meat. Let me prove it. You can see it there. Mmmm. Looks good. It's like a ball of sticky rice with meat inside. Background music playing. And when it comes to dim sum this is my all-time personal favorite the barbecue pork bun. But this is a special variety of it baked barbecue pork bun. So, bite time. Mmmmm. Show us the inside. Ooooh, look at that barbecue pork. Yum. It's just so sweet and flavorful. The inside. The barbecue pork bun. And the outside of the bun it's so delicately crispy. Well, we've got one more dish coming. It is called tonic and pedelar cake. How does that sound to you? MMMMnnnn. Let me correct you on that.

So that is 77 Hong Kong dollars which is just under 10 US dollars. Background music playing. Dim Sum Square! We're been walking for what feels like at least an hour to find this place. We actually ate over here yesterday when we took a food tour of the city and it was amazing. So Sam wanted to find it again. And we didn't have any map or any directions with us, so we have to kind of place it by memory. And we did a good job. Yes, we're here. Let's go eat. So this place has a pretty cool menu. They just give you a slip of paper and you check off which food items you'd like to have. Fortunately, this one also has English writing, so it makes our job much easier. Let's see. background music playing. So if you've been following along with our food videos for a while you'll probably remember we had Dim Sum several times in Malaysia. It was excellent but this is where Dim Sum originated from. From Hong Kong. And it's just a notch better. So in many of the other dim sum restaurants we've been to especially in Malaysia they come around to your table with push carts and you're able to select what kind of Dim Sum you'd like to eat. But because we're here in Hong Kong and space is so limited you have to order from a menu and they just bring it to your table. There is no way they can push a little cart around in this small confined space. So Dim Sum literally means small bite and if you were to invite someone out for dim sum you would actually invite them out for tea. background music playing. So this is my favorite one. The shrimp dumpling. Even though I normally don't like seafood. I don't like shrimp. It's okay when it is in dumpling form. I'm going to dip it there. This is really hot. Still steamy. Nice and plump. Background music playing. So this here is a new one we're trying. I've never had this before. It's a deep fried glutinous rice ball with pork stuffing inside. So I can already tell it's crispy. That is sooo sooo good! It's almost a bit like a mini meat pie but it's got that stickiness of the glutinous rice inside. Oh, it's so good. Oooh, more food. Background music playing. So this is another favorite of ours. It's called the crispy barbecue pork bun. And what Iike about it is almost sugar coated. It's really sweet on the outside and the barbecue sauce inside is also quite sweet. So it feels like a dessert even though it is meat. Mmmmmm. It's nice and fluffy like a pastry. Like a French pastry. Oh, yeah. What do you got there? Mango pudding for dessert. It's not homemade. I was expecting a little homemade bowl but its nice. So this wonderful dim sum feast which consisted of four different dishes and tea only came to seventy two Hong Kong dollars which was a steal. Basically that's less than ten US dollars to feed both of us.",False,"20131004 - Eating Dim Sum in Hong Kong, China (σÉâσ£¿ΘªÖµ╕»τÜäΘ╗₧σ┐â).en.srt"

I'm a little sad about it but I'm in Finland so I have to try Reindeer. Reindeer, is it tasty or what? It really is. It has a very rich taste. It is must different from the meatballs we had before the other day. This definitely has a real much stronger taste to it. If I had to compare it to something it tastes like a really strong seasoned roast beef. I'm going to think of it as salami. Okay, it tastes like salami. There we go. It's kind of like a roast beef. It's kind of sour, right? Sour and salty. Okay. Do you like it? Yeah. Is it growing on you? Not growing on me. We're going to give you a little tour of a Finnish supermarket and we'll see what strange food items we can find. So smoked salmon is a very popular food over here. You eat it with rye bread. That is something we had almost everyday. We're also buying some Salmiakki, which is black salted licorice. I detested the taste of it but Sam really liked it and apparently so does his Dad, so this is for him. This is a present for my Dad. For George. So in Finland there are many different kinds of alcoholic beers and beverages to choose from. They even have licorice flavored Salmiakki beer. So chocolate is extremely popular in Finland and there is no brand more Karl Fazer. So black rye bread is also really popular. We've been eating this daily with butter, cheese and smoked salmon on top. Canada represent. We've got some Maple Syrup and of course the lumberjack. Alright, tonight we've got a special Finnish treat to show you. This here is called Salmiakki and it is black extremely salty licorice. So my sister Ashley has been to Finland before and she specifically told me to stay away from this nasty candy. She says it is the worst tasting thing ever out there and that I will spit it out within seconds. So I'm not really looking forward to eating a piece of it but Sam here is quite adamant about it. So this Salmiakki here, this black licorice has sometimes been referred to by foreigners as a kind of a fear factor food that television show the Fear Factor where people are dared to eat something that seems disgusting and really strange. What gives this the salty taste is ammonium chloride and this is very popular in Nordic countries - especially in Finland. That doesn't sound edible. Alright, so here is a piece of the Salmiakki - the black licorice. And I have to say that I've grown up eating licorice in Canada. It is probably quite a bit sweeter than this and I'm a big licorice fan, so I'm hopeful that I am going to like this even though it is apparently exceptionally salty. So here we go. Yeah, it is an explosion of flavors going on. That's just wow. That is very salty but I like it. Here is another piece. I have a bar of milk chocolate handy over here because I know I'm probably going to need to wash away the flavor of this nasty looking thing. I'm just taking a small bite okay. Yummy? Arrggghhh. Did you just spit it out? Did you spit it out? I don't like licorice. I've never liked licorice and that is just foul. Okay, where is your chocolate piece now? Better? Good, because that means I get more. I'm going to put some more pieces in my mouth here. I'm glad you don't like it because that means I get to eat the whole bag. We are just about to have a simple picnic lunch. We got some smoked salmon. Ooh la lah. That looks tasty. We've got ourselves a nice baguette sandwich to enjoy in the park, a lovely pasta salad with feta cheese and some fizzy drinks to go along. So we're just going to enjoy the view and savor our dinner. The smoked salmon is easily my favorite part of this little picnic. It is a wonderful cheap meal. We were able to get all of this food for just roughly ten Euro. So instead of going out for dining tonight we just decided to hit up a local grocery store and pick out some things that look good. This has turned into a fantastic little feast here on the park bench. Hello, bird. So we are having breakfast right now in the basement. It has a bit of a dungeon-y feel and I love that we get tin cups. It really adds to the whole prison feel. I almost feel like I'm a prisoner here but with really good food. So my favorite part about breakfast are these pastries. They are called Keralian pies and apparently they are filled with potato. They are supposed to look like brains. Taste like brains? Oh, yeah. And my favorite part of breakfast here is just this awesome combination of trail mix, fresh berries and thick yogurt. Wow. Tonight for dinner we've decided to have a simple Finnish meal. A do it yourself meal. We went to a Finnish grocery store and just loaded up on a whole bunch of different goodies and we're going to have a small little feast. I have really been enjoying eating lots of black rye bread with salmon and dill on top. I think it is the best meal ever. And I personally like to alternate between a hummus spread and a cream cheese spread because those are my two favorite spreads and salmon is my favorite fish. This is just an amazing little snack meal. I'm going to miss this so much when I go back to Thailand. Wow. Okay, so when we were in Helsinki last week I tired a pear cider and now that we are in a super market I noticed the same brand but with a pomegranate, so that is what I'm drinking right now. It is so nice and fruity. I'm really thirsty. She is going to get drunk like a skunk. Hey. And I've got some beer and I'm assuming it is Finnish beer. I don't really know. It could be Swedish or something else but I'm guessing it is Finnish because of the 'nen' I've noticed a lot of Finnish words and especially last names end with that. So let's assume it is Finnish beer. That's good stuff. This is also really good. It is like a potato salad and we're too lazy to get our own plates so we're just eating it right from the container. Having a do it yourself Finnish picnic is a great way to save money while having a delicious meal. So we're just having our meal here on the porch of I guess the guest house that we're staying at here and it has got fantastic views. Check it out. We've found reindeer meatballs, so we're going to go try those right now. Reindeer meatballs here we go. Could we please try the Reindeer meatballs. Yeah, sure. Which are the meatballs. Those are big meatballs. I think those are potatoes. Would you like some vegetables as well? Oh, sure. How about garlic sauce? Um, sure, yeah. Well no, I'm not ready but jeez. Okay, I am filming. I don't think I have much of a choice. That seems like a big enough chunk right? It is and what are you having? Reindeer meatballs. First bite. Is it good? These taste like a regular meatball. Okay. Yeah, it doesn't have a very strong reindeer flavor. It is more garlic-y from all of the sauce we put over top. And these have to be the biggest meatballs I have ever seen in my whole life. Okay, let's see what you think of it. They don't have as distinct of a flavor as I thought they may but what I really liked here is this garlic sauce that has been put over top.",False,"20130825 - Eating Finnish Cuisine including Reindeer Meat, Salmiakki, Karelian pastry, Salmon & Rye Bread.en.srt"

We are going to be trying some local foods centered around salmon. I'm really excited about the pizza. I've never had salmon as a topping. For our appetizer we ordered some smoked salmon with dill on a nice piece of rye bread and we've also got a really tasty potato salad over here. A big bite. The salmon keeps getting better and better. That is probably the best bite of salmon I've had since I've been in Finland. Here is my wonderful thin crust pizza. Come have a look. It has lots of tomatoes, cheese and greens. I think a few things got lost in translation because we were under the impression that it was going to be a salmon pizza. This looks just as good. Let's dig in. How is that? You're going to like this a lot. So what really makes this pizza delicious for me is the cheese and the olive oil drizzled on top. That is so tasty. Okay, so up next we're trying the chocolate fondant, which has strawberries and cream. Try some strawberry too. Look at the inside. Nice and gooey. You can tell it has just been baked fresh out of the oven. It is so decadent and sweet. That was a really nice meal at a local cafe. The place was recommended to us by one of our local contacts and we really enjoyed the food. It came to 27 Euros and considering we got a entree, a main dish and dessert we think that is a pretty fair price for Europe. Yeah, we ended up sharing everything. Yeah, and we are stuffed.",False,"20130803 - Eating Finnish Salmon, Pizza & Dessert at the Strandhotellet in Dalsbruk Taalintehdas, Finland.en.srt"

It is about seven thirty in the morning and the place is just full of activity. People are selling fresh vegetables and fruits, so let's go see what we can find. Waking up this morning has been one of the best ideas we've done since we've come to Hoi An. We've been treated to this market almost entirely to ourselves. We actually haven't noticed another foreigner here yet. Wow. One of the quirks of this market is that they sell live chickens and ducks. That is not something you see in the supermarket everyday. In tiny little cages. Here at the market you can find all kinds of exotic fruits that are associated with SE Asia such as papaya, mangosteen, rambutan, dragon fruit. It is all here. From a birds eye view perspective it is just a sea of conical hats. It is too bad we forgot to bring ours today. Today we are doing something that I've been wanting to do ever since we got to Hoi An and that is shopping. There are said to be over two hundred different tailors just in Hoi An alone. This is a city where you come to have your clothes custom made. You can get dresses, shirts, suits, shoes, pursues made and they can copy the latest designs. You just have to show them the magazine with what you want and they'll recreate it for you. Shopping for clothes - especially dresses - is not my realm of expertise. We're going shopping. Having fun changing over there. I'm having trouble getting into my dress. Oh, it looks nice. Do you like it? It feels like the right size. This is dress number two. How do you like this one? It's got flowers. It is nice. I can do a little smaller. Maybe a little smaller in the back. It's a good size for you. Do you like it? I do. Yes, you like all three of them? We are staying here two more days. Two more days? What are we having done right now? I'm getting my dresses made, so that they fit me properly. Where are you going now? After here, we go to Hanoi. It is very far away. So we are just waiting here for Audrey's dresses to get some minor alterations done on them. Were they too big or too small? They were a little too big on me but I am so excited for them to be ready. I'm quite pleased with my purchases. I ended up getting three dresses and I probably could have gotten more because the lady just kept pushing me to try this one, try that one. She really wanted you to get that forth dress. Oh yeah, but we had to cut it off at three. Overall, we paid eighteen dollars per dress plus a slight discount and that included alterations and everything. So a little tip for anyone who is think of going shopping in Hoi An. I would say just walk around the different streets and see what the shops have to offer. See what kinds of styles you like and then go into a store and don't be afraid to bargain a little and ask for different patterns and different fabrics. They can make anything you want. Today we are having lunch at the Mermaid Restaurant in Hoi An. This is a very famous restaurant in town and that is because it has two very special secret recipes, so we are going to be trying those two dishes today. The first dish that we are going to be introducing you to is called White Rose. As you can see over here it is a shrimp dumpling made using a translucent dough and it was named 'White Rose' when the French came because they thought it looked like a flower the way it is all bunched up together. It is a secret recipe unique to Hoi An and supplied by one family to the rest of the town. I'm going to pick this one up as you can see it looks like a little rose. How does it taste? It is really tasty. It has a nice shrimp paste and it also has some roasted garlic on top, so it has a really nice flavor. The next dish that we're going to be trying is called Cao Lau. It consists of noodles, pork and greens. It is also unique to Hoi An. The Cao Lau gets its special flavor from the water that comes from a well outside of the town. Or this distinct taste could just be from its spice caramelized broth. Delicious noodles. They remind me a lot of the Japanese Udon noodles. The meat is really chewy and flavorful and you can tell it has been sitting in the broth for a little while. This meal came to about five US Dollars which is a bit pricey for a local dish but then again we are eating at a famous restaurant with two secret recipes so that is what you pay. Here we are just biking through the streets of Hoi An. Here we have our little ticket for sightseeing around Hoi An. The way it works is that you pay six dollars and you get a ticket that grants you access into five different historic sites around town and you just show up at the entrance. They snip off one of these little tabs and you're good to go. Here we are at the Japanese covered bridge. It was built in 1593. Construction on this bridge began on the year of the monkey and finished on the year of the dog and for that reason one side of the bridge is guarded by a monkey and the other by a dog. Here we are at the most popular pedestrian bridge in town. I'm standing here at a small square and this is where a lot of fabulous performances take place - especially at night time. We are at Quang Dong Assembly hall. It's a place of worship for the Cantonese community. Up next we are visiting the Assembly Hall of the Fujian Chinese. This place now acts as a temple to the Goddess Tian Hao who is from the Fujian province in China. Hoi An is the kind of city that can easily be explored at night. It is beautifully lit. Today we are biking out to Tra Que which is a little village. We're going for a special organic meal at a restaurant that grows its own vegetables and herbs. Oh, wow! Can you hear the sound of the water. This is Sam on the Waterwheel. You're a natural. If this isn't fun I don't know what is. You should move out here and take up farming. So this place is amazing. It's like a little organic oasis where they just grow different herbs and vegetables. Everyone is farming and it is so peaceful and quiet and it is beautiful. Look at all of the flowers around this. We have a very special drink here. It is called the water wheel drink. It's made with lemon basil seed and ginger. Let's take a sip of that. It tastes very healthy. In a good way or a bad way? In a pretty good way. Okay. Tra Que is a small farming community village located two kilometers northeast of the Ancient Hoi An town area. We just came here for dinner but if you decide to visit this village you can also work with the farmers for the day, you can take a rice paper making class or you can take a cooking class. If you've been following along with our recent food videos you probably have noticed we've been having these pancakes a lot and they are delicious. I have to say that the presentation of these ones down here looks the best. So these here are the best country pancakes we've had. What I really like about them is that they are not as oily or greasy as the other ones. They have a little bit of a fluffier texture. So this lovely presented dish is called three friends and there are three friends right in my hand. We have shrimp, pork and vegetables wrapped around. Pop that in your mouth. Friendly? I've got some good pals in my mouth. These tres amigos are almost too pretty to eat. Thank you. Easy. So here we have our colorful papaya salad and I didn't realize it was going to be this big. I started to think we ordered way too much food. Are you kidding me? With me here? Too much food? I'll take care of that. Well to sum up this meal I can honestly say this is the best dinner I've had since I've been in Vietnam. I absolutely loved the dishes. You could just taste the freshness in every single dish we had. The prices were really affordable. The portions were generous and it was cooked really healthy. Nothing was greasy or too oily. It was just absolute delight to come here and eat. I definitely agree. I think the long bike ride out here was definitely worth it and it is nice eating in such a quiet and peaceful setting just being surrounded by the farm. So we highly recommend it if you're in Hoi An. Today we are having lunch at the Green Moss in Hoi An and this happens to be a cooking school but it has more of a casual feel. Basically, you choose two dishes from the menu and then you pay an additional two dollars and you get to go into the kitchen and cook it yourself. That is what we'll be doing. Believe me when I say this ""If I can do it. Anyone can."" We are entering into the kitchen and we're making a cooking video. Audrey is up first. First like this? You roll one time. So you cover it up? So then we get the sides tucked in? And then we finish as tight as possible. There you go. Not so bad. It is great. It is like we're an exclusive peak into the kitchen. This is how we're making Pho. Can I try? Two tablespoons. Here are the first few dishes we've prepared. We have the Pho and the fresh spring rolls. Let's go eat it. Take them to the table and devour them. Here is the spring roll that Audrey personally rolled herself. No, I didn't. You rolled it. Do you remember? Let's see how it turned out. This is one of my favorite dishes at this restaurant. It is just such a nice fat spring roll. How is that Pho? Delicious, and prior to learning how to make this I didn't realize how many different ingredients went into this dish. You can really taste the flavors. Next up we will be making a vegetable Cao Lau. So the Cao Lau noodles are made from the water used an ancient well and apparently it is quite secret. Not only in Hoi An. Unique noodles to Hoi An. It is harder. It's a crispy noodle. Now we're making our very last dish the vegetable pancake and it happens to be my favorite one. We've got a lot of multitasking going on. We've got the tofu simmering, we've got the noodles being steamed over here and we've got the pancake mixture ready to be spread on the frying pan. So that is when we know it is done? Okay. Take fermented soy bean sauce. Here is the finished product and this is round two of our feast. It was a fascinating experience getting to see how all of this food was made in the kitchen. We're going to show you how to roll the country pancake in a rice paper, so that it is easy for dipping into the sauce. And a big bite. Oh, yeah. The pancake is nice and crispy and the sauce is kind of sweet. It has a bit of a tomato ketchup base I believe but it is also spicy because we added all of the chilies. It is a nice combination of flavors. How is the Cao Lau? I love it. What really stands out with the Cao lau is the taste of the noodles. They are just really unique to this area and I love them. So the texture of the noodles are a little bit crispy and it almost tastes a little bit like they are under-cooked but that is what makes them quite unique. We just finished our cooking class at Green Moss and it was a little bit different from previous cooking classes we've taken. This one was a little bit less hands on and more watch and learn, which is great because we got to watch a professional make it and the dishes turned out great. Everything was tasty. That is the first kind of cooking class where it has been more of a just a demonstration only that I've taken before. And I really enjoyed it partly because I'm really slow at preparing food but the other reason was it was so hot in that kitchen. I don't think I've ever sweated that much, so I could barely handle being in there as long as I was. Had I been preparing the food I may have passed out on the ground. Today we are eating lunch at the Bale Well in Hoi An. This is a very small local restaurant. They have a fixed menu. Actually there is no menu. They just bring you food and you pay a fixed price and you eat as much as you want. There focus is on country pancakes and spring rolls. Which we both love! You take the salad, cucumber, kimchi and a spring roll. It is going to be crunchy. Now that is a special roll. That has got meat. Thank you very much. So I dip it here? Give it a try Audrey. Here we go. How is that? Wow, hard to bite huh? So you are going to what? Well, Sam here wasn't paying attention to whole assembly process, so I will have to demonstrate how to roll a spring roll. Okay, so we add a little bit of greens including some lettuce. A bit of fumbling with the chopsticks there. Hey, don't be hating. Then she said this is our kimchi which looks a bit different from the kimchi we ate in Korea. This is Vietnamese style Kimchi. It must be pickled vegetables. Then she added a spring roll. Don't forget the meat. Let's try this one. Yeah, try a smaller one. I don't know if it is chicken or beef but it looks good and smells good. Now that is a super loaded roll. Ok, now to roll it tightly. Viola! This is it. Now you add just a little bit of chilly to the sauce. It is kind of a peanut based sauce I think. And we dip and enjoy! Oh, there comes more food. Oh wow, here is the country pancakes. Yum. So this delectable roll. This time instead of the spring roll it has the country pancake inside of it. So we're going to give it a try. Is that better? These rolls are amazing! You've got pancakes, springs rolls, the greens, the skewered satay all in this. Happy boy! And if that feast wasn't enough we've got a little sweet treat to end off with. What flavor did you get? I got cherry. And the dessert just keeps on coming. Now we have fresh pineapples. Do you have any room for that? No, but I'll eat it. Okay, seriously that was the feast of feasts. Normally country pancakes or spring rolls or satay taste great on their own but all wrapped up together in one big roll dipped into a peanut sauce. WOW! Our lunch came to one hundred and eighty thousand Dong which is about nine dollars. I think that is a great price because they just kept bringing out plates and plates of food and we were stuffed and then they were offering us dessert and it was like 'oh, I don't want to turn it down I guess I'll eat it anyway' so yeah it was a great selection there. The service there is really friendly almost in a very unique kind of way. There was one time when the lady was coming over and she looked like it appeared she was going to be wrapping up a roll for us but instead she just grabbed a satay and plopped it right in Audrey's mouth and at the very end of the meal she came over and noticed I was looking hot and she undid a napkin for me. I thought she was going to put it in my hands. Oh, no. She just came and rubbed my whole face right down. Oh yeah.",False,20130617 - Things to do in Hoi An Vietnam ∩╜£ Top Attractions Travel Guide To Vietnam (Ultimate Compilation).en.srt

In order for us to get here we had to go through a bit of a market. I've never seen so many turtles in one place. Today we are visiting the Temple of Supreme Bliss and I'm feeling particularly blissful this morning. Let's have a look. This impressive temple took nearly twenty years to build and was funded almost entirely by donations. Even today they're doing more renovations. This temple is located on a hilltop in Air Itam and it offers excellent views of the city below. Today we are visiting a place that is an important part of George Town's heritage - the Clan Jetties. These are the last bastions of old Chinese settlements. One of the things that has surprised me most about visiting the Clan Jetties is that people live here with their pets, so even though their houses are on stilts above the water they still keep dogs, cats and it works. Here we've found some friendly little doggies. Yes. Leave it to me to find puppies. Cats. Hello, cat. It is purring. Cat, let's steal you. Let's take you home. You can fit in my backpack. Well, we've encountered a lot of friendly cats and dogs but not this one. For breakfast this morning we're having one of my all-time favorite foods - dim sum - and there are so many restaurants to choose from here in George Town but I'm going to my favorite. Let's go. There is a recurring theme in most of our morning videos and that is I'm usually not awake and that I'm being dragged out of bed to go do something. This morning it is Chinese breakfast again. What do we got? I believe those are shrimp dumplings. Could I have a cup of tea darling? You may and this is very hot. Burning yourself for love. No dim sum meal is complete without a cup of tea. Sam and his buns. Barbecue pork bun and red bean paste bun. Hello! Today we are visiting the Botanical Gardens just outside of George Town. If you look up over there you can see some monkeys. Actually there is another one there. That one is easier to spot. That looks like a bearded one. Hi monkey. We woke up kind of late this morning and we were worried that it was going to be too hot by the time we got here but fortunately this place is so shady and lush and it is so much fresher than it is in George Town - especially down the side trails. It is so much cooler. Here is a small area where you can actually walk along the ocean side. We've seen everything going on along here. There is a large cruise ship in the back, there are people fishing and there is small tiny little boat. You've got everything from big and luxurious to very small and humble. It is all out here. Fort Cornwallis was built after the cities founder Francis Light in 1786. Those looking to visit Fort Cornwallis, it is open daily from 9 AM until 7 PM. Penang is known for its distinct neighborhoods and none is more colorful than Little India. As you might expect there are also lots of Indian restaurants in Little India so it is the perfect place to get some Palak Paneer or curry or Naan bread, Lassis or anything! One of the things that you can find in Little India are lots of Saris stores and Bengal stores. Lots of shopping to be done. George Town is such a great place to wander because of all of the crumbling colonial architecture and the back-alleys. This city has so much character. Meow! Georgetown is highly negotiable on foot and one of my favorite things to do in this entire city is just to get out and randomly explore all over the place. You never know what kind of adventures you're going to get into. George Town is a world heritage site and around the city you can find little forms of art that tell you a little bit about Georgetown's history.

Today we are standing in front of Malaysia's most iconic building the Petronas Towers. There are lots of different vantage points around the park so that you can get your shot with the Petronas Towers and this is one of them. The Petronas Towers took six years to build and they were the tallest buildings in Asia until Tapei 101 took them over and I've been to Taipei 101 and these are more impressive. Background music playing. We're standing at Merdeka Square which means Independence Square. This used to be a former Cricket Field but now it's being used for something completely different. And just behind us we have the Sultan Abdul Sahmad Building which is quite impressive. Background music playing. Massive. Absolutely gigantic flag in the back. Background music playing. And this flag over here it absolutely massive. The flagpole is 95 meters tall and it is one of the biggest in all of SE Asia. Background music playing. We're going to take you on a high speed journey from KL Sentral station to KL LCC station at night. Let's go for a ride. Background music playing. Continuous background music playing. Bright and early. It's on seven twenty in the morning. And I've been dragged out of bed by someone to go visit the Batu Caves early in the day. And how are we getting there? We are taking the commuter train from KL Sentral. One ringgit each! It was cheap. Background music playing. Today we're visiting the Batu Caves. It's only thirteen kilometers north of Kuala Lumpur and this is an important Hindu Shrine. The caves takes its name from the Batu river and is dedicated to Lord Murugan. Looks like it's feeding time for the pigeons over here. Bird noises. Background music. Who said money or food couldn't buy you friends. Background music playing. Here I am on step number one. I've only got two hundred and seventy two more of these bad boys to climb. Up we go. Background music playing. There are lots of Mac ques or little monkeys. It's the first time I've seen monkeys up close, so it's all that I'm taking pictures of at the temple. Finally, two hundred and seventy two steps later we have made it to the top. Background music playing. Music being played - traditional style drums and horns So this is actually my third time coming to the Batu Caves but this is by far the earliest I've come and what a difference it makes. There is hardly anyone here. It feels like we have the place to ourselves. We've had intimate encounters with pigeons, monkeys, roosters. There is a performance going on. My tip to anyone is to come early. We beat the first tour bus group here. Look at them coming. Hahahaha! Background music playing. Background music playing. So today we're having dinner at a great little restaurant. It's located right across from the Pudaraya bus terminal in Kuala Lumpur. And it's Indian food. My favorite. Nothing like refreshing fruit drinks to start the meal. Here is our food. Ooooh! Nice. Thank you. Background music playing. So what we are having today is called Roti Canai and it is an Indian flat bread. I got one that has cheese inside and I'm going to dip it in the curry sauce. And the roti canai is actually the Malaysian form of Indian bread. Oh yeah! What we're having here is roti canai. And Roti means bread in Hindi and Malay. Canai in malay means to roll out the dough. How do you roll it out? Show me;) Nice. It's made with flat egg flour water and in special cases where there is special ingredients like this one right here. It has cheese. Sam's feeling a little shy because there is people watching him eat right now. Is it the freckles? Is it the t-shirt? Is it because he's using his hands? It's a spectacle. What could it be? Background music playing. There are two ways to eat roti canai. By hand or by utensil. And believe me I will not give up an opportunity to use my hands. Demonstrate for us. Mix it up good. Ewww, that's sloppy. Hahaha. You just wiped it on your pants. No, I didn't. And Audrey here will be having it using utensils. Well, I on the other hand am eating like a lady using a fork and spoon.

It is a great place to find food and go shopping. Let's head over there. One of the best ways to explore Melaka is early in the morning to take your bike. A lot of guest houses have them and just explore all around especially the Chinatown area. One of the reasons I'm loving Malacca so far is the crumbling colonial architecture. A lot of the buildings along the main road have been restored. Once you start biking down the back alleys you see places like this. We have our tickets in hand and tonight we are going to be doing the Melaka river cruise. This city really lights up at night. I'm really enjoying this right now because I've actually only walked along this area. I've never taken the boat and I've never done this at night. This is awesome. We are going to take a rickshaw tour around Malacca next. It is quite decorated rickshaw isn't it? Why don't you hop in? Comfy? Yes. Can you honk that for us? We're going on an hour long tour here. It cost 40 Ringgit, which is approximately 13 USD. Not the cheapest but it is going to be a really fun way to go around and see Melaka. Yes and our rickshaw is all decked out with flowers and bling bling and it looks pretty. This is one of the stops along our rickshaw tour and this place is called Porta De Santiago. We've got fantastic views from up here. As you can see behind there is some really unique looking architecture. It is extremely hot this afternoon and there is only one way to beat the heat. I'd say it is about Cendol time. Here we have our delicious treat. We are having Cendol right now and it is a dessert that is really popular in Southeast Asia. It is made using shaved ice, palm sugar and it has some coconut milk and little green worm like creatures that are actually made using rice. And beans. That is it. In the Chinatown area of Malacca there are a lot of different temples to explore. Here we are going to take a look at Cheng Hoon Teng temple, which celebrates a number of different faiths - Confucianism, Taoism and Chinese Buddhism. Let's go in. It is lunchtime here in Malacca, so we're about to go to a Baba-Nyonya type of restaurant, which is a mix of Chinese and Malaysian cuisine. This is a real hole in the wall kind of place. It is. I am going to be showing you a Nonya Laksa, which is a spicy curry with a mixture of Malay and Chinese elements. Let's take a look here. It is coconut based curry soup and it is has curd puffs, fish sticks, shrimp and clams added to it. It is very flavorful. What I'm having next is called Rojak. That is the Malay word for mixture. It is a refreshing salad. Take a look over here. It is made using fruits and vegetables, so it has pineapple, cucumbers, bean sprouts. It is just a really nice refreshing salad on a hot day. Oh yeah. The last of our four dishes is called Popiah. It is a spring roll that has an outside like a crepe. I'll show you the ingredients here. It has a sweet bean and soy sauce. It often has turnips, bean sprouts, omelet, carrots, lettuce, tofu and peanuts on top. It has got everything going on. Take a bite. Classy. Melaka is known for its colonial architecture, so right now we're going to take you down some of the back alleys to show you some of the crumbling buildings and old mansions. For those visiting Malacca, one of the best free things you can possibly do is to take a walk along the Malacca River. Melaka gets really hot during the day, so we've decided to get up early. It is only eight in the morning and we're going to do some exploring along the river. If you continue walking upstream you will come to an area that is just covered in graffiti and street art.

Vegas, Baby! With a weekend to explore Las Vegas we arrived hitting the ground running wanting to pack in as much as we possibly could over a short period of time. Nigh life, music, gambling, entertainment, dancing, walking the Strip and shows in the evening. Driving luxury cars, helicopter tours, exploring the Grand Canyon and marveling at Red Rock Canyon by day. Las Vegas was full of surprises. The following is a Las Vegas travel guide to experience the most out of your vacation to Sin City. It is the best things to do on Las Vegas Strip along with day excursions outside of the city limits. As they say, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. So we aren't in Canada no more! This weekend we actually escaped to Las Vegas so we are going to be spending three days just enjoying winter in the desert and doing cool stuff. And today we're walking down the strip and we're going to show you some of the sights. And the best part - no winter parka right now. Enough walking for a while. I'm starving. Let's get some dinner. We're going to Shake Shack. So when this buzzer goes it's time for me to get my food. It's ready. It's ready. Go get it! There is the man bringing food. Ooh la lah. I'm on a total health kick today. We've got a double burger, cheese fries, peanut butter shake and a root beer float. When in Vegas. I think I found my new favorite burger here at the Shake Shack. They just do their patties to perfection over here. Tell, me. Tell, me! You know what? Nobody does fast food like Americans. They've got it down to a science. It's absolutely unhealthy but so delicious. Argh. We just found a jelly bean Statue of Liberty and I'm going to dare Sam five bucks to lick it. Do it, do it. It's filthy. Don't! This is like Charlie in the Chocolate Factory. This is a very volatile situation. I'm walking into a Hershey's candy store. Ooh la lah. I hope they have free samples. I think I'm about to create my own chocolate bar. Ooh. Let's go white chocolate. I don't know how this works actually. Oh, smile big! Ow! Retake. Retake. Looks good! What did you find there? Two and a half pounds of peanut butter and chocolate. And these are only two cups if you can imagine. One here, one there. So what did you find? I found the largest Hershey chocolate bar in the world. Really? We're going to head back to the hotel and get ready for a show. We're going to be seeing the Michael Jackson Show at the Mandalay Bay but unfortunately we can't bring any cameras in there so we won' t be able to show you that but maybe after the show we'll hit the town again and show you the sights. Not maybe! Definitely! One of the highlights of our three day weekend in Las Vegas was the opportunity to take a helicopter tour over the Grand Canyon. Visiting this natural marvel is already a once in a lifetime experience but getting to see it from above the cherry on top. Every single person on that helicopter smiled the whole way there and back. Here are some of the views from that flight. We just took a helicopter tour with Maverick Helicopters and we've just landed in the Grand Canyon. And you guys, it is so impressive. So what did you think of the flight over? Well, it's been quite a while since I've been in a helicopter. The last time I rode in one was when I was a child. And I just love them so much more than taking a plane. It is just a smoother experience and the helicopter is really versatile. It can zig and zag and go all over the place. Perfect for filming and perfect for views. Were you a little scared considering it was your first ride? My hands were a little clammy from the experience but honestly it is amazing. Like, once you are up in the air and you get to see the landscape below you it is just so amazing. So I'm not scared anymore. The scenery is so distracting you kind of forget that you're nervous. Yeah, and it just becomes a really peaceful experience being up in the air. So it was really cool. So we're fueling up, swapping seats and now it is time to head back to Las Vegas. On the flight back we flew over the Vegas Strip for a bird's eye view of the city. When the helicopter finally touched down we still had giant grins plastered on our faces. This is an experience that will be very hard to top. On our second day in Las Vegas we decided to escape the city and enjoy a bit of the natural scenery. We joined the Pink Jeep Tour for an afternoon exploring Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. Located about a half hour drive outside of the city this is an easy day trip filled with rugged desert landscapes. We spent a few hours driving through the park and also doing a bit of hiking along the way. Here are some of the highlights. Alright, it's time to climb this bad boy. Okay, show us your climbing skills. Scramble up that mountain. Just like an old man. So this over here is the Calico Ridge and the landscape reminds me a lot of Northern Argentina. The toilet. Is the toilet occupied? Hmm. Huh? Hello, there. So we are coming to the end of this outing. We're just doing our last little hike through the park and soon we'll be back in Las Vegas. But how did you enjoy it? It's been awesome. It is so nice. I didn't realize that there was so many scenic areas just outside of Las Vegas. And the best part is that I am building up an appetite for an enormous steak. Or sushi? No, steak. Check out my sweet ride! Test driving a Lamborghini, Ferrari & Porsche in Las Vegas Travel Script: Alright, so this morning we are at Wold Class Driving here in Las Vegas and we are going to be test driving some luxury cars. Feeling the need for speed? Oh, yes! Well, hello hello there. I'm starting out in the Porsche. Ooh La Lah. How are making out so far? Fantastic. I'm a natural guys. I think for my next birthday Sam should buy me a luxury car. Let's win the lottery. Right now we are arriving at Lake Mead National Park. So it is time to switch over to car number two. We've just stopped here at the National Park. We're going to get some shots of the scenery and keep driving. Let's get your cars into gear. Everybody ready? Follow me starting with the Lamborghini first. Lamborghini time, are you ready? I sure am. And last but certainly not least we've got the... I'm driving a Ferrari baby. That was a pretty awesome experience. I ended up driving three different luxury cars. There was the Porsche, the Lamborghini, and the Ferrari and we got to feel the speed in those babies. So out of the three cars which was your favorite? I think I might choose the Porsche just because it was very smooth and easy car to drive. The other ones were a bit harder manlier. So you like that more than the muscle cars? Yeah, but it was a lot of fun. Highly recommended. It is so sad to be leaving but it is our last night in Las Vegas so we're going to go out and try and see as much as we can this evening. Let's go wild. Let's gamble. Why are you at the ATM machine right now? We need some cash to fuel our gambling addiction. It is never ending. The lights. The noise. The ding ding ding ding. This is what a casino sounds like twenty-four seven. We see people gambling here at like five in the morning when we get up for breakfast. And yes we do get up that early. What would a trip to Vegas be like without a little gambling? Sam, even looks like an old gambler today with that hat. Oh, I do. Guess what? We're such cheapskates we're playing with pennies. We're going to the penny machine. They don't even have pennies in Canada anymore, so let's use these American pennies up. Shiver me timbers. I'm playing a pirate game. I'm going to win me some money. Tell us? Alright, I was a pretty lousy pirate, so I'm going to try my luck with this Owl game. Hoot! Hoot! Ding ding ding ding ding. Being the supreme cheapskate that I am I'm cutting my loses after two dollars. So we're here at the Bellagio for the water show. And they have a lot of frequent shows in the evening so we're just waiting for it to start. So we are now at the Cosmopolitan and we are visiting one of the coolest bars in all of Las Vegas. This behind me is the Chandelier.",False,20150326 - Things to do in LAS VEGAS Travel Guide.en.srt

The main difference being that things such as spam and hotdogs, which you can see Audrey moving around here (and she stopped) were found around the American bases. There is also a kind of fusion stew, so there can be any kind of different ingredients thrown in. Sometimes you'll find noodles are put in.
